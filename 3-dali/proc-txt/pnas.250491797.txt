HslVU is an ATP-dependent prokaryotic protease complex. Despite
detailed crystal and molecular structure determinations of free
HslV and HslU, the mechanism of ATP-dependent peptide and
protein hydrolysis remained unclear, mainly because the productive complex of HslV and HslU could not be unambiguously
identified from the crystal data. In the crystalline complex, the I
domains of HslU interact with HslV. Observations based on electron microscopy data were interpreted in the light of the crystal
structure to indicate an alternative mode of association with the
intermediate domains away from HslV. By generation and analysis
of two dozen HslU mutants, we find that the amidolytic and
caseinolytic activities of HslVU are quite robust to mutations on
both alternative docking surfaces on HslU. In contrast, HslVU
activity against the maltose-binding protein-SulA fusion protein
depends on the presence of the I domain and is also sensitive to
mutations in the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of HslU.
Mutational studies around the hexameric pore of HslU seem to
show that it is involved in the recognition兾translocation of maltose-binding protein-SulA but not of chromogenic small substrates
and casein. ATP-binding site mutations, among other things, confirm the essential role of the ‘‘sensor arginine’’ (R393) and the
‘‘arginine finger’’ (R325) in the ATPase action of HslU and demonstrate an important role for E321. Additionally, we report a better
refined structure of the HslVU complex crystallized along with
resorufin-labeled casein.

B

acteria contain a number of ATP-dependent proteases,
including two component systems like the ClpAP, ClpXP,
and ClpQY (HslVU; ref. 1). ClpA and ClpX share a common
protease, ClpP. In contrast, HslU interacts only with HslV (2).
HslVU is of particular interest as a simple model system for the
eukaryotic 26S proteasome (3–5). Subunits of HslV share significant sequence (6) and structural similarity (7) with the
proteasomal ␤-subunits but form different oligomeric assemblies
with D6 symmetry of HslV and D7 symmetry of the archaeal
␤-subcomplex. HslU, a member of the Hsp100 family of
ATPases (8), exhibits both ATPase (3) and chaperone activities
(9). The structure determination of HslU showed that it exists as
a hexamer of subunits with three domains termed N-terminal
(N), intermediate (I), and C-terminal (C) domains, respectively
(10). The structure of the N and C domains classified HslU as
a member of the ATPases associated with a variety of cellular
activities (AAA)-ATPase superfamily of proteins as had been
suggested by sequence comparison (11). HslU is therefore a
useful model system for the base part of the proteasomal 19S
regulatory caps, which contain six components classified as
members of the AAA-ATPase family (12).
Despite abundant structural information about HslVU, the
mechanism of ATP hydrolysis and protease activation is still
unclear. In the x-ray structures of the HslU-ATP and HslU-5⬘adenylylimidotriphosphate (AMP-PNP) complexes (10), we found
an abundance of basic and acidic residues in the vicinity of the
scissile anhydride bond between ␤- and ␥-phosphates of the nucleotide. This is compatible with both base and acid catalysis of the
hydrolysis reaction. To distinguish between these possibilities, we
mutated residues near the nucleotide-binding site.

Additionally, and most importantly, different docking modes
are observed in the crystal structure and in electron microscopy
(EM) images (10, 13). In the crystal structure, HslU docks to
HslV with the I domains pointing toward the HslV particle (this
will be referred to as the x-ray mode of docking) (10). An
attractive feature of this docking mode is that no translocation
of substrate through the rather small central pore of the HslU
hexamer would be required. Instead, HslU could shuttle between states of high and low affinity for HslV and deliver
substrates in the process. In contrast, the EM images (13),
interpreted in the light of the crystal structures of both components, indicate binding of HslU to HslV with the I domains distal
to HslV (this will be referred to as the EM mode of docking).
Consistent with the weak binding of HslU to HslV, alternative
configurations of the complex may be stabilized by different
conditions of sample preparation (crystallization and staining,
respectively). Both models present problems for functional
interpretation. The crystal structure shows very weak contacts
between the components and small conformational changes
between free and complexed components. This is hard to
reconcile with the observation that HslU stimulates the activity
of HslV against small chromogenic substrates up to 100-fold. The
EM model does not show how substrates could be delivered to
the HslV through the narrow pore along the 6-fold axis of HslU.
To identify the functionally relevant HslVU docking mode, we
have designed and generated a gallery of mutants. Here, we
report the results of our extensive mutagenesis and biochemical
studies. We also report a better refined structure of the HslVU
complex crystallized in the presence of resorufin-labeled casein,
a substrate of the HslVU protease complex.
Materials and Methods
Cloning, Expression, and Purification. The isolation of wild-type

HslV (7) and HslU (10) has been described. Mutants were
generated by using standard PCR techniques and ligated into
pET12b or pET22b. These constructs were then transformed
into BL21(DE3) or BL21(DE3)[pLysS] cells for expression.
Wild-type HslV and HslU and the mutant enzymes were purified
as previously described (7, 10). Each mutagenesis was confirmed
by DNA sequencing as well as electron spray ionization mass

spectroscopic (ESI-MS) analyses. Maltose-binding protein and
SulA fusion protein (MBP-SulA) was overexpressed and purified
as described previously (14). The state of oligomerization was
estimated by gel filtration and comparison with the elution
profile of the wild-type protein in the absence of exogenous

Assays. ATPase activity was measured as described earlier (15),
by determining the amount of inorganic phosphate formed on
ATP hydrolysis and detected at 660 nm as a complex with
malachite green and ammonium molybdate.
Peptide hydrolysis was assayed by using the chromogenic
peptide, carbobenzoxy-Gly-Gly-Leu-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (Z-Gly-Gly-Leu-AMC; Bachem) as a substrate as reported
earlier (3) with 1 ␮g of HslV and 2.5 ␮g of HslU.
Resorufin-labeled casein (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)
(16) or FITC-labeled casein (17) was used as a model protein
substrate. The proteolytic activity of HslV (10 ␮g) in the
presence of HslU (25 ␮g) against resorufin-casein was assayed
following the manufacturer’s instructions. The degradation of
FITC-casein was measured by using HPLC. Enzyme samples
(15 ␮g of HslV; 37.5 ␮g of HslU) in buffer U (50 mM Tris䡠HCl,
pH 7.5/5 mM MgCl2) were incubated for 45 min with 2 mM
adenosine 5⬘-O-(3-thiotriphosphate; ATP-␥S) and 1 mM
FITC-casein. The reaction was stopped by the addition of
calpain inhibitor I (acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal) to a final concentration of 1 mM.
The MBP-SulA assay was carried out as reported earlier (14,
18) with minor modifications.
Crystallization and Refinement. HslV-HslU complexed with
resorufin-casein was crystallized as follows: 2 ␮l of an HslVHslU mixture prepared as previously described (10) was mixed
with 0.3 ␮l of 4 mg兾ml resorufin-labeled casein and 2.3 ␮l of
reservoir buffer, that contained 100 mM Mes, pH 6.5, and 1.95
M sodium acetate. Purple-colored crystals were grown in hanging drops by vapor diffusion at room temperature. They are
isomorphous to the complex crystals described previously (10).
Diffraction data were collected on a charge-coupled device
detector at the BW6 beamline of the Deutsche Elektronen
Synchroton Centre, Hamburg (Table 1). Data processing and
subsequent refinements were carried out as previously described
(10). Solvent molecules were added by using model-phased
difference Fourier maps by using CNS (19).

Results
Mutations of ATP-Binding Sites of HslU. In the HslU-ATP and

HslU-AMP-PNP complexes (10), the nucleotide is bound between adjacent subunits at the hinge region of the N and C
domains. We found the ␧-amino groups of K63 (part of the
Walker A motif) and K80 close to the ␥-phosphate of ATP (see
figure 4 in ref. 10). The latter’s involvement in catalysis would not
be expected from sequence comparisons between members of
the AAA-ATPases, because it is not conserved (11). Mutation
of this residue to threonine showed that amidolytic and caseinolytic activities were reduced by factors of 4 and 2, respectively.
Surprisingly, the ATPase activity and the rate of degradation of
the MBP-SulA fusion protein were unchanged (Table 2).
A prominent and conserved residue R325 from the adjacent
subunits, homologous to R315 in FtsH, is essential for activity in
FtsH (20). The R325E mutant exhibited a complete loss of all
protease and ATPase activities, but the crystal structure of the
mutant complex was nearly identical to the native complex (data
not shown). In particular, the mutant is still able to bind
nucleotide under crystallization conditions.
The adjacent subunit also contributes two acidic residues, E286
and E321, to the active site. In the HslVU structure, E321 is closer
to the ␥-phosphate, but E286 and not E321 appears to be conserved

among AAA-ATPases (11). The replacement of E286 with glutamine had no effect on ATPase activity, but the activities against
peptide, casein, and MBP-SulA substrates were reduced. The
analogous mutation in E321 had a more drastic effect: E321Q was
inactive in all assays, including the ATPase assay.
R393 of the C domain, a conserved residue of the AAAATPases (11), is part of the G⌽RX⌽ (⌽ hydrophobic) signature
sequence V of the Clp family (8). This ‘‘sensor arginine’’ is likely
to mediate the change in the relative orientation of the N and C
domains of HslU on nucleotide binding and release. Mutation of
this residue to alanine abolished both the ATPase and protease
activities.
Activity of HslVU Under Crystallization Conditions and Refined Model
of HslV-HslU. To examine the influence of the crystallization

conditions on enzymatic activity, we crystallized the complex in
the presence of resorufin-casein and investigated the effect of
this component in the crystallization mix. HslVU is expected to
be less active under our crystallization conditions than in the
presence of Mg2⫹, ATP, and low salt (10). We found that crystals
of the same space group and lattice constants could be grown
with an excess of magnesium and without exogenous ATP. They
were not pursued further because they diffracted less well.
Additionally, HslV-HslU complex crystals grown in the presence
of resorufin-labeled casein were purple in color because of
trapped fully兾partially digested colored substrate. The presence
of casein fragments in the washed crystals was confirmed by
SDS/PAGE analysis (data not shown). Further support for the
activity of the enzyme came from caseinolytic assays performed
under crystallization conditions. Also, crystals of the complex
grown in the presence of resorufin-casein by using an HslV
mutant that hydrolyzes casein very slowly had varying amounts
of fully兾partially digested colored substrate trapped in them
(data not shown). Crystals that appeared earlier were almost
colorless, whereas those that appeared later were colored to

varying extents. It is obvious that active enzyme species exist
under the conditions of crystallization.
HslVU crystals grown in the presence of resorufin-labeled
casein diffracted to the same resolution (2.8 Å) as the native
HslVU complex, but the quality of data was better (Table 1).
Although the resulting structure is almost identical to that of the
native HslVU complex, the electron density maps corresponding
to the I domain were somewhat better defined. On the basis of
these maps, we could model additional residues in this domain,
one of the six N-terminal histidine tags in the HslU molecule and
two C-terminal residues in HslV, which were not visible in the
previously reported structure (10). In addition, water molecules
could be added to the model by using these maps. Electron
density corresponding to casein or its digested fragments could
not be observed, probably because of random positions of the
digested fragments in the crystal.
Deletions in the I domain of HslU. The I domain protrudes from the

N domain with residue M110 and returns to it with residue A243
(ref. 10; Fig. 1 Left). It has a loosely folded coiled helical
structure, and large parts are disordered in our earlier structures
(10) and in the current refined model. In the crystal structures
of the complex, this domain is in contact with HslV.
To investigate the role of the I domain and especially its

involvement in the docking between HslU and HslV, we designed three different deletion mutants (⌬137–150, ⌬175–209,
⌬111–239) in this region of HslU (Table 2, and Fig. 1 Middle).
In the ⌬137–150 mutant, we deleted residues that appear to
mediate the interaction between HslU and HslV in the crystalline complex. As these and the adjacent residues in HslV are
more disordered in the structure of the complex than in the
structures of free HslV (7) and of HslU-AMP-PNP, we had
suggested that an order–disorder transition could play a role in
the mechanism of protease activation. The ⌬137–150 mutant
exhibits wild-type-like activities against small chromogenic peptides, casein, and MBP-SulA, ruling out an essential role of this
segment in complex formation.
In the ⌬175–209 mutant, we deleted a segment that is disordered in all three HslU crystal structures (10). This deletion
mutant exhibits the same behavior as the wild-type protein
toward Z-Gly-Gly-Leu-AMC and casein. However, unlike in the
case of the wild-type enzyme, no degradation of the MBP-SulA
fusion protein was observed.
The ⌬111–239 mutant, although lacking the entire I domain,
was still able to stimulate peptide and casein hydrolysis. However, this mutant did not degrade the MBP-SulA fusion protein.
Mutations of Putative Contact Regions in HslU in the EM-Docking
Mode. Next, we attempted to disrupt the surface of HslU that

would be in contact with HslV in the EM mode of docking. In

on the prominent positions on the surface of HslU and their
contribution to the electrostatic potential (Fig. 1 Right). As
charges on HslU and HslV appear to complement each other in

this docking mode (Fig. 2 Left and Center), we first converted
charged residues in HslU to neutral or oppositely charged
residues (D436K兾E437K, D436A兾E437A, E266Q, and E266Q兾

ity against only MBP-SulA. The other mutants exhibit wild-typelike activities against the small peptide, casein, and MBP-SulA
(Table 2).
To generate more drastic effects, we introduced pentaglycine
linkers at various positions on the surface of HslU (Table 2, and
Fig. 2 Right). These insertion mutants are Ins(265,266; pentaglycine residues between 265 and 266), Ins(311,312; pentaglycine
residues between 311 and 312), Ins(387,388; pentaglycine residues between 387 and 388), and Ins(436,437; pentaglycine
residues between 436 and 437). Despite these profound steric
alterations of the surface of HslU, the Ins(265,266) and
Ins(387,388) mutants behaved like the wild-type protein toward
peptide and casein but did not degrade the MBP-SulA fusion
protein (Table 2). The Ins(311,312) mutant had much lower
activities in all assays, including the ATPase assay, compared
with wild-type enzyme. Thus, we mutated isoleucine 312 to a
bulky residue, tryptophan. This mutant exhibited at least wildtype-like activities against all of the three substrates used in our
assays (Table 2).
The carboxy terminus of HslU, which is conserved among the
HslU family, is buried inside the C domain with its charge
balanced by R394 and R329 of the adjacent subunit. It seems to
be very important for the folding or oligomerization of HslU.
When we added some residues [Ins(436,437)] in this region or
deleted the C-terminal residues (⌬432–443), the mutants were
expressed in insoluble forms (Table 2).
Mutations of Hexamer Pore of HslU. Despite similar architectural

arrangements of HslVU and the core particle of the proteasome,
there is a large functional difference. Although HslV is activated
by HslU, the 20S particle consisting of the ␣ and ␤ rings is
activated by the 17-subunit regulatory particle of the 26S proteasome. Structural features of the 20S proteasome have suggested (21, 22) and mutational studies have shown (23) that the
unfolded substrate is threaded through the gate formed by the
Song et al.

␣ subunits. We therefore mutated the hexameric pore formed by
HslU to study its role.
The residues numbered 87–95, which form the hexamer pore
of HslU (Fig. 3), are highly conserved in all known HslU
sequences. This loop was ordered only in the trigonal complex
but disordered in the other two HslU structures (10). Y91 is
central in the pore (Fig. 3) and was mutated to glycine. The
Y91G mutant exhibited almost similar peptidase, protease (assayed against Z-Gly-Gly-Leu-AMC and FITC-casein) and
ATPase activities as the wild-type protein but did not degrade
MBP-SulA. The V92G mutant was similar to Y91G. Two
deletion mutants, ⌬88–92 and ⌬89–92, showed no activity and
much reduced activity in all assays, respectively (Table 2). E88
seems critical, as its substitution with a neutral residue in the
E88Q and E266Q兾E88Q mutants leads to reduced peptidase
activity. The activities against casein and SulA were much
reduced, although the ATPase activity was similar to that of the
wild-type enzyme.
In contrast to these mutants, which were designed largely to
widen the pore, we attempted to block the pore by introducing a
bulky tryptophan side chain at position 95 (E95W) and in another
instance (G93A) by reducing its flexibility. The E95W mutant
exhibited wild-type-like peptidase, caseinolytic, and ATPase activities, but its activity against MBP-SulA was much lower (Table 2).
The G93A mutant, on the other hand, exhibited much reduced
activities in all assays including ATPase activity (Table 2).
Discussion
In the presence of the nonhydrolyzable ATP-␥S, wild-type HslVU
degrades the chromogenic peptide and casein, but not MBP-SulA
(18). On the basis of these results, it has been suggested that only
ATP binding but not its hydrolysis is a prerequisite for peptidase
and caseinolytic activities, whereas ATP binding and hydrolysis are
necessary for MBP-SulA degradation.
As expected, we find that the ‘‘arginine finger’’ R325 and the
‘‘sensor arginine’’ R393 are required for all HslVU activities.

The crystal structure of the R325E mutant and preliminary
circular dichroism spectroscopic data of the R393A mutant
indicate that both proteins can still bind nucleotide. Failure of
the R325E and R393A mutants to degrade peptide can be
attributed to weaker intersubunit contacts. R325E fully and
R393A partially dissociates in gel filtration experiments in the
presence of salt.
In addition, we discovered an essential role for E321, a residue
that is close to the nucleotide in our structure but is not
conserved among AAA-family proteins (11). Lack of any hydrolytic activity in this mutant cannot be attributed to deficiencies in oligomerization. Further work is required to determine
whether the protein retains affinity for nucleotide.
The involvement of the other residues is less clear. Mutations
of K80 and E286 have differential effects on the different
activities, probably reflecting a more indirect role of these
residues in catalysis. We consistently find that mutations in the
vicinity of the nucleotide-binding site of HslU tend to have a
more drastic effect on peptide and casein hydrolysis than on
MBP-SulA degradation (Table 2). This is in stark contrast with
our mutagenesis results on the putative docking surfaces that
affect mostly MBP-SulA degradation and have little effect on
peptide and casein hydrolysis.
Deletion of the whole I domain abolished degradation of MBPSulA, but caseinolytic and peptidase activities were unaffected.
Deletion of the residues that mediate HslV–HslU interactions in
the crystal structure had no effect on any of the HslVU activities.
In contrast, deletion of the residues that are invisible in the crystal
structure had the same effect as a deletion of the full I domain.
These results suggest that the I domain and, in particular, residues
175–209, are involved in MBP-SulA recognition and兾or unfolding.
We had proposed earlier that the I domain might be involved in
substrate recognition and binding, although the defined parts of the
I domain of HslU show no detectable structural similarity with the
substrate-binding domains of other chaperones (24). A structural
comparison of the I domain with proteins in the DALI database
(25) indicated a notable structural similarity (Z score ⬎2.0) to a
domain of arginyl–tRNA synthetase, high mobility group I protein,
and RNA polymerase primary ␴-factor fragment. The significance
of this result is not clear because, unlike in those proteins, we could
not detect any affinity between HslU and DNA in gel shift assays.
To test the relevance of the EM-docking mode for the degradation of the various HslVU substrates, we initially mutated

charged residues on the surface of HslU. With the exception of the
charge reversal at the carboxy terminus, all these mutants behaved
like wild type. The same was true when we introduced a bulky
residue. To our surprise, even the introduction of 30 glycine residues
(5 per monomer) into the putative docking surface does not
interfere with peptidase and caseinolytic activities.
The hexameric pore of HslU occurs in a dish-shaped depression
of HslU (Fig. 3). It is unlikely that residues in the pore are involved
in direct HslV–HslU interaction, also because the docking surface
of HslV has a concave shape (Fig. 1). As a general trend, we find
that mutations in the hexameric pore have little effect on the
ATPase, peptidase, and caseinolytic activities. In contrast, they all
have drastic effects on MBP-SulA degradation. We conclude that
for this substrate, but not necessarily for casein, this region is
involved in substrate recognition and兾or translocation.
In summary, we conclude that peptidase and caseinolytic
activities are surprisingly robust to changes in both putative
docking surfaces of HslU. For these substrates, a precise complex between HslV and HslU may not be required, with HslU
acting as a substrate concentrator and delivery system to HslV.
In contrast, requirements for structural integrity of HslU are
much more stringent for the degradation of MBP-SulA, most
likely because of the extra unfolding step.
Our mutagenesis data suggest that different HslV-HslU complexes may be involved in the degradation of different substrates.
We speculate that the EM mode of docking may be relevant for
MBP-SulA degradation, whereas the x-ray mode of docking
seems to play a more important role for peptidase and caseinolytic activities.
Note Added in Proof. While this paper was in press, small angle x-ray
scattering data and a crystal structure of HslVU complex from Haemophilus influenzae were reported (29).
