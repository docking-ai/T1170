MuB is an ATP-dependent nonspeciﬁc DNA-binding protein that
regulates the activity of the MuA transposase and captures target
DNA for transposition. Mechanistic understanding of MuB function
has previously been hindered by MuB’s poor solubility. Here we
combine bioinformatic, mutagenic, biochemical, and electron microscopic analyses to unmask the structure and function of MuB. We
demonstrate that MuB is an ATPase associated with diverse cellular
activities (AAA+ ATPase) and forms ATP-dependent ﬁlaments with
or without DNA. We also identify critical residues for MuB’s ATPase,
DNA binding, protein polymerization, and MuA interaction activities. Using single-particle electron microscopy, we show that MuB
assembles into a helical ﬁlament, which binds the DNA in the axial
channel. The helical parameters of the MuB ﬁlament do not match
those of the coated DNA. Despite this protein–DNA symmetry mismatch, MuB does not deform the DNA duplex. These ﬁndings, together with the inﬂuence of MuB ﬁlament size on strand-transfer
efﬁciency, lead to a model in which MuB-imposed symmetry transiently deforms the DNA at the boundary of the MuB ﬁlament and
results in a bent DNA favored by MuA for transposition.

NA transposons are ubiquitous in the genomes of all forms
of life and play important evolutionary roles in generating
gene diversity and in shaping genomic landscapes (1). Although
typically transposons exhibit no strong sequence selectivity for
the target DNA site, certain transposons avoid self-destructive
insertion (reviewed in ref. 2), a phenomenon called “target immunity” because the presence of a copy of the transposon renders nearby DNA sites “immune” to additional insertion by the
same transposon (3–8). MuB plays critical roles in this selfimmunity in the bacteriophage Mu transposition process.
Phage Mu is one of the most complex and efﬁcient transposable
elements (reviewed in refs. 3 and 4). Two phage-coded proteins,
MuA and MuB, are essential for efﬁcient Mu transposition. MuA
is the transposase responsible for synapsing the two Mu end
sequences and for all of the DNA cutting and joining steps in the
initial stages of transposition. However, transposition is inefﬁcient
in the absence of MuB, and the residual Mu insertion that takes
place uses only DNA target sites near or within the transposing
element, often leading to self-destruction (9–11). MuB is a small
(35-kDa) ATP-dependent nonspeciﬁc DNA-binding protein with
relatively low ATPase activity (10, 12, 13). Upon ATP binding,
MuB polymerizes preferentially on DNA, but in the absence of
DNA it still can form polymers of variable sizes (14, 15). When
observed by total internal reﬂection ﬂuorescence microscopy,
GFP-MuB-ATP binds along the DNA molecule forming many
short separate segments of polymers, and, as more GFP-MuB is
added, the protein-covered segments elongate to form an apparently continuous polymer that fully coats the DNA. Hydrolysis of
ATP reverses this process, triggering disassembly of the MuB
polymer (16–18).

www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1309499110

The MuB–DNA complex controls MuA activity at several steps,
including stimulation of the strand-transfer reaction, which joins
Mu DNA ends to the target DNA site (19, 20), leading to utilization
of MuB-bound DNA as the preferred target for transposition (11).
MuB-stimulated transposition displays target immunity, avoiding
target sites near preexisting Mu-end sequences where MuA binds.
This is because MuA stimulates the ATPase activity of MuB, and
because this interaction takes place more frequently when the two
proteins are bound on the same DNA molecule relatively close to
each other, MuA triggers the dissociation of MuB from DNA sites
near the Mu ends more efﬁciently than from those sites at a distance (21). Thus, by the time MuA assembles the active complex
with synapsed Mu DNA ends ready to capture target DNA, MuB
has been depleted from the vicinity of the active complex and
accumulates on DNA sites away from the Mu-end sequence. This
explains the strong preference of the transposing Mu to target
DNA sites at substantial distances away (5–25 kb) from its original
site (22).
Beyond the mechanistic framework outlined above, study of
MuB function has been hampered by the lack of structural information. The 312-amino-acid MuB polypeptide can be divided
into two fragments by limited proteolysis (23). The N-terminal 25kDa fragment contains Walker A and Walker B motifs (24) and
also a putative helix-turn-helix motif (12), but it lacks ATPase
activity and is prone to aggregate. The C-terminal 10-kDa fragment consists of a four-helix bundle, whose structure was deSigniﬁcance
DNA transposons move from one genomic location to another
using a transposase. A regulatory protein might assist in target
selection and avoiding self-destruction. MuB is the regulatory
protein of Mu transposon. Here we report that MuB is an AAA+
(ATPase associated with diverse cellular activities) ATPase and
forms right-handed helical ﬁlaments around DNA. The helical
parameters of MuB and DNA are mismatched and their interactions are nonuniform. We propose that enhanced ATP
hydrolysis by MuB, induced by contacts with the MuAtransposon-end complex, leads to DNA deformation and
bending at the MuB ﬁlament end, thus creating a favored
target for transposition.

termined by NMR spectroscopy and reported to resemble the Nterminal domain of Escherichia coli replicative helicase DnaB (25)
(Fig. S1). Beyond this, no sequence similarity between MuB and
other proteins has been reported. Studies of mutant proteins have
been limited mostly to those involving the Walker motifs (26).
MuB’s tendency to aggregate in the presence of ATP hampered
efforts at structural characterization. Without such information, it
has not been clear how ATP controls MuB polymerization, what
kind of polymer MuB forms, how MuB polymer interacts with
DNA, or how MuA interacts with MuB polymer and triggers ATP
hydrolysis and DNA dissociation.
In this study we combine bioinformatic, mutagenic, biochemical, and electron microscopy (EM) techniques to characterize the
structure of MuB and its role in DNA binding and transposition.
First, we present evidence that MuB is a member of the AAA+
(ATPases Associated with diverse cellular Activities) ATPase superfamily. A large number of these proteins have been studied
structurally and functionally (27, 28). Guided by this ﬁnding, we
identiﬁed the critical residues that control MuB ATPase, DNA
substrate binding, and protein polymerization, yielding a clear picture of the communication between MuB and its interaction partners, MuA and DNA. Furthermore, we studied the structure of
MuB polymers by cryo-EM and image reconstruction. We demonstrate that MuB-ATP forms a solenoid-like ﬁlament (150 Å in
diameter with a pitch of 48 Å) and that DNA is bound in the axial
channel. The helical parameters of the MuB ﬁlament (5.4 subunits
and 48-Å per turn) do not match those of the B-form DNA (10 bp
and 36 Å per turn). However, despite this mismatched symmetry
between the protein and DNA, MuB does not signiﬁcantly distort
the bound DNA duplex. Therefore, individual MuB subunits in the
ﬁlament must interact with DNA nonuniformly.
Results
MuB Is Predicted to Be an AAA+ ATPase. We used the protein
structure prediction servers PHYRE (29) and HHpred (30) to
search for structural homologs of MuB. Notably, all of the proteins identiﬁed as having high similarity to MuB are members of
the AAA+ ATPase superfamily. Despite the rather limited sequence identities (8–17%), all of the alignments predicted MuB
residues 77–312 to have the same secondary and tertiary structures as the AAA+ proteins (Fig. 1A). Proteolytic cleavage was
observed between I231 and N232 that separates the two putative
domains of the AAA+ module in MuB (Fig. 1 A and B; Fig. S2A).
To test the MuB functional organization, we engineered a construct consisting only of the putative AAA+ module (MuB-ΔN;
residues 65–312) and another construct lacking the C-terminal
domain (MuB-ΔC; residues 1–231). Whereas MuB-ΔC lacks any
ATPase activity and has low expression and low solubility, MuB-ΔN
is soluble and stable and exhibits the ATPase activity at 50% of fulllength MuB (kobs = 3.2 min−1) (Fig. 2A). It is known that ATP hydrolysis is inhibited by DNA and is signiﬁcantly stimulated by MuA
in the presence of DNA (but not by a truncated form of MuA lacking
the C-terminal 48 residues, MuAtrun) (10, 14). We observed that the
activity of MuB-ΔN responds to the addition of MuA and DNA in
a similar manner as wild-type MuB (MuBwt) (Fig. 2 A–C). Consistently, MuB-ΔN stimulated the intermolecular transposition reaction and discriminated against “immune” target DNA in a cell-free
reaction system, similarly to MuBwt (Fig. 2D). We also produced
two MuB constructs covering residues 1–63 or 1–72, and preliminary
characterization indicated that this N-terminal appendage is a wellfolded helix-rich globular domain. These results conﬁrm that MuB
consists of an AAA+ module preceded by an independently folded
N-terminal domain, which can be removed without severely impeding ATP hydrolysis, MuA interaction, or DNA binding.

MuB, the importance of the Walker A and Walker B motifs
was demonstrated previously: mutations K106A (Walker A) and
E174Q or D176H (Walker B) strongly diminished ATPase activity
(26). Our similarity analysis predicts that MuB residues N202,
R268, and R224 are the sensor I, sensor II, and the arginine ﬁnger
(R ﬁnger), respectively (Fig. 1A). Mutations N202A and R224A
decreased the ATPase activity ∼60-fold compared with MuBwt,
whereas the activity of R268A was practically undetectable (Fig.
2A). Two other arginines, R187 and R220, were predicted to be at
the same protein interface as the R ﬁnger, and mutations of these
residues to alanine reduced the ATPase rate by 20- and 12-fold,
respectively. The signiﬁcance of these arginines is discussed below.
To distinguish between defects in ATP hydrolysis versus ATP
binding, we measured MuB–ATP/ADP complex formation by
a spin-column method (31, 32) (Fig. 2C). MuBwt formed a very
small amount of nucleotide-bound complex detectable by this
method, indicating that ATP dissociation is fast or, more likely,
that during the time needed to process the sample (∼1 min) ATP is
hydrolyzed (ATPase turnover is t1/2 = 19 s) and ADP dissociates.
Indeed, the nucleotide-bound fraction increased to ∼60% when
DNA was added to the mixture, reﬂecting ATPase inhibition by
DNA. Similarly, 20% of MuB-ΔN eluted from the column bound
to the nucleotide, likely due to its reduced ATPase rate, and the
nucleotide-bound fraction increased fourfold in the presence of
DNA. We expected to detect more nucleotide-bound protein for
mutants that bind, but could not hydrolyze ATP with this assay.
This was the case for N202A and R187A. In contrast, the nucleotidebound fraction of R220A, R224A, and R268A was less than 5%,
indicating impaired ATP binding. Interestingly, the addition of
DNA increased ATP binding especially for mutants with weak
ATP binding (Fig. 2C), suggesting cooperative stabilization of
ATP and DNA binding, leading to MuB polymer formation (see
below). Probably due to the improved binding of ATP, addition of
DNA enhances the ATPase rates of R187A and R220A (Fig. 2A).
A key element that is conserved in a large number of AAA+
proteins is a loop (loop 1) that protrudes from helix α2 and is involved in substrate (protein or DNA) recognition (Fig. 1 A and B).
In MuB, an eight-residue loop is predicted to protrude from the
middle of helix α2. We made the triple mutation R150A/R151G/
K152A and the double mutation R151A/K152A in this putative
loop. These mutants have ATPase activities ∼1.5- and 2-fold higher
than MuBwt, but importantly, the activity is unaffected by DNA
(Fig. 2A). The ATPase activity does not respond signiﬁcantly to
MuA either, indicating that MuB-DNA binding is required for
the ATPase to be stimulated by MuA (Fig. 2B). We examined the
contribution of each of the three residues to the higher activity
and/or to the recognition of DNA. R150A, R151A, and K152A
single mutants exhibited activities equal, 1.7-, and 2-fold higher than
MuBwt, respectively, but, unlike the multiple mutants, the activity
was inhibited by the addition of DNA, and K152A was stimulated
by MuA (Fig. 2 A and B). These results indicate that both R151 and
K152 are involved in the interaction with DNA. Consistent with
the above, the triple mutant failed to stimulate strand-transfer reaction, whereas the K152A mutant did not stimulate strand transfer
and discriminate against immune target (Fig. S2B).
Visualization of ATP-Induced MuB Filaments by EM. Many AAA+
proteins oligomerize into ring-like or helical assemblies with a
central pore that binds the substrate (27) (Fig. 1B). Because MuB
aggregates in the presence of ATP, we examined these aggregates
by EM. Negatively stained specimens containing MuB in the
presence of ATP revealed that MuB had polymerized into ﬁlaments (Fig. 3A). Polymerization was fast, with ﬁlaments readily
visible on grids prepared only a few seconds after mixing MuB and
ATP. The ﬁlaments had a uniform width of ∼150 Å and varied in
length, typically between 200 and 600 Å, and they exhibited a stainpenetrable axial lumen. Ring-shaped particles with a diameter of

Fig. 1. MuB is an AAA+ ATPase. (A) MuB is predicted to have two different segments: (i) an N-terminal appendage (in magenta) and (ii) an AAA+ module
composed of a central α/β-domain (in cyan and red) and a C-terminal helical bundle (in orange). The AAA+ module of MuB is aligned with the AAA+ modules
of NtrC1 ([Protein Data Bank (PDB) 1NY5], PsPF [PDB 2BJV], ZraR [PDB 1OJL], RFC [PDB 1SXJ], and DnaA [PDB 3R8F]). Predicted MuB secondary structural
elements match those observed in the structures of the aligned proteins. Conserved α-helixes (cylinders) and β-strands (arrows) are represented above the
sequences. AAA+ elements are shown with a yellow background. Residues in gray were not observed in the crystal structures. Underscored MuB residues were
mutated in this study. (B) Representation of the AAA+ fold exempliﬁed by the heptameric ring and subunit structure of NtrC1 bound to ADP (PDB 1NY6). The
detailed view of the active site shows the ADP interacting with characteristic AAA+ elements. For illustrative purposes, the ATP γ-phosphate, the Mg2+ ion,
and the R ﬁnger are represented as semitransparent in a simulated position.

150 Å and a hollow center were also seen, which we think represent
axial views of short ﬁlaments.
Filament formation was not detected without ATP nor with
ADP. However, similar ﬁlaments were observed in the presence of
ATPγS, conﬁrming that ATP binding but not hydrolysis is needed for MuB to polymerize (14). Consistently, the mutant N202A,
which can bind but not hydrolyze ATP, forms ﬁlaments like those of
MuBwt (Fig. S3). On the other hand, with the ATP bindingdefective mutants (R268A, R220A, and R224A), polymerization
Mizuno et al.

was strongly impaired, and we observed only the ring-shaped particles. One exception was mutant R187A, which despite its capacity
to bind ATP did not form regular ﬁlaments, suggesting that R187
may contribute to stabilizing the MuB polymerization interface.
MuB-ΔC did not form ﬁlaments under any conditions tested. In
contrast, MuB-ΔN formed ﬁlaments upon ATP addition in a similar manner to MuBwt (Fig. S3), thus proving that the N-terminal
appendage is dispensable for this function and that an intact AAA+
module is necessary and sufﬁcient for polymerization.
PNAS | Published online June 17, 2013 | E2443

The N-terminal appendage seems dispensable for DNA interaction because Mu-ΔN polymerizes on DNA as MuBwt does
(Fig. S3A). On the other hand, mutants with impaired ATP
binding (R220A, R224A, and R268A) are also able to polymerize
on DNA (Fig. S3B), indicating that DNA acts as a scaffold that
facilitates ATP binding and protein polymerization. We also observed that the ﬁlaments made by the active site mutants responded to MuA stimulation, although the ATPase activity remained
low (Fig. 2B, Inset).
In agreement with the lack of effect by DNA on the ATPase
activities of the loop 1 triple and double mutant, the length of the
ﬁlaments formed by these proteins did not change upon addition
of DNA, indicating that they do not bind DNA (Fig. 3E and Fig.
S3B). In contrast, the loop 1 single mutants did assemble into
longer ﬁlaments on DNA (Fig. S3B).

MuB Filaments Are Right-Handed Solenoids with a 48-Å Pitch. Next,
MuB-ATP ﬁlaments were vitriﬁed and imaged by cryo-EM (Fig.
4). Power spectra of relatively straight ﬁlament segments showed
a strong layer line, indicative of helical symmetry, at an axial
spacing of (48 Å)−1 (Fig. S4A). Based on the off-meridional
positions of these reﬂections, the layer line was calculated to
correspond to a single-start helix; i.e., the ﬁlament is a solenoid.
The handedness of the ﬁlaments was determined using unidirectionally metal-shadowed specimens (Fig. S4B). Filament segments that were optimally oriented relative to the shadowing
direction consistently exhibited sets of right-handed striations. This
observation was conﬁrmed by the presence of a clear one-sided
layer line at (48 Å)−1 in averaged power spectra from these images
(Fig. S4B, Inset).

Nucleotide-binding assay by centrifugal gel ﬁltration. (D) Strand-transfer
stimulation activity of MuBwt and MuB-ΔN. Strand-transfer products (STP)
made in reactions that contained both immune (I) and nonimmune (NI)
targets and either ATP or ATPγS were examined. Presence of both STP-I and
STP-NI in the reaction with ATP, as in reactions in the presence of ATPγS,
indicates strand-transfer stimulation without discrimination against immune
target. Presence of STP-NI but no (or much less) STP-I in the reaction with
ATP indicates strand-transfer stimulation with discrimination against immune
target. Also see SI Materials and Methods for additional mutants tested.

DNA Stimulates MuB Filament Assembly. ATP-induced MuB ﬁlaments are longer in the presence of DNA than without DNA
[hereafter named DNA(+) and DNA(−) ﬁlaments] (Fig. 3). The
median length of the DNA(+) ﬁlaments matched the length of
the B-form DNA molecules (Fig. 3D). Immediately after mixing
DNA and MuB in the presence of ATP, short tracts of MuB
ﬁlament could be seen distributed at irregular intervals along the
DNA molecules (Fig. 3B, Inset), indicating that assembly had
initiated at multiple sites. Later in the reaction, fully coated molecules were observed but interrupted with discontinuities, suggesting that the various segments of the MuB ﬁlament had met but
not annealed (Fig. 3C). The ﬁlament morphology, other than the
length, did not change when DNA was included, suggesting that
DNA is inside the ﬁlament. In the course of trials, we also found
that, by increasing the salt concentration from 0.15 to 0.3 M,
MuB-ATP polymerization became DNA-dependent; only long
DNA-bound ﬁlaments were observed (Fig. 3C). This allowed us
to speciﬁcally prepare DNA(+) MuB ﬁlaments.

Classiﬁcation and 3D Reconstruction of MuB Filaments. The images
of vitriﬁed MuB ﬁlaments were dissected into short segments and
subjected to reference-free classiﬁcation, followed by averaging
of the classes thus identiﬁed (Fig. 4 and Fig. S5). Comparison
between class averages of DNA(+) and DNA(−) ﬁlaments did not
show clear additional density for the DNA. As discussed below,
this is most likely because the DNA density is blurred out upon
averaging.
Three-dimensional reconstructions were carried out using the
iterative helical real space reconstruction (IHRSR) method (33)
(Fig. S5). The reconstructed model shows a solenoid with an axial
channel 35–40 Å across; however, discrete subunits were not
clearly deﬁned along the solenoid. To reﬁne the analysis, we calculated many reconstructions from subsets of data deemed by the
classiﬁcation procedure to be relatively homogeneous (Materials
and Methods). These reconstructions all had similar helical symmetries (a 66.2°–67.0° twist and a 8.9- to 9.2-Å rise per asymmetric
unit), with ∼5.4 subunits per turn. Some of these reconstructions
showed repeating units well (Fig. 5) and were investigated further
(see below).
DNA(+) ﬁlaments were reconstructed in a similar way. Once
again, a global reconstruction yielded poorly deﬁned subunits
but classiﬁcation identiﬁed consistent subsets of data whose
reconstruction revealed discrete subunits. The reconstruction
with the most sharply deﬁned features showed a small density,
protruding into the axial channel (Figs. 5 and 6). This may correspond to a DNA-interacting motif of MuB.
In an effort to localize the N domain, we recorded images of
MuB-ΔN ﬁlaments for comparison with ﬁlaments of MuBwt
(Fig. 4B and SI Materials and Methods). The reconstructed model
of the MuB-ΔN DNA(+) ﬁlaments was similar to that of MuBwt.
We did not detect discrete density that could be assigned to the
N domain. The DNA(−) ﬁlaments were shorter, and we were
unable to perform informative reconstructions of them. The results
indicate that the N domain is ﬂexibly attached to the AAA+
module. A similar situation has been described for the AAA+
protein unfoldase, ClpA (34, 35).

Length of DNA(−) (gray; in 150 mM KCl) and DNA(+) ﬁlaments (black; in 300 mM KCl). The distribution of the ﬁlament lengths agrees with the expected sizes
of the DNA fragments: 0.34 kb (∼1,200 Å), 1.5 kb (∼5,100 Å), 1.7 kb (∼5,800 Å), and 1.8 kb (∼6,100 Å). (E) The ﬁlaments of the MuB R150A/R151G/K152A
mutant have the same length when adding DNA, indicating that loop 1 is key for DNA recognition. (Scale bars, 500 Å.)

The three reconstructions all have resolutions of about 18 Å
(Fig. S5C) to which they are limited apparently by disorder. They
differ primarily in the near-axial region (Fig. 5). MuBwt DNA(−)
has a prominent axial density that we suggest is contributed by N
domains detached from the wall, at least in this subset of ﬁlament segments. This axial density is missing in the other two
reconstructions, but on them the density lining the inner surface of the axial channel extends further inward. We suggest
that this additional density represents the DNA, although the
density is diluted by the randomized averaging process. The N
domain might be partly contributing to this density, or it could
be displaced from an axial location by the DNA to disordered
positions outside.
Molecular Docking of an AAA+ Module. The foregoing account
assigns the structural units resolved along the strand of the solenoid, mostly if not completely, to the AAA+ module of MuB. We
therefore attempted to ﬁt the crystal structure of the AAA+
module of NtrC1 into this density. The numerous crystal structures of different AAA+ modules are sufﬁciently conserved to
suggest that this surrogate should be adequate for docking at the
present resolution. We performed a rigid-body ﬁtting to helical
units from the reconstructions. The AAA+ module was found to
ﬁt quite well into the cryo-EM density (Fig. 6). This modeling
experiment implies that the quasi-globular unit of density repeated along the strand consists of the α/β-domain of one subunit
and the C-terminal domain of the adjacent subunit. One of the
Mizuno et al.

reconstructions of MuBwt with DNA nicely accommodates the
density of loop 1 facing the axial channel.
Mutations in the Linker Abolish MuA Stimulation. The proteolytic Cterminal fragment of MuB was previously proposed to bind DNA
nonspeciﬁcally and to interact with MuA through a patch of three
lysines, K233, K235, and K236 (25, 36). We recognized the Cterminal fragment as an integral part of the AAA+ module, which
is connected to the α/β-domain by a linker that harbors the three
lysines. Because the C-terminal domain and the linker invariably
locate at the periphery of the AAA+ assemblies, and in the MuB
ﬁlament reconstructions they do not face the internal ﬁlament
channel where DNA binds, we reexamined the role of these lysines
in DNA recognition. The MuB K233A/K235A/K236A mutant can
polymerize on the DNA and its ATPase activity is inhibited by
the addition of DNA (Fig. 2A and Fig. S3B). Therefore, we concluded that these lysines are not involved in DNA recognition.
Interestingly, other AAA+ members (e.g., NtrC1) also present
a linker with positively charged residues that undergoes conformational changes associated with the ATPase cycle (37). Thus, an
attractive possibility is that the ATPase cycle could be controlled
by conformational changes at this linker region. The fact that the
triple linker mutant, like the loop 1 mutants, enhances ATPase
activity supports this notion (Fig. 2A). Because the ATPase activity
of the K233A/K235A/K236A mutant and the DNA-bound ﬁlaments do not respond to MuA and fail to stimulate strand-transfer

interact with MuA to trigger ATP hydrolysis.

the increase of MuB concentration in agreement with the necessity
of MuB oligomerization for DNA binding (Fig. S7A). At moderately higher MuB concentrations, the reaction efﬁciency increased roughly linearly with MuB concentration, producing one
transposition product per ∼50–100 MuB monomers. The higher
the density of MuB on DNA, the more efﬁciently the MuB-bound
DNA fragment was used as a target. However, when DNA was
completely saturated by bound MuB, it suddenly became a poor
strand-transfer target, and only 20% of the DNA was used for
transposition (Fig. S7B). The inhibition of transposition by saturating MuB concentration was more severe when ATP was
substituted by ATPγS (Fig. S7C). Thus, a rather large MuB ﬁlament on the DNA, perhaps involving several turns or larger, is
needed to promote each strand-transfer event, but DNA inside the
MuB ﬁlament cannot be used as a target, and the actual target site
would have to be on the outside of the ﬁlament. Thus, either naked
DNA adjacent to a MuB ﬁlament must be available or the MuAMu DNA end complex must generate a MuB-free zone by activating the MuB ATPase activity.
Discussion
Architecture and Domain Functions of the MuB AAA+ ATPase. The

AAA+ superfamily is characterized by a two-domain ATPase
module that typically oligomerizes into ring-like or helical assemblies. Additional regulatory domains may be added at the N terminus (as in MuB) or at another site. The identiﬁcation of the AAA+
module of MuB (amino acids 70–312), based on sequence align-

MuB Filament Does Not Alter DNA Structure or Topology. The fact
that the length of the MuB-DNA ﬁlaments matches the length of
DNA fragments in the absence of protein (Fig. 3D; also see ref. 17)
indicates that MuB binding does not signiﬁcantly alter the DNA
length. Next we tested whether the linking number of relaxed
circular DNA changes when bound by MuB. Nicked circular
pBR322 DNA was converted to a closed circular form in the
presence of different concentrations of MuB and ATP, deproteinized, and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis in the presence
of chloroquine to examine the topoisomer distribution (Fig. S6A).
The topoisomer distribution broadened in the presence of higher
concentrations of MuB, suggesting increased torsional ﬂexibility
within the MuB ﬁlament. This is unlikely to be caused by increased
bending ﬂexibility, considering that the MuB-coated ﬁlament
appeared stiffer than naked DNA by EM. The center of topoisomer distribution shifted toward reduced linking numbers as
more MuB was added to the DNA solution. Combined with the
information from the binding titration experiments (see below),
we estimate that DNA within MuB-bound ﬁlament is only ∼1.2%
under-wound compared with the relaxed B-form DNA. Therefore,
the DNA conformation within the MuB ﬁlament appears to be
close to the B-form structure.
To measure the MuB saturation density on DNA in solution,
we titrated MuB onto ﬂuorescence-labeled DNA and monitored
the extent of MuB-DNA association by ﬂuorescence quenching.
Based on the titration curve obtained, we estimated that, at the
saturation point, each MuB subunit covers ∼2.75 bp of the DNA
(see details in Fig. S6B). This stoichiometry corresponds to 9.3 Å
per MuB monomer, which agrees well with the axial rise per
MuB monomer in the EM image reconstruction.
Patch Size of MuB-DNA Filament Needed for Transposition Stimulation.

The typical size of individual MuB-coated segments along DNA
depends on the protein and DNA concentrations and their stoichiometry. To assess the size of the MuB/DNA ﬁlament needed to
activate the strand-transfer step of transposition, we asked how the
MuB concentration or stoichiometry with DNA affects the efﬁciency of transposition. At MuB concentrations below 10 nM, the
target DNA strand-transfer efﬁciency was sigmoidal in response to

ment and mutagenesis, led to identiﬁcation of many functionally
important residues. Helical ﬁlaments assembled from MuB-ATP,
visualized by EM, further support the assignment of MuB as an
AAA+ family member. Previously, the division of MuB into two
fragments by limited proteolysis led to difﬁculties in assigning
functions to the respective fragments. We demonstrated that the
N-terminal ∼70 amino acids of MuB constitute an independently
folded appendage, loosely attached to the AAA+ ATPase core.
This appendage appears to play a relatively minor role in the
known biochemical activities of MuB. Further study will be
needed to clarify its function.
The 3D structure of the C-terminal domain, which was obtained
by denaturation and refolding and determined by NMR under
high-salt conditions, clearly differs from the conserved fold of the
AAA+ C-terminal domain (reviewed in ref. 38) (Fig. S1). Thus,
the C-terminal domain of MuB might fold in a different conﬁguration when isolated on its own, compared with its structure
within the context of the intact protein.
Identiﬁcation of Residues Critical for MuB Filament Formation. We
have identiﬁed characteristic AAA+ functional elements on MuB:
sensor I, sensor II, and R ﬁnger. Mutation of these residues
strongly affects ATP binding/hydrolysis. Sensor I is typically involved in the coordination of the Mg2+ and the attacking water.
We assigned N202 to be the sensor I of MuB. As predicted, the
Mizuno et al.

Residues Critical for DNA Binding. Identiﬁcation of the DNA-binding

motif in MuB was guided by sequence alignment with the enhancerbinding proteins NtrC1, PsPF, and ZraR. These proteins have
a conserved sequence in loop 1 that is important for interaction
with the σ-subunit of RNA polymerase (39). When assembled into
rings, loop 1 of each protomer points to the central pore where
the σ-subunit binds. Similarly, we hypothesized that the sequence
140
PRRKGP154, at the predicted loop 1 in MuB, could face the
inner channel and interact with DNA. Results obtained with the
double and triple loop 1 mutants support this idea because their
ATPase activity is not inhibited by the addition of DNA and the
ﬁlaments fail to assemble on the DNA. Synergistic effects of two
mutations, R151A and K152A, are needed to eliminate DNA
recognition because point mutations do not abolish DNA binding.
Interestingly, mutations in loop 1 increase the ATPase approximately twofold. It is known that the addition of DNA lowers
the apparent Kd for ATP and slows down ATP hydrolysis. This
implies that loop 1 DNA binding allosterically controls the

mutation N202A strongly impairs ATP hydrolysis, seemingly
without affecting ATP binding or ﬁlament formation.
Sensor II is typically an arginine whose side chain extends from
the C-terminal domain toward the β- and γ-phosphates of ATP,
contributing to ATP binding and hydrolysis. We propose that
R268 is the sensor II of MuB. When mutated to alanine, ATP
binding is impaired and so is the ATPase activity, and no ﬁlament
formation takes place. The fact that this mutation has the lowest
ATPase activity of all of the mutants studied here is intriguing
because mutating sensor II in other AAA+ proteins causes only
a modest decrease in ATPase activity or has no effect on oligomerization (reviewed in ref. 28). This suggests that the C-terminal
domain of MuB might be ﬂexible and that R268 plays a key role
in coupling the ATP binding to locking the C-terminal domain in a
conformation that favors protein–protein interactions and ﬁlament
assembly.
The R ﬁnger projects from a conserved position on helix α4 and
interacts with the γ-phosphate of the ATP bound to the neighboring subunit. Thus, ATP glues adjacent subunits together, favoring and, in some cases, as in MuB, triggering polymerization.
In most AAA+ proteins, mutation of the R ﬁnger typically impairs ATP hydrolysis and can affect oligomerization. We propose
that R224 plays the role of R ﬁnger in MuB, and, indeed, the
mutation R224A severely impairs ATP binding and ﬁlament
formation. However, AAA+ members typically have other arginine residues located on the same surface as the R ﬁnger that also
point toward the active site in the neighboring subunit. We mutated two additional arginines in MuB, which were predicted to be
on the same protein surface as the R ﬁnger. R220 occupies an
equivalent position to an extra arginine in helix α4 of DnaA that
projects parallel to the R ﬁnger and forms a salt bridge with sensor
I in the adjacent subunit. The mutation R220A in MuB impairs
ATP binding and ﬁlament formation. On the other hand, R187
aligns with an arginine that in RFC directly interacts with the
γ-phosphate of ATP. In agreement with this, MuB R187A can
bind but not hydrolyze ATP. The R187A mutant is also compromised in ﬁlament formation, which in this case cannot be
assigned to a defect in nucleotide binding. Thus, we propose that an
electrostatic interaction between R187 and the ATP γ-phosphate
may contribute to stabilizing this protein interface. Oligomerization of other AAA+ members has been shown to be sensitive to
salt concentration, indicating the importance of electrostatic interactions. Likewise, MuB ﬁlament formation is salt concentrationsensitive. We propose that these three arginines cooperate in
stabilizing the polymerization interface in the presence of ATP.
Single-mutant proteins, although compromised, can still form
ﬁlaments on DNA, which can interact with MuA and activate the
target DNA for strand transfer in the presence of ATPγS, albeit
very weakly (Fig. S2B).

ATPase active site for tighter ATP binding and slower hydrolysis.
The structures of NtrC1, PsPF, and ZraR free or bound to
different nucleotides have revealed a nucleotide-dependent
movement of loop 1 that might control the interaction with the
σ-subunit (37). A similar mechanism in MuB would explain why
mutations in loop 1 could uncouple DNA recognition and the
ATPase cycle, allowing faster hydrolysis. Stabilization of the ATPbound state with hydrolysis inhibition by DNA binding would
place the DNA-bound MuB ATPase under stringent control of
MuA, which would trigger ATP hydrolysis by contacting the MuBDNA ﬁlament from the outside. This also suggests that ATP
hydrolysis would return the loop 1 conﬁguration to a low DNAafﬁnity state and, combined with weakened contacts between
monomers due to the loss of the ATP γ-phosphate, could contribute
to rapid disassembly of the MuB ﬁlament upon MuA interaction.

Symmetry Mismatch in the MuB Nucleoprotein Filament. MuB coats
the DNA without signiﬁcantly altering its B-form structure. Thus,

the helical parameters of the MuB ﬁlament do not match those of
the DNA within the ﬁlament (Fig. 7A and Fig. S4C). This symmetry mismatch is a feature that, to our knowledge, has not been
previously observed in other nucleoprotein ﬁlaments. Commonly,
protein ﬁlaments that contain DNA either adopt a helical symmetry close to that of the standard B-form DNA or impose their
symmetry on the DNA, inducing deformations. Well-known examples are the RecA family of ATPases, which assemble into
helical ﬁlaments on DNA and catalyze homologous DNA pairing
and strand exchange. Each monomer binds three nucleotides while
extending and untwisting the DNA between the triplets, causing
an overall stretching of the DNA molecule (40). Another example
is the bacterial DnaA protein, an AAA+ member that assembles
into right-handed helices and induces the deformation of DNA
in a way similar to the RecA mechanism (41). However, not all
nucleoprotein ﬁlaments induce DNA deformation. RFC is a complex of ﬁve different AAA+ subunits that forms right-handed spirals with roughly the same pitch as B-form DNA, without causing

Fig. 7. Model for MuB targeting DNA for transposition. (A) The helical parameters of the MuB ﬁlament (represented as beads on a string) do not match
those of B-form DNA. This results in a nucleoprotein complex with a symmetry mismatch (B). Matching symmetry between MuB and DNA would require the
DNA to be under-wound and extended, which may occur at the boundary of the MuB ﬁlament with the help of MuA and possibly ATP hydrolysis. Deformed
and bent DNA is a preferred target for transposition catalyzed by MuA. (C) A summary of interplay among MuA, MuB, and DNA during transposition. Upon
ATP binding, MuB forms helical ﬁlaments on DNA. MuA bound to Mu DNA ends stimulates ATP hydrolysis by MuB and MuB dissociation from DNA, which
generates MuB-free DNA regions. Reciprocally, MuB stimulates MuA to pair and nick Mu DNA ends at the junction with the ﬂanking sequences. MuA and
MuB together may induce the matching symmetry between MuB and DNA at the boundary of a MuB ﬁlament and thus DNA distortion, which leads to the
target DNA capture and Mu transposition.

Materials and Methods
Proteins. MuB was expressed with N-terminal His-tag cleavable either by

and ﬂanking primers, as listed in Table S1, and the ampliﬁed fragment with
the coding sequence for the mutant protein was inserted into a pOPIN-B
vector with In-Fusion. The expression and puriﬁcation of the mutants was
performed as for MuBwt.
ATPase Activity Assays. ATPase assays were carried out as described (18).
Reactions contained 1.7 μM MuB (or higher concentrations for the mutants),
25 mM Tris·HCl (pH 8), 0.15 M NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 20% (vol/vol) glycerol, 1
mM DTT, 0.1 mg/mL BSA, and 1 mM [α-32P]ATP (4 mCi/μmol). At different
time points, 10 μL aliquots were combined with 1.1 μL of 0.5 M EDTA to stop
the reaction. Reaction products were separated on polyethyleneimine
TLC plates in 0.75 M KH2PO4 and quantiﬁed using a phosphoimager (Typhoon Trio–GE Healthcare) and ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare).
Data were analyzed with Prism 4.0. The inhibitory effect of DNA on the
ATPase activity was assayed by adding 1.7 μM of a 36-mer doublestranded DNA. The effects of MuA and MuAtrun on the ATPase activity
were measured at ﬁnal protein concentrations of 0.45 μM MuB and 6 μM
MuA in the presence of 10 μg/mL pMK589 DNA, which carries a pair of Mu
end sequences in wrong orientation (15), and with reaction buffer containing an additional 42 mM KCl.
Nucleotide-Binding Assay. Centrifugal gel ﬁltration (spin-column) assay was
carried out essentially as described (31, 32). Fifty-microliter samples of 30 μM
MuB in 20 mM Tris·HCl (pH 8), 0.3 M NaCl, 10% (vol/vol) glycerol, and 5 mM
MgCl2 were incubated with 1 mM [α-32P]ATP for 0.5 min, applied to tuberculin syringes ﬁlled with 1-mL SephadexG-50 (ﬁne) equilibrated in the same
buffer, and immediately centrifuged. The unbound nucleotide was retained
on the column, and the protein-bound nucleotide in the efﬂuent was
quantiﬁed using a scintillation counter. Protein recovery in the column
efﬂuent was measured by the Bradford method (48). The same DNA used in
ATPase activity assays was included at a ﬁnal concentration of 5 μM to test
the effect on nucleotide binding.
Strand-Transfer Immunity Assay. Mu strand-transfer reaction was carried out
in two steps. The mini-Mu DNA-MuA complex was assembled in a 25-μL
reaction containing 20 μg/mL mini-Mu plasmid DNA (pMK586), 110 nM HU,
and 200 nM MuA in 25 mM Hepes (pH 7.6), 1 mM DTT, 100 μg/mL of BSA,
15% (vol/vol) glycerol, 10 mM MgCl2, and 160 mM NaCl at 30 °C for 10 min.
The target DNA-MuB complex was assembled in a 12.5-μL reaction containing 30 μg/mL ϕX-RF DNA (nonimmune target), 20 μg/mL pMK589 (immune
target containing both Mu end sequences in wrong relative orientation),
500 nM MuA, 500 nM MuB, and 1 mM ATP or ATPγS in the same buffer as
above at 30 °C for 30 min. 5-μL of the donor complex and 5-μL of the target
complex were combined and incubated for another 20 min. The reaction was
stopped by the addition of 20 μg/mL of Proteinase K and incubation at 50 °C
for 30 min. The reaction products were analyzed with 0.8% high gelling
temperature (HGT) agarose gel electrophoresis.
EM Data Acquisition and Image Processing. For EM specimen preparation, MuB
was diluted to 0.07 mg/mL (2 μM) in 30 mM Tris·HCl (pH 8.0), 0.15 M KCl,
5 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM DTT and incubated with 1 mM ATP or ATPγS. After
an incubation time between several seconds to 5 min, samples were applied
to EM grids. To assemble MuB ﬁlaments on DNA, we used a pGEX-6p plasmid with a 1.58-kb fragment inserted between the BamHI and XhoI sites and
digested with BamHI, XhoI, AlwNI, and EcoRV (New England Biolabs) to
generate four linear DNA fragments of ∼0.3, 1.5, 1.7, and 1.8 kb. Alternatively, gel-puriﬁed PCR product of ∼1 kb was used. To selectively obtain MuB
ﬁlaments on the DNA, the salt concentration in the buffer was increased to
0.3 M. For negative staining, 5 μL of the sample was applied to a glow-discharged carbon-coated copper grid, washed with ﬁve drops of dionized
water, and stained with two drops of 1% uranyl acetate. The grids were
viewed at room temperature with a FEI CM120 electron microscope equipped with a LaB6 ﬁlament and operated at 120 kV. For cryo-EM experiments,
5-μL droplets were applied to Quantifoil holey carbon grids (EMS). A Vitroboot cryo-station (FEI) was used to vitrify the specimen. Imaging was performed with a CM200-FEG electron microscope (FEI) operating at 120 kV.
Micrographs were recorded on a 2k × 2k CCD camera (Gatan) with a defocus
range of 1.5–3 μm at a nominal magniﬁcation of 38,000, corresponding to
2.8 Å per pixel.
Image analysis was carried out using SPIDER (49), EMAN (50), XMIPP (51,
52), and Bsoft (53). The contrast transfer function was corrected by phaseﬂipping. Filament images were segmented with a box size of 120/80 pixels
and 90% overlap of adjacent segments. Totals of 9,717 and 8,342 boxes
were selected for MuB in the absence and presence of DNA, respectively,
corresponding to ∼36,000 and ∼31,000 asymmetric particles.

BIOCHEMISTRY

apparent deformations (42). An interesting example is ParA2, a
bacterial protein involved in plasmid segregation, which forms
left-handed helical ﬁlaments on DNA without signiﬁcantly changing the B-form DNA helicity (43). Unlike RFC, ParA2 ﬁlaments
do not match the DNA helical parameters, but the arrangement of
the helix is dictated by the repetitive interaction of the protein every
8 bp in the DNA, resulting in two different but complementary
helices (notably, members of ParA family have been shown to bind
DNA distributively as small oligomers, such as MuB, rather than as
long ﬁlaments when the stoichiometry is low) (44).
The MuB-DNA symmetry mismatch means that the protein–
DNA contacts vary from point to point along the ﬁlament (Fig.
7B). This lack of regularity in MuB-DNA interactions might be
a contributing factor for the relatively weak cooperativity in MuB
polymerization along DNA, resulting in many short segments of
MuB-coated patches at subsaturating MuB concentrations. Weak
binding cooperativity would be advantageous so that MuB can be
efﬁciently redistributed by MuA-coupled ATP hydrolysis for
transposition immunity.
Another possible consequence of this irregular association with
DNA is that not all MuB subunits have loop 1 in the same conformation, and thus the ATPase rate might vary among them. One
might ask if the stimulation of MuB ATPase by MuA could be
transmitted to the DNA-binding loop, changing its conformation
and inducing local changes of the DNA structure. In fact, the most
efﬁcient stimulation of MuB ATPase requires a tetramer of MuA
molecules bound to the Mu DNA ends, which suggests that multiple nearby MuB monomers might be activated simultaneously.
Could this impose local symmetry matching and DNA deformation, which in turn might help utilization of this DNA segment
as the strand-transfer substrate for MuA (Fig. 7B)? Although MuA
lacks sequence speciﬁcity, it is known to display a great preference
for insertion in mismatch sites on the DNA (45). There is no
physiological reason for such preference other than that the mismatch DNA would readily assume a deformed DNA structure,
which is favored for the strand-transfer reaction. Indeed, the target DNA segment is severely bent within the structure of the Mu
strand-transfer complex (46). Because MuB forms a tightly packed
outer shell, the DNA inside the ﬁlament would be inaccessible for
MuA strand transfer. Indeed, MuB-saturated DNA is a poor target for Mu transposition. Thus, probably, the DNA selected for
Mu insertion is not encased within the ﬁlament, but it is at the MuB
ﬁlament boundaries. Then, the hypothetical DNA deformation
discussed above perhaps takes place when MuB disassembly is
triggered by the MuA–Mu end complex, ready for strand transfer
(Fig. 7C).
Short helical MuB ﬁlaments might be too unstable on DNA
and need a minimum of several helical turns to avoid premature
dissociation for productive interaction with the MuA-Mu end
complex for strand-transfer activation. Perhaps there is an optimal polymer size distribution for function; the MuB architecture described here is well tuned toward this and also to respond
efﬁciently to its interaction with MuA at different stages of the
transposition reaction.
What we found in this study has a broader implication for the
understanding of the intricate control that AAA+ ATPases
could impose in complex reaction systems through their structural components that couple multiple binding partner interactions to the ATPase activity.

For helical parameter determination, the initial helical symmetry was
estimated using Fourier transform of MuB ﬁlament images. Brieﬂy, a basic
layer line (48 Å)−1 located at n = 1 (basic helix) and then the secondary layer
lines at (83 Å)−1 were determined to obtain the helical lattice. This layer line
was not always ﬁxed at one position, indicative of ﬁlament ﬂexibility. IHRSR
(33) combined with SPIDER was used for helical symmetrization. The helical
parameters were veriﬁed by matching the power spectrum of the reprojections
of the reconstructions and the averaged power spectrum from raw images.
Reference-free classiﬁcation, using K-means clustering and principal component analysis, and averaging were performed using EMAN and SPIDER.
Individual populations that belong to each class were grouped, and 3D
reconstructions for each group were calculated using IHRSR. Reconstructions
showing helices with well-deﬁned subunits were further grouped by clus-

tering them according to similar helical parameters, and reconstructions were
performed for these classes.
