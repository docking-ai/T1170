alous data in cross-phased difference Fourier maps showed the
space group to be P43212 rather than its enantiomorph.
Refined heavy-atom parameters were employed to compute multiple isomorphous replacement phases to 3.0-A
resolution. The mean figure of merit, including anomalous
scattering data, was 0.62 to 3.0-A resolution. The electron
density map calculated with these phases could be interpreted for about 75% of the molecule. Cycles of model
building, refinement (12), and phase combination served to
improve the map. The current map is consistent with the
derived amino acid sequence of BirA (6) and the chemical
nature of the heavy-atom substitutions. The model (Fig. 1)
has an R factor of 19.0% against all observed data between 20and 2.3-A resolution, with root-mean-square deviation from
ideal bond lengths and bond angles of 0.013 A and 2.40,
respectively. It includes 287 of the 321 amino acids in the
repressor sequence (see below) and 44 bound solvent molecules. The distribution of 4 and 4i angles is shown in Fig. 2.¶
Description of the Structure
Domain I. The BirA monomer has approximate dimensions
of 75 A x 35 A x 30 A and is organized in three domains (Fig.
1 Left). The N-terminal domain (residues 1-60) consists of
three a-helices [A (residues 4-15), B (22-29), and C (33-46)]
packed against two strands of antiparallel 3-sheet [1 (49-54)
and 2 (56-60)]. Sequence comparisons with members of the
DNA-binding helix-turn-helix family suggested that residues
22-46 of BirA constituted a helix-turn-helix motif (13). The
structure determination confirms that a-helices B and C
correspond to the helix-turn-helix motif. The a-carbon atoms of residues 22-42 of BirA superimpose on a-carbons
16-36 of Cro protein from phage A (14) with root-mean-square
discrepancy of 0.91 A. The discrepancy between residues
22-42 of BirA with residues 169-189 of the catabolite gene
activator protein (15) is 0.67 A. These values correspond well
with the agreement between other known helix-turn-helix
motifs (16, 17). The tenuous coupling of the DNA-binding
domain to the rest of the protein suggests that large-scale
conformational changes could easily occur both in solution
and on binding DNA.
Domain II. The topology of the central domain of BirA (Fig.
1 Left) appears to be novel. A comparison with proteins in the
Brookhaven Data Bank using the method of Subbarao and
Haneef (18) revealed no corresponding structural fold. The
domain consists of five a-helices [D (residues 68-76), E
(89-97), F (147-164), G (234-256), and H (259-269)] and a
mixed P-sheet consisting of seven strands [3 (80-84), 4 (104-

The three-dimensional structure of BirA, the
ABSTRACT
repressor of the Escherichia col biotin biosynthetic operon, has
been determined by x-ray crystallography and refined to a
crystallographic residual of 19.0% at 2.3-A resolution. BirA is
a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein that also catalyzes the
formation of biotinyl-5'-adenylate from biotin and ATP and
transfers the biotin moiety to other proteins. The level of biotin
biosynthetic enzymes in the cell is controlled by the amount of
biotinyl-5'-adenylate, which is the BirA corepressor. The structure provides an example of a transcription factor that is also an
enzyme. The structure ofBirA is highly asymmetric and consists
of three domains. The N-terminal domain is mostly a-helical,
contains a helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif, and is loosely
connected to the remainder of the molecule. The central domain
consists of a seven-stranded mixed 13-sheet with a-helices covering one face. The other side of the sheet is largely solventexposed and contains the active site. The C-terminal domain
comprises a six-stranded, antiparallel 13-sheet sandwich. The
location of biotin binding is consistent with mutations that affect
enzymatic activity. A nearby loop has a sequence that has been
associated with phosphate binding in other proteins. It is inferred that ATP binds in this region, adjacent to the biotin. It is
proposed that the binding of corepressor to monomeric BirA
may promote DNA binding by facilitating the formation of a
multimeric BirA-corepressor-DNA complex. The structural
details of this complex remain an open question, however.

The biotin operon repressor, BirA, is a 33.5-kDa protein that
regulates transcription of the Escherichia coli biotin operon
(1-3). BirA is bifunctional, serving both as the biotin (vitamin
H)-activating enzyme and as a transcriptional regulator. It
catalyzes the formation of biotinyl-5'-adenylate from biotin
and ATP and transfers biotin to a specific lysine residue on
the biotin carboxyl carrier protein, a subunit of acetyl-CoA
carboxylase (4, 5). If all the biotin-accepting proteins in the
cell have been biotinylated, the BirA-biotinyl-5'-AMP complex accumulates and binds to the 40-base-pair bio operator,
repressing transcription of the biotin biosynthetic genes (4,
6-8). Thus BirA synthesizes its own corepressor, a unique
property among known DNA-binding proteins. BirA represses transcription when biotinyl-5'-AMP is bound to the
enzyme, suggesting that binding of corepressor helps form
the BirA-DNA complex.

Domain II contains four loops, which appear to be mobile
or unstructured and cannot be visualized in electron density
maps. These loops occur in pairs in the three-dimensional
structure (Fig. 1 Left). One disordered loop (residues 116124) contains the sequence GRGRRG, previously identified

as a consensus sequence (GXGXXG) associated with ATP
binding (19, 20). In the nearby unstructured region (residues
212-223), limited proteolysis has revealed a subtilisinsensitive bond that is partially protected from cleavage in the
presence of corepressor (Dorothy Beckett, personal communication). This also suggests that this region of the protein is
at or close to the site of binding of corepressor.

Exposure of BirA crystals to biotin or corepressor resulted in
severe cracking and crystal destruction. This suggests that a
conformational change accompanies corepressor binding.
Because BirA transfers biotin to a specific lysine residue of
biotin carboxyl carrier protein, attempts were also made to
soak crystals of BirA with biotinylated lysine, and these
proved to be successful in locating the biotin binding site (Fig.
3 Top). Coordinates of the complex were refined to a crystallographic residual of 17.3% at 2.8-A resolution. Average
deviations in bond lengths and angles from ideal values were
0.015 A and 2.70, respectively.
Biotin occupies a portion of the 13-sheet face that is exposed
to solvent in domain II, and makes contacts with parts of
three 13-strands (strands 5, 8, and 9), the N terminus of helix
E, and main-chain atoms of residues 114-118 (Fig. 1 Left).
Residues 116-118 are disordered in the apoprotein. Upon
biotin binding they become localized and partially bury the
biotin. The biotin binding pocket has hydrophobic sides with
a more hydrophilic center. The biotin carbonyl and ureido
nitrogens interact via hydrogen bonding with the hydrophilic
interior of the cavity, while the hydrophobic tail and
thiophene ring interact with the hydrophobic sides of the
pocket. The thiophene ring contacts glycine residues 186,
204, and 206 (Fig. 3 Middle and Bottom). An absence of side
chains at these three positions permits the thiophene ring to
sit on a hydrophobic, relatively flat binding site. The bound
biotin is less enclosed and appears to have less hydrophobic
interaction with surrounding protein than is the case in the
very tight complex of biotin with streptavidin (21, 22).
Specificity is derived from several hydrogen bonds between the biotin and the protein (Fig. 3 Middle). Particularly
striking are the hydrogen bonds from the amide nitrogen of
Arg-116 to the carbonyl oxygen of the biotin molecule, and
from the carbonyl oxygen of Arg-116 to one of the biotin
ureido nitrogens. In this instance the hydrogen bond donors
and acceptors on the biotin participate in hydrogen bonds
with the protein that are characteristic of 1-sheet structure.
There is also a hydrogen bond between the biotin carbonyl
oxygen and the side-chain oxygen of Ser-89. The remaining
ureido nitrogen participates in bidentate hydrogen bonds with
the side-chain oxygen atoms of Thr-90 and Gln-112. The
carboxyl group at the end of the hydrocarbon tail hydrogen
bonds to the amino group of Lys-183. Upon biotin binding

No direct crystallographic evidence for the ATP binding site
has been obtained to date. Several lines of evidence, however, suggest that ATP will bind adjacent to the biotin. (i)
ATP and biotin must be spatially close to permit the formation of biotinyl-5'-adenylate from biotin and ATP. (ii) Biotin
binding orders the N-terminal portion of the presumed phosphate-binding loop. (iii) Mutations that affect enzymatic
activity map to the region of the biotin binding site.
Correlation with Mutant Data
Mutants of the biotin repressor have been used to identify
regions of the protein that are presumed to be involved in
DNA binding, enzymatic activity, and/or protein dimerization (4, 6, 13). A subset of these is summarized in Table 2. In
most cases knowledge of the three-dimensional structure
permits rationalization of the observed phenotype. At the
same time, the location of the mutation sites helps confirm
the interpretation of the electron density map.
Regions of BirA likely to interact with DNA are suggested
by mutants that inactivate repressor function but have little
effect on enzymatic activity (13). Such mutations are restricted to three adjacent residues, amino acids 32-34 (Table
2), which had been predicted on the basis of sequence
homology to occur in a helix-turn-helix motif (13). The
three-dimensional structure shows that these three amino
acids are located within the first turn of the recognition helix
(Fig. 1 Left). The substitutions are =40 A away from the
biotin binding site, consistent with the observation that they
have little effect on enzymatic activity. The remaining amino
acid substitutions in Table 2 that are defective in repression
(residues 118, 119, 142, and 197) are located at least 20 A
away from the DNA recognition helix. These mutations could
disrupt direct communication between the corepressor binding site and the DNA-binding domain, or they might have a
more indirect effect such as interference with protein dimerization that accompanies DNA binding (see below).
Mutations that affect the enzymatic activity of BirA occur
at residues 107, 115, and 189 (Table 2), which are within 10
A of the crystallographically determined biotin binding site
(Fig. 1 Left). The side chain of Cys-107 is buried in the
three-dimensional structure with its sulfur atom in van der
Waals contact (3.9 A) with the y-methyl group of Thr-90. The
-oxygen of Thr-90 in turn makes a hydrogen bond to the
biotin. The Cys-107 -- Gly substitution could disrupt this
bond. Gly-115 is adjacent to the residues that become ordered
upon biotin binding. The side chain of a non-glycine at
residue 115 would protrude directly into the biotin binding
site. Replacing Val-189 with glycine could affect the formation of the salt bridge between Glu-190 and Arg-116 that
accompanies biotin binding.
Mutations in BirA that prevent growth at elevated temperatures presumably destabilize the protein. These mutations
are located at positions 83, 142, 207, and 235, which are
distributed throughout the three-dimensional structure.
Val-83 is completely shielded from solvent. Its replacement
with glycine would be expected to decrease hydrophobic and
van der Waals interactions. Ile-207 is completely buried in the
three-dimensional structure. Its replacement with serine presumably would place a hydrophilic amino acid within the
protein core and so reduce stability. Arg-235 is involved in a
solvent-inaccessible ion pair with Glu-110 and its replacement with cysteine would disrupt this salt bridge.

Repression by BirA

Many helix-turn-helix DNA-binding proteins are dimeric
and bind to their operators with twofold-related recognition
helices occupying successive major grooves of the DNA
(e.g., refs. 14 and 23-27). There are, however, several
indications that BirA may not follow this pattern. First, the
operator site for BirA is extended, encompassing 40 or so
base pairs (4, 7, 8, 28). Also, experiments using analytical gel
filtration chromatography and equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation indicate that BirA remains monomeric in 50
mM Tris CI/200 mM KCI/2.5 mM MgCl2 at pH 7.5 and 200C
at concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 30 1LM (Dorothy
Beckett, personal communication). These concentrations are
well above those at which specific binding to the biotin

operator occurs. In the crystal structure, two adjacent monomers of BirA are in contact and are related by a twofold axis
of symmetry (Fig. 1 Right). Because the area of contact is
1100 A2, substantially less than the 160 A2 of buried surface
area expected for dimeric proteins with subunit molecular
masses in the 24- to 40-kDa range (29), the crystal contact
may not represent a dimer contact in solution. While partial
complementation of different birA alleles has been taken to
suggest that a multimeric form may be involved in repression
(4), none of the known complementation sites occurs at the
crystal contact described above.
One way to at least partially integrate the data available at
the present time is to assume that BirA oligomerizes as it
binds to DNA. It was recently demonstrated that binding of
BirA monomers to DNA is cooperative (Dorothy Beckett,

personal communication). Precedent for the oligomerization
of a protein as it binds to DNA is provided by several
examples (30, 31). In the case of BirA it would be assumed
that the binding of corepressor favors formation of a dimeric
or possibly multimeric complex of BirA on the operator. In
such a complex the substitutions that complement one another (Table 2) might be spatially adjacent.
A second model involves restructuring upon ligand binding. In this case the formation of biotinyl-5'-adenylate on the
catalytic domain would change the relative positions of the
structural domains and would enhance affinity of monomeric
BirA for DNA in some unspecified manner.
It is difficult, however, to predict the exact mode of
alignment of BirA on DNA and so to differentiate between
these and other possible models. Although the helix-turnhelix unit is usually well conserved in different helix-turnhelix DNA-binding proteins, the mode of interaction with
DNA can vary substantially (23-27). The DNA can also bend
to a greater or lesser degree (23-26). In the present case the
apparent flexibility of the DNA-binding domain relative to
the rest of the protein adds another uncertainty. A full
understanding of the regulation of the biotin operon will
require the crystal structure of the BirA-corepressor-DNA
complex.
