The proteasome is the major engine of protein degradation in all
eukaryotic cells. At the heart of this machine is a heterohexameric
ring of AAA (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities)
proteins that unfolds ubiquitylated target proteins that are concurrently translocated into a proteolytic chamber and degraded
into peptides. Using cryoelectron microscopy, we determined a
near–atomic-resolution structure of the 2.5-MDa human proteasome in its ground state, as well as subnanometer-resolution structures of the holoenzyme in three alternative conformational states.
The substrate-unfolding AAA-ATPase channel is narrowed by 10 inwardfacing pore loops arranged into two helices that run in parallel with
each other, one hydrophobic in character and the other highly
charged. The gate of the core particle was unexpectedly found closed
in the ground state and open in only one of the alternative states.
Coordinated, stepwise conformational changes of the regulatory particle couple ATP hydrolysis to substrate translocation and regulate
gating of the core particle, leading to processive degradation.
ubiquitin-proteasome system

High-resolution structures of the isolated CP have been
available for several species (5, 12, 13). The intact proteasome
has not been resolved to a level at which a reliable Cα-backbone
can be traced with spatial assignment of amino acids, although
major advances have been made in recent years (2, 3, 7–11, 14–
25). Several RP subunits have been resolved at high resolution by
X-ray crystallography (14–16, 18, 21–24). Recent cryoelectron
microscopy (cryo-EM) analysis of the complete proteasome at
moderate resolution (6 to 10 Å) revealed an overall subunit
organization of the RP (7–10, 25–28). The lid subcomplex, which
consists of nine Rpn proteins (Rpn3, Rpn5 to Rpn9, Rpn11,
Rpn12, and Dss1/Sem1), exhibits a horseshoe-like architecture
and is organized around an elaborate bundle assembled from the
C-terminal helices of each subunit but Dss1/Sem1 (20, 29). The
six Rpt subunits of the base share a general domain organization,

The proteasome holoenzyme is an ATP-dependent protease in
eukaryotes that degrades ubiquitylated substrates. It is involved in numerous important biological processes, such as cell
division, differentiation, innate immunity, adaptive immunity,
regulation of gene expression, and response to proteotoxic
stress. Using cryoelectron microscopy, we have examined
multiple conformational states of the human proteasome at
medium to high resolution. Our results reveal that the substrate-conducting channel in the core particle is transiently
opened and accompanied by dynamic changes in structure of
the particle. These observations provide new insights into how
the proteasome recognizes ubiquitylated substrates and translocates them through a channel and gate to degradation sites
in the core particle.

T

he amount of each protein in the cell depends on its rates of
synthesis and degradation. In eukaryotic cells, selective protein degradation is mostly carried out by a set of pathways of
ubiquitylation that terminate in a 2.5-MDa protein proteolytic
complex, called the 26S proteasome. The ubiquitin-proteasome
pathways are essential parts of important biological processes,
such as cell division, differentiation, innate immunity, adaptive
immunity, regulation of gene expression, and the response to
proteotoxic stress (1–4). The proteasome is also an important
therapeutic target in multiple myeloma (5, 6).
The proteasome is composed of a 28-subunit barrel-shaped
core particle (CP) in the center capped at the top and bottom by
19-subunit regulatory particles (RPs) (SI Appendix, Fig. S1) (7–10).
The CP forming the catalytic chamber contains three proteolytically
active threonine residues. Heptameric α-rings, positioned on each
side of the catalytic chamber, control substrate entry into this space.
Opening of a channel within the α-ring is thought to result from
association of the RP and the CP (5, 11–13). However, the
mechanism of the core regulatory step of the proteasome channel
opening remains mysterious.
The RP is formed from two subcomplexes known as the lid and
the base. Recognition of a substrate with the requisite number and
configuration of ubiquitin is mediated principally by the base subunit Rpn13 and by another receptor, Rpn10 (4). To allow substrate
degradation, ubiquitin is first removed by Rpn11, a metalloprotease
subunit in the lid. The globular domains of a substrate are then
unfolded mechanically by a ring-like heterohexameric complex
consisting of six distinct subunits, Rpt1 to Rpt6, which belong to
the ATPases-associated-with-diverse-cellular-activities (AAA)
family. Both Rpn11-dependent deubiquitylation of the substrate
and unfolding of substrate globular domains require prior engagement with the translocation machinery.

starting with a coiled-coil (CC) domain at the N terminus, followed by an oligonucleotide- and oligosaccharide-binding (OB)
domain and an AAA domain toward the C terminus (7, 23). The
yeast proteasome holoenzyme was previously observed to assume three distinct conformations, hypothetically considered the
substrate-accepting (s1), commitment (s2), and translocating (s3)
states (25–28). The limited resolution, however, precludes understanding of the critical molecular mechanisms underlying
ATP-dependent degradation by the proteasome holoenzyme. The
nucleotide-binding states of AAA-ATPases, architecture of the
peptide-unfolding channel, and allosteric regulation of the substrate-translocation pathway remain particularly elusive.
We report here structures of the human proteasome in four
conformational states by single-particle cryo-EM. These structures offer atomic-level details of key intersubcomplex interfaces
in the human proteasome assembly. A detailed dissection of the
AAA-ATPase channel provides key insights into the molecular
mechanism of ATP-dependent, processive substrate translocation.
Importantly, the four conformational states reveal dynamic gating
of the CP channel, which is elegantly regulated through highly coordinated conformational changes among distinct subcomplexes.

(Fig. 1 A and B and SI Appendix, Fig. S2 A and B). We reconstructed the complete, doubly capped proteasome complex after
imposing C2 symmetry using 237,083 single-particle images.
The CP component was refined to a nominal resolution of 3.6 Å
(Fig. 1B and SI Appendix, Fig. S2C), whereas the resolutions of
its two RPs were significantly lower than that of the CP in this
map, suggesting that the RPs fluctuate conformationally (SI
Appendix, Fig. S2F). Maximum likelihood-based classification
identified a dataset of 85,420 particles of improved structural homogeneity, which improved the reconstruction of AAA-ATPase
to around 4-Å resolution (SI Appendix, Fig. S2 C and D). However, the lid subcomplex still demonstrates significantly lower resolution, suggesting it is the most flexible component in the
proteasome holoenzyme.
To investigate the conformational dynamics, we boxed half of
the holoenzyme, including half of the CP, in complex with a
complete RP (hereafter referred to as the RP–CP subcomplex)
using additional cryo-EM data (Fig. 1C and SI Appendix, Figs. S2
and S3). We conducted iterative maximum likelihood-based classification focusing on the RP structure by using single-particle images of the RP–CP subcomplex with the CP density subtracted (31,
32) (SI Appendix, Fig. S3 and Materials and Methods). After exhaustive computational purification, we obtained structurally
homogeneous datasets of the RP–CP subcomplex corresponding
to four distinct conformational states, namely a major state (SA)
and three alternative states (SB, SC, and SD) (Fig. 1 D–G and
SI Appendix, Fig. S3). We refined the overall RP–CP reconstructions of the SA, SB, SC, and SD states to nominal resolutions
of 4.4, 6.8, 8.0, and 8.0 Å, respectively (SI Appendix, Fig. S2E).
The high-resolution features of the doubly capped proteasome
map are consistent with those of the RP–CP map in the SA state.
In both maps, the ATPase subunits are better-resolved than the
lid subcomplex (SI Appendix, Fig. S2 F and G). The ATPase
density is best-resolved in the doubly capped map in the SA state,
whereas the lid subcomplex is best-resolved in the RP–CP map in
SA at a nominal resolution of 4.9 Å (SI Appendix, Fig. S2C). The
cryo-EM maps of the SA state enabled atomic modeling and
refinement (Fig. 1H and SI Appendix, Figs. S4–S7 and Table S1).
The final atomic model of the SA state contains all lid and CP
subunits, Rpn2, Rpn10, and Rpt1 to Rpt6 (Fig. 1D). The local
resolution of Rpn1 in SA is about 8 Å, which nonetheless suffices to build its pseudoatomic model. Based on the atomic
model of the SA state, we built pseudoatomic models for SB, SC,
and SD (Fig. 1 E–G). As expected, the ubiquitin-interacting motif
of the ubiquitin receptor Rpn10 is disordered and missing in
the cryo-EM densities of all conformational states (17, 19). The
other ubiquitin receptor, Rpn13, was not observed (SI Appendix,
Fig. S1).

Overview of Conformational States of the Human Proteasome. The
individual SA, SB, SC, and SD conformational states are represented in the particle populations at 76.2%, 10.1%, 5.8%, and
7.9%, respectively. The lid is rotated ∼40° clockwise in the SB
state relative to the SA state but rotated ∼5° counterclockwise in
SC relative to SB and translated ∼10 Å in SD relative to SC (Fig. 2
A–D). The AAA-ATPase heterohexamer movements on the
α-ring in the SC and SD states exhibit stepwise axial rotation,
lateral translation, and vertical rocking, which reduces the tilt of
the ATPase ring relative to the α-ring (Fig. 2 E–L).
The structures of the CP in the SA, SB, and SC states are
identical up to their measured resolution. The crystal structure of
free human CP with a closed CP channel can be fitted into the
cryo-EM maps of these states as a rigid body, including the
channel-blocking amino-terminal tails of the α-subunits (5) (Fig.
2 M and N and SI Appendix, Fig. S4 J–M). However, there is
considerable structural change in the α-subunits of the SD state,
where the CP channel is open (Fig. 2 O and P and SI Appendix,
Fig. S4M). A closed channel in the intact holoenzyme structure is
unexpected (33), and suggests that association of the RP and CP
subcomplexes does not open the CP channel by default in the SA
state of the human proteasome. Channel opening in the SD state

is accompanied by coordinated conformational changes in the
RP (Fig. 2 A–L).
Although multiple conformational states of the yeast proteasome
were reported in previous studies (25–28), no human counterparts
to these states have been observed before. Comparison between our
human holoenzyme in four states and the yeast ones in three
states (s1, s2, and s3) suggests considerable structural difference
in both the lid and the base (SI Appendix, Fig. S8). However, the
SA and SB states of the human holoenzyme generally correspond
to the s1 and s2 states of the yeast holoenzyme (28) based on the
general features of the Rpn11–OB and RC–CP interfaces (SI
Appendix, Fig. S9D). In the human SA and yeast s1 states, Rpn11
is positioned above the Rpt4–Rpt5 interface on the OB ring
without blocking the substrate entry port (7, 9, 25, 28). By contrast, Rpn11 is moved over the center of the substrate entry port
in both human SB and yeast s2 states (28). In the human SC/SD
states, there is prominent translation of the ATPase ring with
respect to the CP, a feature shared with the yeast substrateengaged and s3 states (26, 27).
The Lid–Base Interfaces. The lid–base interface plays a critical role
in coordinating substrate translocation with deubiquitylation (7–
10, 26, 28). In the SA state, the interface between the ATPase
Chen et al.

ring and lid buries ∼3,900 Å2 of interfacial area. Most of these
interfaces are contributed by Rpt3 and Rpt6, whose CC–OB
domains bury ∼3,100 Å2 of interface area with the lid (SI Appendix,
Fig. S9A and Table S2). The CC domain of the Rpt3–Rpt6 heterodimer is encircled by the helical elements of Rpn2, Rpn3, Rpn8,
and Rpn11 (SI Appendix, Fig. S9A) (7, 25, 27). This interfacial architecture constitutes the stabilizing core of the lid–base association
and is largely invariant in all four conformational states. Using this
interface as a pivot, Rpn11 rotates 30° to a position closer to the OB
ring of AAA-ATPase in the SB, SC, and SD states (SI Appendix, Fig.
S9 D–G).
The lateral lid–base interface exhibits prominent conformational transitions. The AAA domains of Rpt3 and Rpt6 bury
∼1,800 Å2 of interface area with Rpn5 to Rpn7 in the SA state
(SI Appendix, Fig. S9B and Table S2). One side of the aminoterminal PCI (proteasome-cyclosome-initiation factor) domain
of Rpn7, involving four helix-connecting loops, makes extensive interaction (∼940 Å2) with the Rpt6 AAA domain. This
interface is translated clockwise for ∼10 Å in SB relative to SA,
and remains nearly invariant in SC and SD. The AAA domains of
Rpt3 and Rpt6 make limited contact with Rpn5 and Rpn6, with
only ∼340 and ∼480 Å2 buried in the SA state, respectively. Consistent with the small interface area, the cryo-EM densities of the
Rpn5/Rpn6 amino-terminal PCI domain are substantially weakened
in the SB state, implying local dissociation between Rpn and Rpt
subunits at these interfaces. In the SD state, the Rpn5–Rpt3 interface is reestablished. This analysis suggests that the Rpn7–Rpt6
interface may be retained during conformational changes of the lid,
whereas the smaller interfaces of Rpn5–Rpt3 and Rpn6–Rpt6 are
labile (25–27).
The AAA-ATPase Heterohexamer. ATP binds the Walker A motif
located next to a short linker between the small and large AAA
subdomains of the ATPases. The nucleotide-binding state regulates the conformations of the Rpt subunits by modifying the
geometric relationship between the small and large AAA subdomains (27, 34, 35). In the density map of the SA state, we
identified nucleotide densities in all Rpt subunits (Fig. 3A). We
tentatively modeled six ATPs into the atomic structure of the SA
state. However, a caveat is noted. Because cryo-EM density is
built from averaging many single-particle images of individual
molecular copies, it does not sufficiently differentiate potential
coexistence of ADP and ATP in certain Rpt subunits in different
copies of single particles. Further work to establish the nucleotide composition in different states is needed.
The AAA domains of Rpt1 to Rpt6 form a staircase beneath
the OB ring, with Rpt3 located at the top position, Rpt2 at the
bottom, and Rpt6 bridging the two in the SA state (7–10)
(SI Appendix, Figs. S10 and S11A). The large AAA subdomain
contacts both the large and small AAA subdomains of the

The Substrate-Translocation Pathway. The substrate-translocation
channel in the center of the ATPase ring is mainly shaped by
inward-facing pore loops (23, 36, 37). Each ATPase contains four
pore loops, two on the OB domain and two on the AAA domain
(Fig. 4). The right-handed helical architecture in the AAA channel
gives rise to a constriction much narrower than the OB channel
(Fig. 4 E and F). The interior of the AAA channel is largely negatively charged. By contrast, the interior of the OB channel is
positively charged (SI Appendix, Fig. S11C). Both channels are
dramatically enriched for tyrosine residues. The OB channel has six
tyrosine residues (Tyr147 in Rpt1, Tyr72 and Tyr121 in Rpt6,
Tyr111 in Rpt3, Tyr79 in Rpt4, and Tyr158 in Rpt5), with their
oxygen atoms pointed toward the substrate-translocation pathway
(Fig. 4E). The AAA channel has five tyrosine residues from Rpt1 to
Rpt4 (Fig. 4E and SI Appendix, Fig. S13).
In the SA state, pore-1 loops from Rpt3, Rpt4, Rpt5, Rpt1, and
Rpt2 constitute a helical inner surface. These loops feature the
conserved hydrophobic [Tyr/Phe]-[Val/Leu/Ile]-Gly sequence
pattern that has been previously suggested to drive substrate
translocation in many ATP-dependent unfoldases such as HslU,
ClpX, ClpA, LonA, FtsH, and PAN (37, 38) (Fig. 4 C and E and SI
Appendix, Figs. S13 A and B and S14). The pore-2 loops constitute a
second helical inner surface running parallel to the pore-1 loops
(Fig. 4 B and D). Note that these pore loops directly extend from
the Walker B motif, which is involved in ATP hydrolysis (39).
Unlike the hydrophobic pore-1 loops, the pore-2 loops are heavily
populated with conserved, charged residues (seven glutamates and
two aspartates) (Fig. 4E and SI Appendix, Fig. S13C).
The AAA channel in the SA state has three narrow constrictions, defined by the axial area of overlap between the two poreloop helices (Fig. 4E, Inset). In this region, Tyr207 and Ile208
from Rpt4, Phe260 and Ile261 from Rpt5, and Tyr249 and
Val250 from Rpt1, all pore-1 loop residues, are paired with
neighboring charged residues in the pore-2 loops of Rpt3, Rpt4,
and Rpt5, respectively (Fig. 4 E and F). Interestingly, the phenotypic effects of pore-loop mutations are similar for the two
members of each pore-loop pair. Thus, for the pore-1 loop, Rpt4
has the strongest phenotype, whereas for the pore-2 loop the
partner Rpt3 has the strongest phenotype among the paired
loops (36). Also, the strength of the phenotype diminishes with
distance along the pore axis. As a result of pore-loop pairing, the
channel radius is constricted to as little as ∼2 Å (Fig. 4F). Among
the pore loops, Rpt6 is uniquely displaced from the channel axis

neighboring subunit, forming an L-shaped intersubunit interface
with a dihedral angle of about 120° (SI Appendix, Fig. S11B). The
interfacial area between the two neighboring large AAA subdomains varies from 0.96 to 1.45 times that between the large
and small AAA subdomains (SI Appendix, Fig. S11 D and E).
The buried interface (∼1,100 Å2) between the AAA domains of
Rpt3 and Rpt6 is half of the interfacial area between the other
two adjacent Rpt subunits in SA, suggesting that the former interface may be capable of greater structural rearrangement (26)
(SI Appendix, Figs. S11D and S12). Indeed, Rpt3 demonstrates
the greatest shift and rotation compared with other Rpt subunits
during state transitions from SA to SC (SI Appendix, Fig. S12 and
Table S3). In summary, the six AAA-ATPases are not arranged
symmetrically; rather, a strong asymmetry in the intersubunit
interfacial stability is a hallmark of the proteasomal AAAATPase heterohexamer (36).
During transitions from SA to any of the alternative states, the
OB ring behaves as a rigid body as its position slides above the
AAA domains. By contrast, each Rpt AAA domain exhibits a
distinct reconfiguration, manifested most obviously in different
extents of hinge-like rotation between the small and large AAA
subdomains (SI Appendix, Fig. S12 and Table S3). Both the OB
and AAA rings translate and tilt to align axially with the CP
channel (25–27). The current resolutions of the SB, SC, and SD
states are insufficient to resolve nucleotide densities. This leaves
an open question as to whether and how ATPase repositioning is
correlated with ATP hydrolysis cycles.

the major channel pathway. The pore-1 loops form a helical part of the
channel interior as illustrated by the dashed green line. (D) Close-up side

Side-chain patterns observed along the substrate-translocation pathway are
highlighted. The five tyrosine residues, highlighted by transparent sphere
representation, and a number of hydrophobic and negatively charged residues decorate the AAA channel; color codes for ATPase protomers match
those shown in A. (Inset) A schematic cartoon showing that the pore-2 loops
of Rpt3, Rpt4, and Rpt5 pair laterally with the pore-1 loops of Rpt4, Rpt5,

as wide as those of the AAA channel.

and does not contribute to these constrictions in the SA and SB
states (Fig. 4 C and D). Consistent with the observed displacement, mutating the pore-2 loop of Rpt6 had little impact on
protein-degradation rates (36).
RP–CP Interactions. The interface between the RP and CP is
dominated by the associations of the hexameric AAA-ATPases
and the heptameric α-ring (Fig. 5A). This symmetry-mismatched
interface buries ∼3,600 Å2 of surface area in the SA state (SI Appendix, Table S2). All Rpt subunits but Rpt6 are in direct contact
with the α-ring (Fig. 5A). A large gap between Rpt6 and the α2subunit is forced by the amino-terminal PCI domain of Rpn6,
which itself contacts α2, preventing Rpt6 from directly contacting
the α-ring (Fig. 5A). The amino-terminal PCI domain of Rpn6
extends down to the lateral surface of the α2-subunit, making an
∼620-Å2 contact, which is perhaps critical for stabilizing the lateral
position of Rpn6 (SI Appendix, Fig. S15 A and C). The aminoterminal PCI domain of Rpn5 is also found lateral to the CP, although its contact area with α1 is small (∼50 Å2).
Previous biochemical studies on the yeast proteasome suggested that the C termini of Rpt2, Rpt3, and Rpt5 contain
conserved C-terminal HbYX motifs that insert into pockets
formed between adjacent α-subunits (40, 41). In the SA state, the
HbYX motifs of both Rpt3 and Rpt5 insert into the α1–α2 and

α5–α6 pockets, respectively (Fig. 5 C and D and SI Appendix, Fig.
S15 G and H). Consistent with previous structural data, Tyr417
in Rpt3 and Tyr438 in Rpt5 interact with Gly20-O of the α1subunit and Gly19-O of the α5-subunit, respectively, through
hydrogen bonding. The terminal carboxyl groups of Lys418 in
Rpt3 and Ala438 in Rpt5 form hydrogen bonds with Lys64 of α2
(Fig. 5C) and Lys62 of α6 (Fig. 5D), respectively. These contacts
are remarkably conserved, as they have previously been noted for
homomeric proteasome precursors from archaea (41). By contrast, experimental density corresponding to the C-terminal HbYX
tail (residues 434 to 440) of Rpt2 is missing, whereas there is no
additional density in the α3–α4 pocket (SI Appendix, Fig. S15D).
Similarly, the carboxyl-terminal tails of Rpt1 and Rpt4 do not
insert into any α-pockets (SI Appendix, Fig. S15 E and F). These
structural features may explain the previous finding that the
extreme C termini of Rpt3 and Rpt5 are essential for assembly
of the human proteasome (42, 43).
Gating of the CP Channel. In the states in which the CP channel is

closed (i.e., SA, SB, and SC), only Rpt3 and Rpt5 are found to
have their C termini inserted into α-pockets (Fig. 5A and SI
Appendix, Fig. S15 G–J). By contrast, in the SD state, the carboxyl-terminal tails of Rpt1, Rpt2, and Rpt6 are inserted into the
α4–α5, α3–α4, and α2–α3 pockets, respectively (Fig. 5 E–G).
Thus, except for Rpt4, all Rpt carboxyl-terminal tails are inserted
into α-pockets in the SD state (SI Appendix, Fig. S15 K–M). The
Chen et al.

principal channel-blocking tails are from α2 and α4; the α3-tail,
which behaves as a lynchpin of the gate (44), is controlled by
Rpt2 (Fig. 2N) (40). The reorientation of these tails constitutes
gating and controls substrate entry into the CP. Consistently, the
AAA-ATPase heterohexamer is translated for ∼5 Å and rotates
for ∼2° on the α-ring in the SC state, and is further translated for
∼10 Å and rotated for ∼4° in the SD state. Although the aminoterminal tails of α2, α3, and α4 are rotated over a large angle to
roughly align along the heptameric axis to open the CP gate in
the SD state (Figs. 2 O and P and 5 A and B), the helical elements
connected to the gate-blocking tails in the α-ring are nearly
identical to those in other states. This is reminiscent of the observation of the open gate of the yeast CP in complex with the
11S regulator from Trypanosoma brucei (33, 41).
Comparison of the RP–CP interface among different conformational states reveals a structural mechanism for gating of the
CP channel. The initial repositioning of the ATPase ring on the
α-ring in the SC state follows a large rotation of ∼40° in the lid in
the SB state. However, this movement is insufficient to allow
the insertion of additional Rpt carboxyl-terminal tails into the
α-pockets, leaving the CP channel closed in the SC state. Further
movement of the ATPase ring on the α-ring eventually allows the
carboxyl-terminal tails of Rpt1, Rpt2, and Rpt6 to reach their
nearest α-pockets. The insertion of these Rpt carboxyl-terminal
tails into the α-pockets rotates the three gate-blocking tails of
α2–α3–α4 to approximately align along the axial direction, which
opens the CP channel in the SD state. Importantly, our observations indicate that the open state of the CP channel in the
human holoenzyme cannot be immediately achieved through
RP–CP association. Instead, opening of the CP channel is primed
through a series of coordinated, stepwise remodeling events
around the RP–CP interface, including a lid reconfiguration,
ATPase repositioning, and insertion of three additional Rpt
carboxyl-terminal tails into the α-pockets (Fig. 5H).
Discussion
The coexistence of four conformational states, one of which is
open in its CP gate under common solution conditions, provides
insights into the dynamic regulation of the proteasome holoenzyme (Fig. 5H). We may assume SA, the most populated state, to
represent a ground state, whereas SD, the state most distinct from
SA, to represent the translocating or fully engaged state of the
proteasome, in accordance with prior studies of the yeast proteasome (7, 25–28) (SI Appendix, Fig. S8 E and F). By structural
criteria (SI Appendix, Table S3), the SB and SC states may represent intermediates between SA and SD, and may describe a progression of conformational transitions that is temporally ordered:
SA is converted to SB, then to SC and SD (Fig. 5H). These transitions, although apparently inherent to the proteasome, are
expected to be guided by interactions with substrate, particularly
the engagement of substrate by the AAA pore loops. The transition from SA to SB involves local dissociation of the Rpn5–Rpt6
and Rpn6–Rpt6 interfaces. This may topologically destabilize the
lid conformation in the SA state, allowing it to rotate around
ATPase with a large angle (∼40°). The key consequence of this lid
rotation is the repositioning of Rpn11 above the OB ring, which
was thought to free the Rpn11 catalytic loop and mobilize its Ins-1
region (15, 18, 25). This suggests that Rpn11 may be enhanced in
its deubiquitinating activity in the SB, SC, and SD states (25).
Rearrangement of the lid may not only reposition Rpn11 but also
perturb the RP–CP interface, including the lateral contact of Rpn6
to the CP. The dissolution of this contact may release a constraint
on movement of the ATPase heterohexamer on the α-ring in the SC
and SD states. The stepwise repositioning of the ATPases on the
α-ring aligns axially the OB ring and the AAA channel with the CP
channel (25–27), allowing a major change in the ATPase–CP interface, where additional Rpt carboxyl-terminal tails are inserted
into the α-pockets, to eventually open the CP gate in the SD state.
In both the SC and SD states, a major rearrangement of the
AAA channel would allow the pore loops from Rpt3 and Rpt4,
the first Rpt pair interacting with an incoming substrate, to move

toward the CP (SI Appendix, Fig. S12). The contrasting sidechain patterns of the pore loops—the hydrophobic pore-1 versus
the highly charged pore-2 loops—suggest that they might play
distinct roles in processive substrate translocation (36, 45). We
speculate that the pore-1 loops may propel substrates forward
along the AAA channel through hydrophobic interactions, whereas
the pore-2 loops translate their interactions with substrates into enhancement of ATP hydrolysis (46), possibly by controlling the configuration of the conserved glutamate residue in the Walker B motif
(39) (SI Appendix, Fig. S16).
Taken together, our structural data lead to a model where
stepwise, distributed conformational changes within the holoenzyme are coordinated so as to generate a series of enzymatic regulatory events: The deubiquitinating activity of Rpn11 is enhanced
in an SB-like state; the ATPase activity is likely heightened in an SClike state, which can initiate substrate translocation; and eventually
the CP gate is opened for degradation in a translocation-competent
SD-like state. In the presence of a substrate in the translocation
channel, we would imagine that the open gate would be stabilized
until completion of substrate degradation.
