TcaR and IcaR are a weak and a strong negative regulator of transcription of the ica locus, respectively, and their presence prevents
the poly-N-acetylglucosamine production and biofilm formation in
Staphylococcus epidermidis. Although TcaR was shown to interact
with the ica promoter, the precise binding region and the mechanism of interaction remained unclear. Here we present the 3D structure of TcaR in its apo form and in complex with salicylate as well as
several aminoglycoside and β-lactam antibiotics. A comparison of
the native and complex TcaR structures indicates that the mechanism of regulation involves a large conformational change in the
DNA-binding lobe. Here, we deduced the consensus binding sequence of two [∼TTNNAA] hexamers embedded in a 16 bp sequence
for a TcaR dimer. Six TcaR dimers bind specifically to three approximately 33 bp segments close to the IcaR binding region with varying
affinities, and their repressor activity is directly interfered by salicylate and different classes of natural antimicrobial compounds. We
also found in this study that the antimicrobial compounds we tested
were shown not only to inhibit TcaR–DNA interaction but also to
further induce biofilm formation in S. epidermidis in our in vivo
assay. The results support a general mechanism for antibiotics in
regulating TcaR–DNA interaction and thereby help understand
the effect of antibiotic exposure on bacterial antibiotic resistance
through biofilm formation.

S

taphylococci are among the most common cause of bacterial
infections in the community, which have been, and continue
to be a major cause of human disease resulting in over than one
million infections each year worldwide. Staphylococcus aureus is
the best known and by far most studied staphylococcal species
that produces hospital- and community-acquired infections, with
methicillin-resistant S. aureus posing a serious public health
threat (1, 2). S. epidermidis is the sister species of S. aureus, which
often causes infection in immunocompromised individuals or
those after damage to the epithelium. Similar to S. aureus, it
produces biofilm to protect itself from host immune system
and enhance their resistance to antibiotic chemotherapy (3). Because biofilm tolerance is of major clinical relevance and >60% of
the bacterial infections currently are involved in the biofilm
formation (4), it is important to study those issues.
The key component of the biofilm extracellular matrix in
S. epidermidis is polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA) (5),
an essential factor in biofilm formation composed of homopolymer of β-1,6-linked N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc). The production of PIA depends on the expression of the icaADBC operon,
which encodes three membrane proteins (IcaA, IcaD, and IcaC)
(6–8). The ica operon is negatively regulated by a repressor
encoded by an upstream gene of IcaR (9–11). Even though
our knowledge of the regulation of the ica locus is limited, recent
studies have shown that TcaR acts as a regulatory factor to affect
the transcription of icaADBC (11). The close relation between
TcaR and IcaR proteins suggest a synergistic effect and they both
regulate IcaA transcription, poly-N-acetylglucosamine production, and biofilm formation (11).

TcaR is a MarR family transcription regulator that is involved
in teicoplanin and methicillin resistance (12). Therefore, it was
originally described as a putative transcriptional regulator of
the teicoplanin-associated locus (tca). As the MarR-type proteins
can act as positive, negative, or both positive and negative regulators, TcaR also acts as a multifunctional regulator, not only as a
regulatory factor to affect the transcription of icaADBC (11), the
first regulator reported for cell wall-anchored proteins (spa and
sasF), but also as the regulator of sarS (13, 14). In addition, TcaR
upregulates sarS and thus spa expression, and represses the SasF
production.
The crystal structures of a number of MarR family proteins
have been reported, including MarR from Escherichia coli
(15), SlyA from Enterococcus faecalis (16), OhrR from Bacillis
subtilis (17), MexR from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (18), and MarR
from Xanthomonas campestris (19). These structures revealed
that MarR family proteins are all homodimers and that each
monomer contains a winged helix-turn-helix (wHTH) DNAbinding domain.
Antibiotic resistance is an increasing problem throughout the
developed world. Given the importance of MarR family protein
in antibiotic resistance, an understanding of the mechanism of
their regulation is urgently needed for efficient treatment of bacterial infections. Here, to study how the ica operon is controlled,
and to investigate the role of TcaR in antibiotic resistance, TcaR
from S. epidermidis was overexpressed in E. coli with a His tag to
facilitate purification. The crystal structure of TcaR was solved by
multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) method using
protein containing seleno-methionines. Furthermore, DNA-binding assays, in vivo biofilm formation assay, and computer modeling were used to elucidate the regulation mechanism of the ica
operon. Finally, we present the structures of TcaR complexed
with salicylate (Sal) and four antibiotics, namely, ampicillin
(Amp), kanamycin (Kan), methicillin (Meth), and penicillin G
(PnG), to elucidate the regulation mechanism of TcaR. Several
mutations of amino acids involved in the antibiotic binding were
also made to validate the interactions between the antibiotics
and TcaR.
Results and Discussion
Features of the TcaR Structure. The crystal structures of the native
TcaR and SeMet–TcaR derivative in the space group P61 were
refined to 2.3 and 2.9 Å, respectively, both yielding low R and
Rfree values and stereochemical deviations (Table S1). The refined TcaR structure contains two TcaR molecules (denoted
chain A and chain B) in the asymmetric unit, forming a dimer,

consistent with the earlier results that MarR family proteins bind
to the operator as a dimer (15–18). The sequence alignment of
TcaR with other MarR family proteins is shown in Fig. S1. The
overall structure of TcaR belongs to the α∕β family protein as
observed in other MarR family proteins. The TcaR dimer adopts
a triangular topology with each monomer consisted of secondary
structure α1-α2-α3-α4-βA-βB-α5-α6 (Fig. 1A). The N and the
C-terminus α-helices (α1, 5, 6) interdigitate with those of the
other monomer to produce dimerization interaction. Strands
βA and βB form a β-hairpin, which is slightly twisted and constitutes the typical winged motif. Between βA and βB is the flexible
winged region (residues 84–96), which had poor electron density in
the initial 2Fo-Fc map. In addition, using the program CAVER, we
observed a highly porous structure with several cavities for potential ligand binding in the TcaR dimer. All cavities are located at
the dimer interface, surrounded by helices α1, α2, α3, α5, and
α6. Furthermore, these intermolecular cavities are large enough
to encapsulate the ligands we tested in EMSA assay below.
The wHTH DNA-binding domain is composed of α2-α3-α4βA-W1-βB that adopts the winged-helix fold similar to the winged
helix (wH) domain described in other MarR family protein
(15–18). The DNA-binding site expected to be facing the
DNA, is densely positively charged in a surface patch (Fig. 1B),
which includes Lys60, Lys65, Arg70, Arg71, Lys73, Lys74, Lys82,
Lys85, Arg93, Lys95, and Lys98, all of which are solvent-exposed
and most are contributed by helix α3 and α4. Electrostatic interactions involving those positively charged amino acids must play
most important roles for DNA binding.
Noncooperative Binding to the Operator DNA. As reported earlier,
E. coli MarR binds as a dimer at two separate but similar sites in
marO (20). Footprinting experiments revealed that MarR protects approximately 21 bp of DNA on both strands at a single site
and does not bend its target DNA (21). The crystal structure of
OhrR-ohrA operator complex showed that the protein-DNA
contact region includes the major groove of the −10 region
(TACAAT) and indicated that OhrR, similar to MarR, represses
transcription by blocking the access of RNA polymerase to this
promoter region (17).
It is known that TcaR binds and regulates ica promoter (11),
and the result of band shift assays indicated that there could be

multiple TcaR recognition sites within the ica promoter sequence.
To investigate the regulation mechanism of TcaR, we inspected
the ica promoter sequence and proposed that there are three possible TcaR-binding sites on the ica operon, which are consecutive
33-mer pseudopalindromic sequences each containing consensus
sequence TTNNAA (Fig. 2A). Alternatively, another possible
arrangement of the consensus sequence TTNNAA is indicated
in Fig. S2B. To track down the precise location of the TcaR-binding site, a series of dsDNA segments were designed and tested for
TcaR-binding by electrophoretic motility shift assay. To determine
whether TcaR binds to each of these three 33-mer sequences, we
prepared 33-bp duplex DNAs and analyzed its interaction with
TcaR using EMSA, with an increasing concentration of TcaR protein. The negative controls Control 1 and Control 2 are the AT
rich and GC rich fragments of IcaA gene, respectively (Fig. 2B).
As shown in Fig. 2C, TcaR does not bind to Control 1 and Control
2 DNA sequences, whereas TcaR appears to have a strong
interaction with DNA fragments DNA1, DNA2, and DNA3,
indicating that each of these DNAs interacts with TcaR. Among
the latter segments, DNA1 showed the most significant effect by
TcaR on its mobility, suggesting the strongest interaction between
them. Consequently, the result indicates that the most favorite
TcaR binding site is located immediately adjacent to the IcaR
binding site.
TcaR is a multifunctional regulator that not only acts as a
negative regulator for ica operator but also as a positive regulator
for sarS gene and a negative regulator for sasF gene (13). To
search for other possible TcaR-binding regions and to further
clarify the regulation function of TcaR, we designed two DNA
sequences according to the EMSA result in Fig. 2C, designated
Consensus 1 and Consensus 2 (Fig. 2B), to test their interaction
ability with TcaR. As seen in Fig. 2D, Consensus 1 had virtually
the same binding strengths as DNA1 to the TcaR dimer with no
cooperativity, whereas Consensus 2 appeared to have weaker interactions with TcaR. Therefore, we can use Consensus 1 DNA
sequence to search for more TcaR binding sites on the entire
S. epidermidis genome and to further unmask the multifunctional
role of TcaR.
The Effects of Salicylate and Antibiotics on TcaR Repressor Activity. As
mentioned earlier, TcaR works as a repressor in the negative

regulation of the icaADBC genes, whose expression is required
for PIA synthesis and biofilm formation (10, 11). However, the
mechanism of how TcaR inactivates icaADBC genes remains
unclear. In the previous studies of MarR family protein, diverse
anionic lipophilic (usually phenolic) effector molecules were
shown to bind to the repressor and altered its conformation
(15, 20, 22, 23). Recently, it was reported that biofilm formation
in bacteria can be induced by aminoglycoside antibiotics (24).
Here, to investigate the possible effect of some drugs on TcaR,
eight compounds were tested for their potential inhibition on
TcaR–DNA interaction (Fig. S3). These include salicylate, which
is known to bind and inactivate MarR in E. coli (20), three betalactam antibiotics (penicillin G, ampicillin, and methicillin) that
contain a β-lactam nucleus in their molecular structure and act by
inhibiting the synthesis of the peptidoglycan layer of bacterial cell
walls, three aminoglycoside antibiotics (kanamycin, gentamicin,
and streptomycin) that are composed of several sugar groups
and amino groups, and bacteriostatic antimicrobial (chloramphenicol), which is considered as a prototypical broad-spectrum
antibiotic.
As shown in Fig. 2E, sodium salicylate interfered with the
DNA-binding activity of TcaR at a concentration of 2 μM,
and this effect was more pronounced at a higher concentration,
suggesting that salicylate inhibited the formation of TcaR-ica
operon complex. In addition, three beta-lactam antibiotics we
identified in TcaR complexes also appeared to antagonize the
DNA-binding activity of TcaR. Identical results were obtained
with three other aminoglycoside antibiotics in the EMSA experiment. Moreover, another antibiotic, chloromphenicol, was also
observed to inhibit the DNA-binding activity of TcaR with a significant greater extent. Thus, we believe that diverse kinds of antibiotics may interact with TcaR to regulate its repressor activity.
Because some antibiotics, such as gentamicin and streptomycin,
were shown to bind and inactivate IcaR (25), the experimental
results suggest that several antibiotics at low concentrations
can interact directly with TcaR and IcaR and thus interfere with

the repressor activity of TcaR and IcaR to induce the expression
of icaADBC and thereby elicit bioﬁlm production in S. epidermidis, as a defense mechanism.
Crystal Structure of TcaR Complexed with Salicylate. Up to now, only
two structures of the MarR family protein complexes have been
reported, one is complexed with DNA (17, 26), and the other is
complexed with salicylate (15, 26, 27). To elucidate the mechanism
of how the interaction with the ligands alleviates ica operon binding ability of TcaR, we solved several TcaR complex structures.
The TcaR–salicylate complex structure was determined to
2.45 Å resolution with eight molecules of salicylates bound
to nonequivalent positions on each dimer designated SAL1 to
SAL8 (Fig. 3A). Although the TcaR–salicylate structure and
apo TcaR are well superimposed with a rmsd of 1.5 Å using
276 corresponding Cα atoms, the binding of salicylate drives a
significant conformational change (Fig. S4 A and B). There is
a more obvious conformational change in the DNA-binding
domain (especially on helices α3 and α4) than the dimerization
domain of each monomer. The additional results and discussion of
the TcaR–salicylate complex (Fig. S5) could be found in SI Text. This
conformational change is asymmetric and may cause the TcaR–
DNA interactions to become unfavorable, as discussed below.
Crystal Structure of TcaR Complexed with Antibiotics (Penicillin G).

E. coli MarR has been reported as a multidrug binding protein
that can be inhibited from binding its cognate DNA site by several
anionic compounds, which include 2,4-dinitrophenicol, plumbagin, menadione, and salicylate, with their apparent binding
affinities to MarR being 250, 250, 800, and 500 μM, respectively
(28). In addition to these bacterial multidrug resistance regulators, ampicillin at a concentration of 5 mM appeared to antagonize the DNA-binding activity of MarR, and a slight effect
was also observed when the chloramphenicol concentration
was increased to approximately 10 mM (28). These findings
suggest that MarR has a broadly specific, low-affinity substrate

binding ability. However, it is still unclear how the binding of
these compounds interferes with the DNA-binding ability
of MarR.
In the present study, we not only detected several antibiotics
that can interfere with the DNA-binding activity of TcaR at a
relative low concentration (2 μM, 5,000-fold lower than the
determined binding constant for E. coli MarR), but also solved
numerous TcaR–antibiotic complex structures to help elucidate
the mechanism of drug-induced structural changes in TcaR.
The TcaR–penicillin G (PnG) complex structure was determined
to 2.55 Å resolution in the space group P61 , and the structure was
refined to a final Rwork value of 23.3% and an Rfree value of 27.3%
(Table S2). There are two distinct PnG binding sites in each
dimer, one is located at the interface between the DNA-binding
domain and the helical dimerization domain and the other is
identified at the interface of three TcaR dimer molecules in
the asymmetric unit along the crystallographic c axis (Fig. 3B).
As seen in Fig. S4 A and B, significant conformational changes
between apo TcaR and the TcaR–PnG complex with a rmsd of
1.4 Å using 274 Cα atoms are also observed, particularly in
the DNA-binding domain. These conformational changes
shorten the C termini of the α3∕α0 3 helices from 26.0 Å for
the TcaR–DNA model to 18.6 Å for the TcaR–PnG complex
(Cα-Cα distance between Asn A61 and Asn B61) and the N termini of the α4∕α0 4 helices from 31.2 Å for TcaR–DNA model to
26.4 Å for the TcaR–PnG complex (Cα-Cα distance between Lys
A65 and Lys B65). The antibiotics induced conformational
change further interfering with the DNA binding of TcaR. This
observation supports our EMSA assay in which several antibiotics
exhibit inhibition effect on the TcaR–DNA formation.
Consistent with the observation in the TcaR–salicylate complex, the binding of PnG produced an asymmetric structural
change in the wHTH motif. Superposition of apo TcaR on the
PnG–TcaR complex shows that the A chains are superimposed
better than the B chains with rmsd values of 0.9 and 1.3, respectively. This nonequivalent conformational change may be due to
the nonequivalent position of PnG-binding sites on the dimer
molecule. The detailed interactions of PnG1 and PnG2 are shown
in Fig. 3 C and D. One PnG molecule, PnG1 is located in the
8620 ∣

www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.0913302107

binding pocket between the DNA-binding domain and the dimerization domain (Fig. 3C). This binding site is formed by helices α1
and α2 of chain A. The amino acid composition of this binding
site includes Asn A20, Leu A26, Leu A27, Ala A38, and His A42.
The amide and the carboxyl groups of Asn A20 are 2.9 and 3.2 Å
away from the carboxylic acid of the thiazolidine ring and the
carbonyl group on the β-lactam ring, respectively. Moreover,
the NH of the backbone amide group of Ala A38 is just 2.9 Å
away from the carbonyl group of PnG1. This indicates the interacting residues mentioned above might interact with PnG1 via
ionic or hydrogen bond interaction. In the other PnG binding site
(PnG2), a PnG molecule is identified at crystal contact between
three TcaR molecules related by crystallographic symmetry
(Fig. 3D). This binding pocket is formed by the helix α′4 of chain
B, helix α1 of chain A on the symmetry related molecule at the
bottom left corner, and helix α1 of chain A on the symmetry related molecule at the bottom right corner in the orientation
shown in Fig. 3B. In this second binding site, PnG molecule is
not only forming interaction with Asn B64, Arg B70, Lys B74,
and water but also with Tyr A34 of the symmetry related molecule
at the bottom left corner. The carboxylic acid of the thiazolidine
ring of PnG2 forms hydrogen bond to water and NH of the backbone amide group of Tyr A43. The carbonyl group of PnG2 interacts with the side chain of residues Arg B70 and Lys B74. We have
also solved three other TcaR–antibiotic complexes (two β-lactam
antibiotics Amp, Meth, and an aminoglycoside Kan) (Fig. S6)
with similar protein–ligand interaction as described above. Please
see SI Text for additional results and discussion.
Structure Comparison. Comparison of apo TcaR with all
TcaR–antibiotic complexes we solved in this work reveals that
the overall topology is similar (Fig. S7A). Each of those complexes has two antibiotic binding sites, one is located in the cavity
at the junction of the helical dimerization domain and the wHTH
DNA-binding domain, which we suggest as the first binding site,
and the second binding site is found alongside the helix α4 of
chain B, which is in the crystal contact interface of three TcaR
dimer molecules in the asymmetric unit along the crystallographic
c axis. We propose that the first binding site is more important
Chang et al.

Model of Antibiotics Binding and its Activation of Transcription. As
discussed above, TcaR in its antibiotic-bound conformation is
unlikely to bind its sequence specific DNA-binding site. The inactivation and the regulation of TcaR by antibiotics as deduced
from our observation can be summarized into three different
mechanisms. First, the binding of antibiotics might reduce the flexibility of the winged DNA-binding domain and stabilize the TcaR
dimer conformation that is unable to accommodate the insertion
of recognition helices into the major grooves of target DNA. Second, antibiotics probably cause conformational changes on TcaR
dimer by shrinking the distance between the wHTH motifs, thereby
causing severe steric clashes with the target DNA backbone and
making it incompatible with DNA-binding. Third, because the
second binding site is close to the DNA-binding helix α4, it would
be suitably positioned to influence DNA-binding directly. Taken
together, the explanatory hypotheses for the regulatory mechanisms provide a unique explanation of the regulation role for
proteins in the MarR transcriptional regulator family.
In our present studies, we have noticed that antibiotics would
be implicated in eliciting biofilm formation by interfering with the
Chang et al.

binding of IcaR to DNA (25). Although the exact mechanism is
not well understood, we propose a regulatory mechanism for
IcaA expression based on the analysis we have done. Schematic
representation of the proposed mechanism is shown in Fig. S7C.
At first, TcaR repressors bind to the ica promoter in the absence
of any inhibitor and prevent transcription of the IcaA gene. There
are multiple TcaR recognition sites within the ica promoter sequence and the DNA fragment closest to the IcaR-binding site,
which we refer to as “DNA1,” is the most suitable binding site for
TcaR. Upon entering of some antibiotics to the cell, significant
conformational changes in the DNA-binding domains of TcaR
will be exerted, inducing the inactivation and the departure of
these transcriptional repressors from the ica promoter, thus increasing the transcription and subsequent expression of IcaA.
To investigate the biological effect of antibiotics on the ica operon, biofilm formation was examined in S. epidermidis RP62A in
microtiter wells after treatment with several different antibiotics
following the protocol of Wakimoto et al. (29). As seen in Fig. 4,
the biofilm formation was significantly induced by subinhibitory
concentrations of several antibiotics, especially in Kan. The result
is consistent with the previous observation that biofilm formation
can be stimulated by vancomycin in S. epidermidis clinical strains
(30). The regulation of ica promoter transcription activity by
TcaR can be further analyzed using β-galactosidase or GFP reporter system, and the analyses are currently under progress.
Because Staphylococcus is a big threat to the society and the
biofilm formation is a fundamental survival mechanism of Staphylococcus, a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying biofilm formation is necessary to achieve a better
management of Staphylococcus infection. Our work of the crystal
structure of apo TcaR and its complexes with several ligands
(including important clinical antibiotics) reveals the allosteric mechanism responsible for derepressing the production of PIA, the
major component of biofilm in S. epidermidis. We have also shown
that TcaR binds to the DNA fragments in ica operon, especially to
DNA1, and its DNA-binding activity is negatively modulated by
several antibiotics. Such observations may help us understand
the mechanism of the MarR family of transcriptional regulators
involved in antimicrobial resistance and virulence.
To combat resistant strains of bacteria, unique molecular
targets are being tested for the development of new antibiotics.
The golden pigment of staphyloxanthin from S. aures is such an

than the second one and is sufficient to modulate the activity of
TcaR. This hypothesis is accordance with the observation seen in
recently solved structure of MTH313-salicylate complex (27), as
discussed below.
When we superimposed all TcaR–ligand complexes, as seen
in Fig. S4 A and B, significant conformational changes were observed in the wHTH motifs, especially on chain B. According to
the structural differences between these complexes, two kinds of
steric movements of the wHTH motif were revealed. One is that
the wHTH motif of chain B twisted with the respect to the dimerization domain, making itself apart from the suitable orientation
for DNA-binding (i.e., TcaR–Sal complex and TcaR–PnG complex). On the other hand, the wHTH motifs were also twisted
to each other to produce a sheared orientation with the most
contracted distance between the recognition helices α3∕α0 3 and
α4∕α0 4 (i.e., TcaR–Amp complex, TcaR–Meth complex, and
TcaR–Kan complex). Nevertheless, a displacement of 2.8–4.2 Å
was seen along the wHTH motif measured from the Cα of Glu
B84 and the N termini of helix α4 showed the displacement of
around 3.1–4.5 Å (measured from the Cα of Lys B65). Although
the amino acid composition of chain A and chain B is identical in all
TcaR–ligand complex structures, the conformational changes
are more prominent at chain B in every TcaR–ligand complexes
we solved. The asymmetric allosteric mechanism awaits further
investigation.
Moreover, superimposition of the TcaR–ligand complexes and
the TcaR–DNA model revealed a displacement of α′4 recognition
helix especially in the TcaR–Amp, TcaR–Meth, and TcaR–Kan
complexes, which would result in severe steric clashes with the
DNA backbone (Fig. 3E). Noteworthily, the first binding site
in TcaR does not appear to be a direct steric hindrance for
the DNA backbone. It is likely that antibiotics could interact with
TcaR at the first binding site on TcaR–DNA complex and cause
some conformational changes in the wHTH motifs, further weakening the affinity of TcaR to its target DNA sequence and finally
induce the departure of TcaR from ica promoter. The hypothesis
deduced from our observation clarified that the binding of one
antibiotic molecule to the first binding site is sufficient to modulate the DNA-binding activity of TcaR. To confirm this hypothesis, two kinds of TcaR mutant were designed: One is A38W/
S41W/H42W for the first binding site, and the other is R70A/
K74A for the second binding site. As seen in Fig. S7B, treatment
of the antibiotics does not interfere with the DNA-binding activity of the triple mutant A38W/S41W/H42W. However, antibiotics
treatment inhibits the formation of R70A/K74A–DNA complex.
Consequently, the result shows that the first binding site of TcaR
is the critical site for the DNA-binding inhibition.

Fig. 4. The biofilm formation of the clinical S. epidermidis RP62A supplemented with different concentrations of antibiotics. The biofilm was
measured by staining with crystal violet in microtiter wells (A570 ). The culture
was treated with each antibiotic at 5 different concentrations (bar bar 1 ¼
0.5 μM, bar 2 ¼ 5 μM, bar 3 ¼ 50 μM, bar 4 ¼ 500 μM, bar 5 ¼ 5 mM). Each
bar shows the average and standard error of three independent experiments.

example (31). It is possible the TcaR/MarR system in S. epidermidis and S. aureus may be considered as targets. If ligands that
bind more tightly and specifically to the promoter region of IcaA
could be discovered or designed, their DNA-binding would shut
down the production of PIA and formation of biofilm.
Materials and Methods
Protein Expression, Purification, Crystallization, and Data Collection. The TcaR
gene was amplified directly from the S. epidermidis RP62A genome by PCR
and cloned into pET-16b (Novagen). The native TcaR and selenomethioninelabeled protein were produced in E. coli. Additional experimental details can
be found in SI Materials and Methods.

Structure Determination, Model Building, and Refinement. Initial phase angles
were calculated by employing the program SOLVE (32) and using the MAD
data of SeMet–TcaR in the resolution range of 30–2.9 Å. There are 6 selenium
sites located in one molecule, and the phase angles were determined by
the single-wavelength anomalous diffraction method using the peak wavelength data. Subsequently, the electron density map was improved using the
program RESOLVE (33), and the model was built into density using the

program O (34). Manual building of the remaining model and further reﬁnement were carried out with the programs Xtalview (35) and CNS (36)
against the 2.9 Å resolution dataset of the SeMet–TcaR crystal. The
structure of native TcaR was determined by molecular replacement using
CNS, with the reﬁned structure of SeMet–TcaR as a search model. For each
structure, iterative cycles of model building with Xtalview and computational
reﬁnement with CNS were performed, in which 5% reﬂections were set aside
for Rfree calculation (37). The stereochemical quality was assessed with the
program PROCHECK (38). The molecular ﬁgures were produced by using
PyMOL (DeLano Scientiﬁc, http://www.pymol.org) and the possible cavities
in TcaR were identified by program CAVER (39).
