Collisions between cellular DNA replication machinery (replisomes)
and damaged DNA or immovable protein complexes can dissociate
replisomes before the completion of replication. This potentially
lethal problem is resolved by cellular “replication restart” reactions
that recognize the structures of prematurely abandoned replication forks and mediate replisomal reloading. In bacteria, this essential activity is orchestrated by the PriA DNA helicase, which
identifies replication forks via structure-specific DNA binding and
interactions with fork-associated ssDNA-binding proteins (SSBs).
However, the mechanisms by which PriA binds replication fork
DNA and coordinates subsequent replication restart reactions
have remained unclear due to the dearth of high-resolution structural information available for the protein. Here, we describe the
crystal structures of full-length PriA and PriA bound to SSB. The
structures reveal a modular arrangement for PriA in which several
DNA-binding domains surround its helicase core in a manner that
appears to be poised for binding to branched replication fork DNA
structures while simultaneously allowing complex formation with
SSB. PriA interaction with SSB is shown to modulate SSB/DNA
complexes in a manner that exposes a potential replication initiation site. From these observations, a model emerges to explain
how PriA links recognition of diverse replication forks to replication restart.

eplisomes frequently encounter obstructions, such as impassable DNA damage or frozen protein complexes, that can
arrest replication and/or eject the replisome before completion
of replication (1–4). Left unrepaired, these events lead to incomplete chromosome duplication, genomic instability, and cell
death. All proliferating cells must contend with these clashes
because replication blockades can arise from essential endogenous cellular processes. Replication restart, the process by which
replisomes are reloaded onto abandoned replication forks, has
been observed in both bacteria and eukaryotes. However, only
the bacterial factors that mediate this process have been identified. The bacterial replication restart proteins thus serve as
models for understanding the general mechanisms of replication
restart in all cells (4).
Replication restart in bacteria is orchestrated by the multifunctional PriA DNA helicase (5, 6). The process is initiated by
PriA binding to abandoned DNA replication forks or other
appropriate replication reinitiation sites in a structure-specific
manner. In this recognition step, PriA binds to duplex parental
DNA and can accommodate either duplex or gapped leadingand lagging-strand DNA in branched replication fork structures
(7–10). PriA’s ability to recognize multiple DNA structures
appears to provide the flexibility needed for replication restart to
be initiated on structures ranging from simple replication forks
to D-loops that are produced by recombinational repair of
dsDNA breaks (5, 6, 10). However, the structural mechanism by
which PriA manages to bind to this array of substrates is unknown. In addition to structure-specific DNA binding, PriA
www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1318001111

takes advantage of a direct protein interaction with ssDNAbinding protein (SSB) tetramers to target its activity to replication forks. SSBs coat the lagging strand template when it is
single-stranded and form a complex with PriA that stimulates
PriA’s helicase activity (11–15). In this interaction, PriA binds to
the extreme C terminus (Ct) of SSB, which is a known docking
site for numerous genome maintenance proteins that process
ssDNA within SSB/ssDNA nucleoprotein complexes (16). Once
bound to an appropriate replication restart substrate, PriA
remodels the lagging-strand arm to expose ssDNA by either
unwinding DNA (if the lagging strand is duplex) or altering
the SSB-bound template DNA (if the lagging strand is ssDNA)
(17–19). The structural mechanisms underlying lagging-strand
remodeling by PriA have not been well defined. PriA then
recruits additional replication restart proteins (PriB and DnaT in
Escherichia coli) to complete formation of the PriA/PriB/DnaT
“primosome” complex that is competent to mediate the first step
of replication restart: loading of the replicative helicase (DnaB in
E. coli) onto the remodeled replication fork (20–24). Assembly
of the full replisome is then mediated by DnaB activities and
protein interactions.
Biochemical studies have identified a two-domain architecture
for PriA that includes a DNA-binding domain (DBD; N-terminal
∼200 residues) and a helicase domain (HD; C-terminal ∼530
residues) (18, 21, 25) (Fig. 1A). However, despite decades of
genetic and biochemical research, the lack of high-resolution
structural information for full-length PriA has left the molecular
mechanisms underlying abandoned replication fork recognition
Significance
This study describes the crystal structures of the full-length
PriA DNA helicase, a multifunctional enzyme that mediates the
essential process of restarting prematurely terminated DNA
replication reactions in bacteria. Our findings reveal how PriA is
able to recognize replication restart substrates through structure-specific DNA binding and interactions with the ssDNAbinding protein and how it exposes ssDNA that could be used
to reload the replisome and reinitiate replication. These observations shed light on the physical mechanisms that allow
cells to survive the common and potentially lethal problems
posed by incomplete genome replication.

and processing unresolved. To better understand the roles and
mechanisms of PriA in replication restart, we have determined
the X-ray crystal structures of full-length PriA and the PriA/SSBCt complex and examined the biochemical consequences of
PriA/SSB complex formation using a single-molecule approach.
The structures reveal a modular arrangement for PriA in which
its central helicase core is surrounded by an array of DNAbinding elements. These elements include two domains within
the DBD [a 3′ DNA-binding domain (3′BD) and an unusual
circularly permuted winged helix (WH) domain] and two
domains within the HD [a Cys-rich region (CRR) that binds two
Zn2+ ions and a C-terminal domain (CTD) with unanticipated
similarity to the S10 subunit of the bacterial ribosome]. The
positioning of these domains, coupled with their known or anticipated roles in DNA binding and replication fork remodeling,
leads to a model that explains how PriA binds to branched DNA
replication fork structures in a specific manner. SSB binds to
PriA at a site formed at the interface of the 3′BD, CTD, and
helicase core that appears to be positioned to allow simultaneous
PriA binding to both DNA and SSB. PriA interaction with SSB
through this site modulates the SSB/ssDNA complex in a manner
that exposes ssDNA that could be used to reload DnaB onto
abandoned replication forks. Together with the PriA DNAbinding model, these findings produce a molecular view of initial
steps of PriA-mediated replication restart.
Results and Discussion
PriA DNA Helicase X-Ray Crystal Structure Determination. Several

bacterial PriA proteins were initially selected as targets in our
crystallographic effort to determine the structure of full-length
PriA. Among these proteins, PriA from Klebsiella pneumoniae

(KpPriA) crystallized in a form that diffracted X-rays to a resolution of 2.65 Å (Table S1). KpPriA shares 88% sequence
identity with the prototypical E. coli PriA protein (EcPriA), and
the two proteins display very similar DNA-binding and DNAdependent ATPase activities with a synthetic forked DNA substrate (Fig. S1). Moreover, expression of the K. pneumoniae priA
gene complements the filamentation and constitutive SOS phenotypes of priA- E. coli cells (Fig. S1). Thus, KpPriA and EcPriA
are structural and functional homologs.
Single-wavelength anomalous diffraction data from a selenomethionine-substituted KpPriA crystal were used to calculate
a 3.76-Å resolution experimental electron density map that
allowed building of a partial model of the KpPriA structure. This
partial structure was then used as a search model to solve the
2.65-Å resolution native KpPriA structure via molecular replacement (Table S1).
The KpPriA structure comprises six subdomains that cluster
together (Fig. 1). Two of these subdomains (3′BD and WH)
comprise the N-terminal DBD, and the remaining four (two
lobes of the helicase core, CRR, and CTD) comprise the HD.
The 3′BD, helicase core, CRR, and CTD interact with one another to form a shallow cup shape, whereas the WH domain
projects away from the rest of KpPriA in a position that is stabilized by interactions with symmetrically related PriA proteins
in the crystal lattice (Fig. 1B). Because the WH lacks direct
contacts with the rest of KpPriA, its position is likely to be dynamic in the PriA monomer in solution, which may have led to
conformational heterogeneity that prevented crystallization of
other full-length PriA proteins. The electrostatic surface of PriA
includes prominent basic patches presented by the 3′BD, WH,
helicase, and CTD elements on its concave surface (Fig. 1C). A

PriA Structure Reveals Two Subdomains Within the DBD. The structure of KpPriA showed that the DBD is subdivided into two
DNA-binding elements. The first is the 3′BD, which has been
shown previously to bind the 3′ end of the leading-strand arm of
replication fork structures (26). This recognition is thought to
help direct PriA replisomal reloading activity to appropriate
DNA structures (25–28). The 3′BD structure from full-length
KpPriA is strikingly similar to the previously determined structure of the isolated 3′BD from EcPriA (26) (rmsd = 1.8 Å for
90 common Cα atoms). Residues that are known to bind the 3′
end of nascent leading-strand DNA in EcPriA (26) form an
exposed pocket in full-length KpPriA, making it available for
leading strand recognition in the apo structure (Fig. 1). A leadingstrand binding role for this site within full-length PriA is described further below in our model of the PriA/replication fork
structure complex.
The second DBD element is a WH domain, which has an
unusual circularly permuted topology that distinguishes it from
the classic WH fold. Typical WH domains are defined by core
helix–turn–helix folds with β-hairpin “wing” elements; these
motifs bind the major and minor grooves of duplex DNA, respectively, in many WH domains (29) (Fig. S2). The helix–turn–
helix fold is present within the PriA WH domain; however, the
β-hairpin wing element has been split open and serves as the
connection between the WH domain and the rest of PriA (Fig.
1B and Fig. S2). This β-hairpin splitting also alters the order of
secondary structural elements in the PriA domain relative to other
WH folds. This difference is accommodated by circular permutation in which the elements that serve as N- and C-terminal ends

in most WH domains are directly linked (Fig. S2). Despite these
differences, an EcPriA fragment comprising just the WH domain
is able to bind partial duplex DNA in vitro, and a longer fragment that includes both the 3′BD and WH domains binds DNA
replication fork structures with higher affinity than either domain alone, indicating that the two domains functionally cooperate (9). The most conserved surface of the WH domain
presents a highly basic patch from the helix–turn–helix motif on
the concave face of PriA that we speculate is important in replication fork DNA binding (below).
PriA HD Includes a Helicase Core and Unusual Zn2+-Binding Domain
and CTD with Roles in DNA Binding and Unwinding. The PriA HD is

composed of a bilobed helicase core region that is buttressed by
CRR and CTD elements (Figs. 1 and 2). The PriA helicase core
shares significant similarity with other helicases, with canonical
helicase motifs lining the interface between the two lobes. An
ADP molecule is bound at this interface (Fig. 2A). Two features
were identified within the helicase core that could provide important autoregulatory elements that restrict PriA ATPase activity in the absence of DNA. The first is a conserved aromaticrich loop (ARL) in the N-terminal helicase lobe that extends
from the helicase core to bind both the 3′BD and CTD (Fig. 2A).
Similar ARLs in RecQ and PcrA DNA helicases bind directly to
ssDNA and couple binding to structural changes that stimulate
ATPase and helicase activities (30, 31). Mutations within this
region of EcPriA block binding to D-loop DNA structures (25),
which is consistent with the ARL having a direct role in DNA
binding in PriA. The second feature is an extended helicase
motif V that positions the side chain of Lys543 between the
β-phosphate of ADP and the carboxyl group of Asp319 from
helicase motif II (Fig. 2A). This carboxyl group coordinates an
active site Mg2+ in other helicases. In the PcrA DNA helicase,

significant portion of the concave surface and more scattered
patches on the convex surface are evolutionarily well conserved
among PriA proteins (Fig. 1D).

a similar Lys modulates ATPase kinetics in a manner that appears
to stabilize the ADP product complex (32). Both the ARL and
Lys543 are highly conserved among PriA proteins (Fig. S1),
and we predict that they help coordinate PriA DNA-binding
and ATPase activities.
An unusual feature of the PriA HD is the presence of a CRR
embedded within the C-terminal helicase lobe (Fig. 2B). This 50residue insertion forms a structure on the surface of the helicase
core in which two Zn2+ ions are coordinated by invariant Cys
residues. A portion of the PriA CRR bears an unexpected
structural similarity to the N-terminal domain of the Rpb9 subunit
of eukaryotic RNA polymerase II [rmsd = 2.3 Å for 39 common
Cα atoms (33)], although the analogous Rpb9 domain only binds
a single Zn2+ ion. The functional significance of this structural
similarity is not known. Previous biochemical experiments have
shown that sequence changes to Zn2+-binding Cys residues in the
EcPriA CRR can eliminate helicase, but not ATPase, activity
and can block assembly of PriB onto DNA-bound PriA (24, 34),
implicating the CRR in multiple functions in PriA. Interestingly,
a β-hairpin within the CRR is in a similar position relative to
the PriA helicase core to “wedge” elements that are critical for
DNA strand separation in other related helicases (Fig. S3).
Given the position of the CRR and noted defects of EcPriA
CRR Cys variants in DNA unwinding, the β-hairpin within the
CRR is an excellent candidate to function as a DNA unwinding
wedge in PriA. In this activity, the helicase core would directionally translocate on an ssDNA tail of a partial duplex DNA
and pull the duplex into the β-hairpin wedge, which would split
the duplex into two strands. Given the 3′-5′ translocase and helicase activity of PriA and its preference for unwinding the lagging
strand of replication fork structures (11–13, 35, 36), this model
suggests that lagging strand template ssDNA would be engaged
by the helicase core, whereas the duplex portion of the lagging
strand would be unwound by the CRR. This arrangement could
create a PriA/DNA structure onto which PriB can dock during
primosome assembly and may be important for creating ssDNA
that acts as a loading site for DnaB.
The final element of the HD is the CTD, which forms a central
core in PriA that directly contacts all domains but the WH (Fig.
2C). The CTD is unexpectedly similar to the S10 ribosomal
subunit (rmsd = 2.2 Å for 68 common Cα atoms), which binds
branched rRNA within the bacterial ribosome (37) (Fig. 2D).
Several basic residues within the CTD project toward the HD
near where ssDNA is predicted to bind and are positioned

similar to RNA-binding residues in S10, highlighting their possible roles in DNA binding in PriA. To test the DNA-binding
properties of the PriA CTD, a recombinant EcPriA CTD was
constructed based on the KpPriA structure and tested for its
ability to bind to fluorescein-labeled DNA structures. The isolated CTD was able to bind to a variety of DNA structures in
vitro, including ssDNA, duplex DNA, and a replication fork
mimic (duplex DNA with 3′ and 5′ ssDNA tails) (Fig. 2E),
consistent with roles for the CTD in DNA binding in the context
of full-length PriA.
Structure and Function of the PriA/SSB Complex. In addition to
structure-specific DNA binding, PriA interacts with the SSB C
terminus (Ct) at replication forks (13–15). To identify the SSBCt binding site on PriA, we determined the 4.1-Å resolution
structure of KpPriA bound to an SSB-Ct peptide (Table S1). Although the resolution of the structure was modest, clear electron
density for the SSB-Ct peptide was observed in the Fo-Fc maps
that permitted fitting of the peptide (Fig. 3A). The SSB-Ct binds
at an evolutionarily conserved site formed at the junction of the
CTD, helicase core, and 3′BD that is on the opposite face of
PriA relative to the DNA-binding surface (Fig. 1). This partitioning would allow PriA to contact DNA and SSB simultaneously. The PriA SSB-Ct binding site shares similarity with
binding pockets characterized in other SSB-interacting proteins,
including the presence of a prominent basic residue (Arg697)
near the α-carboxyl group of the C-terminal–most residue of the
SSB-Ct (Fig. 3A). In other proteins, sequence changes at the
α-carboxyl interaction position dramatically destabilize their interactions with SSB (38–41).
Because SSB binding to ssDNA blocks reloading of DnaB
(42), we used a single-molecule FRET (smFRET) assay to test
whether direct binding of PriA to SSB could modulate SSB/DNA
complexes in a manner that exposes a potential ssDNA replisome reloading site. E. coli SSB binds ssDNA in either a highly
cooperative mode in which 35 nucleotides are bound per tetramer (SSB35) or a less cooperative mode that binds 65 nucleotides
per tetramer (SSB65) (43); these modes can be distinguished
in our assay by their differing FRET efficiencies between the
fluorescence donor/acceptor pair (Cy3/Cy5) on the DNA substrate (44) (Fig. 3B). When a single SSB tetramer is bound in the
SSB65 mode, Cy3/Cy5 is in close proximity (FRET efficiency of
∼0.4), but when two SSB tetramers are bound to the DNA in the
SSB35 mode, Cy3/Cy5 is further apart (FRET efficiency of ∼0.2)

Model for PriA-Mediated Replication Restart. A model emerges
from our data to explain how PriA can recognize diverse DNA
replication fork structures (Fig. 4). The arrangement of DBDs
within the PriA structure complements the positions of the three
DNA arms of branched replication fork and D-loop structures,
which could facilitate structure-specific DNA binding by PriA.
Within this array of domains, we propose that the 3′BD would
recognize the 3′ end of the leading strand as has been observed
previously (26), whereas the HD would preferentially bind to
lagging-strand DNA. Lagging-strand binding by the HD in this
model is consistent with PriA’s noted 3′-5′ translocase and
helicase activities and its preference for unwinding the nascent

lagging strand of replication fork structures (11–13, 35, 36). This
arrangement places the unreplicated parental DNA in an ideal
position to be bound by the highly basic surface presented by the
helix–turn–helix fold in the PriA WH domain (Figs. 1C and 4).
The isolated EcPriA WH domain has been shown to bind partial
duplex DNA (9), further supporting its suggested role in parental
DNA binding. Finally, given the ability of the CTD to bind to
a variety of DNA structures (Fig. 2E), it could contribute to
binding ssDNA, duplex DNA, or branched DNA that is presented by the helicase core and/or the 3′BD. Our binding model
thus explains how the structure of PriA is specifically adapted to
recognize appropriate substrates for replication restart.
Following recognition of an abandoned replication fork, PriA
must alter the lagging strand to expose an ssDNA site for
reloading the replicative helicase. Depending upon whether the
lagging strand is duplex or single-stranded, this step requires
DNA unwinding or remodeling of SSB-coated ssDNA, respectively.
As described above, unwinding of the lagging strand could be
accomplished by translocation of the core HD along the laggingstrand template DNA, with the CRR acting as a wedge to unwind duplex DNA (Fig. 4, Upper). For SSB/DNA remodeling,
the smFRET studies presented in Fig. 3 support a model in
which PriA acts by directly interacting with SSB bound to the
lagging strand. Formation of the PriA/SSB complex exposes
ssDNA from SSB to which PriA can then bind, leading to formation of a PriA/SSB/DNA ternary complex where PriA holds
ssDNA in preparation for reloading of the replicative DnaB
helicase. Additionally, PriA translocase activity could possibly
“push” SSB along the lagging-strand template to expose additional ssDNA to which primosome components (PriB and DnaT)
can bind and that will ultimately serve as a binding site for DnaB.
A similar “pushing” mechanism in which SSB is promoted along
DNA by a directional enzyme has been demonstrated for the
RecA recombinase in vitro (47).
Taken together, these models provide insights into the molecular mechanisms that govern the initial steps of replication
restart in bacteria. Through a combination of its structurespecific DNA-binding and unwinding properties and its ability to
manipulate SSB/DNA complexes, PriA appears to have adapted
to function on a variety of abandoned DNA replication fork
structures that could form in response to diverse challenges
during replication in cells. We speculate that these mechanistic
features allow PriA to act selectively on bona fide sites for
replication restart while avoiding the potential problems that
would arise from nonselective replication restart in other loci

Fig. 4. PriA replication restart initiation models. PriA recognizes abandoned DNA replication forks with either duplex (Upper) or SSB-bound ssDNA (Lower)
lagging strands and processes these to expose ssDNA necessary for full primosome assembly and reloading of the replicative helicase. Nascent DNA strands are
colored gray. Replisomal reassembly proceeds spontaneously after replicative helicase loading.

(44, 45) (Fig. 3B). In the absence of SSB, the labeled DNA molecule is unconstrained, which leads to a very low FRET efficiency
(efficiency of ∼0.1; Fig. 3). Our experimental conditions, which
include excess free SSB, allowed spontaneous interconversion between the SSB35 and SSB65 modes (Fig. 3B, Lower).
Interestingly, the addition of EcPriA had two effects on SSB/
DNA complexes in the smFRET assay: PriA strongly stabilized
the SSB35 binding mode over the SSB65 mode, and PriA modestly reduced the SSB35 mode FRET efficiency (Fig. 3C). These
changes are consistent with PriA exposing ssDNA (due to the
SSB65-to-SSB35 transition) and with PriA binding to the newly
exposed ssDNA, which result in the slightly lower FRET efficiency state. In a simple model of this PriA/SSB/DNA ternary
complex, PriA could associate at the single strand/duplex junction in the smFRET substrate and slide the two SSB tetramers to
the end of the ssDNA tail. Interestingly, an Arg697Ala EcPriA
variant, in which a key SSB-binding residue is neutralized, fails to
alter the SSB35/SSB65 distribution (Fig. 3C). This variant retains
DNA-binding and unwinding activities and can still alter the
FRET efficiencies of both SSB modes, suggesting that the observed modulation of SSB/DNA-binding modes is dependent
upon a functional PriA/SSB interaction and not due to differential DNA-binding abilities of the PriA variant (Fig. 3C and
Figs. S4 and S5). These data indicate that PriA complex formation with SSB induces structural changes in the SSB/DNA
complex that expose ssDNA, which can be captured by PriA. A
recent study showed that the PriC protein, which initiates a parallel replication restart pathway in E. coli and a small number
of closely related bacterial species, also preferentially stabilizes
the SSB35 mode (46). These findings suggest that SSB-binding
mode remodeling could be a general requirement for DNA
replication restart.

form minimal functional requirements that could aid in the identification of eukaryotic replication restart factors.
