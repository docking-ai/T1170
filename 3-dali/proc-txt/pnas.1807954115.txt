Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a strong oxidant capable of oxidizing
cysteinyl thiolates, yet only a few cysteine-containing proteins have
exceptional reactivity toward H2O2. One such example is the prokaryotic transcription factor OxyR, which controls the antioxidant
response in bacteria, and which specifically and rapidly reduces
H2O2. In this study, we present crystallographic evidence for the
H2O2-sensing mechanism and H2O2-dependent structural transition
of Corynebacterium glutamicum OxyR by capturing the reduced
and H2O2-bound structures of a serine mutant of the peroxidatic
cysteine, and the full-length crystal structure of disulfide-bonded
oxidized OxyR. In the H2O2-bound structure, we pinpoint the key
residues for the peroxidatic reduction of H2O2, and relate this to
mutational assays showing that the conserved active-site residues T107 and R278 are critical for effective H2O2 reduction. Furthermore, we propose an allosteric mode of structural change,
whereby a localized conformational change arising from H2O2induced intramolecular disulfide formation drives a structural
shift at the dimerization interface of OxyR, leading to overall
changes in quaternary structure and an altered DNA-binding topology and affinity at the catalase promoter region. This study
provides molecular insights into the overall OxyR transcription
mechanism regulated by H2O2.
transcription factor
X-ray structure

One protein with exceptionally high reactivity toward H2O2 is
the prokaryotic transcription factor OxyR, a member of the LysRtype transcriptional regulator (LTTR) family. LTTRs contain two
domains: an N-terminal DNA-binding domain (DBD) and a Cterminal regulatory domain (RD), responsible for sensing specific
metabolites (H2O2 in the case of OxyR). OxyR uses its H2O2reactive peroxidatic cysteine (CP) of its RD domain to sense increased H2O2 concentrations, reacting with H 2O2 at a rate of
∼105 M−1s−1 (8) and, upon intramolecular resolution of the sulfenylated CP with the resolving cysteine (CR), transduces this oxidative
signal into the transcription of H2O2-detoxifying genes, such as
catalase, and iron-chelating proteins (9–12). For many virulent
bacteria, OxyR is an important antioxidant defense regulator, as
oxyR knockouts are sensitive to oxidative stress and exhibit attenuated virulence (13–19). The sensitivity of OxyR toward H2O2 has
been exploited to create the HyPer probe, a genetically encoded
Significance
The bacterial transcription factor OxyR is a model example of a
highly sensitive and specific hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) sensor. H2O2 reduction by its active-site cysteine triggers protein
structural changes leading to an increased transcription of
antioxidant genes. By solving the crystal structures of fulllength OxyR in both reduced and oxidized states, we provide
molecular insight into these structural changes. We also present a H2O2-bound structure with a threonine activating the
peroxide, and argue that this H2O2-bound structure may be
catalytically more relevant than that seen previously in the
study of a sulfinic acid-mimic mutant of the active-site cysteine.
Finally, we discuss the commonalities and differences between
the peroxidatic mechanisms of peroxiredoxins and OxyR.

ydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a reactive oxidative species that
is generated in numerous biological processes, and there is
established evidence for its participation in cell signaling. Controlling the levels of H2O2 is essential for cellular redox homeostasis,
with the intracellular H2O2 concentration normally kept in the
nanomolar range (∼1–50 nM) (1–3). Hydrogen peroxide is a strong
oxidant that mainly targets metal centers and protein thiol groups
(1, 4). However, within thiols, there is a great gap between the
oxidation rate of most thiol groups (∼10–102 M−1s−1) and the oxidation rate of specialized protein thiols (≥105 M−1s−1), meaning
that only a handful of proteins are relevant for controlling the intracellular H2O2 levels. These proteins have additional structural
features, which lower the otherwise high-energy activation barrier
of H2O2 reduction, speeding up the otherwise slow reaction (4).
Such features have been studied in detail for peroxiredoxins
(Prdxs), where a Thr/Cys/Arg triad is mainly responsible for the
peroxidatic activity (5, 6). Both the Thr and the Arg favor the reduction of H2O2 by stabilizing the transition state and by polarizing
the O–O peroxyl bond (5). For other cases, as in the sulfurcontaining glutathione peroxidase family, a Cys/Asn/Gln/Trp tetrad is responsible for the peroxidatic activity, but the details of the
H2O2 reduction mechanism have not yet been uncovered (7). In
general, structural factors that govern thiol-based H2O2 sensing and
catalysis of H2O2 reduction are still unclear.

fluorescent biosensor that dynamically monitors physiological fluctuations in cellular H2O2 concentrations (20, 21).
The first published crystal structures of the oxidized and reduced
states of the RD of Ec-OxyR provided a model in which a ratelimiting conformational change follows CP-CR disulfide formation
(8, 22). To date, crystal structures of the OxyR RD from Escherichia
coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Vibrio vulnificus, Neisseria meningitidis, and Porphyromonas gingivalis have been published, displaying a
conserved homodimeric arrangement of RD subunits (22–26). So
far, the molecular evidence for H2O2 binding and catalysis at the
peroxidatic active site of OxyR derives from crystallographic and
biochemical studies of P. aeruginosa OxyR (Pa-OxyR). A crystal
structure of full-length Pa-OxyR, with the CP mutated to Asp, a
sulfinylated cysteine mimic, has been solved with H2O2 bound in the
active site, and mutational studies highlighted a role of the activesite residue T100 (Pa-OxyR numbering) for H2O2 reduction (23).
In this study, we focus on the catalytic and regulatory mechanisms
of a noncanonical OxyR from the actinomycete Corynebacterium
glutamicum (Cg-OxyR), which utilizes a repressor mechanism toward catalase transcription, differing from the typical E. coli OxyR
model, which uses an activator mechanism (10, 27, 28). Here, we
present the reduced, H2O2-bound, and intramolecular disulfidebonded crystal structures of Cg-OxyR, and find an altered H2O2
binding configuration with respect to the Pa-OxyR findings (23). By
combining structural data with H2O2 consumption assays of selected
site-directed mutants of OxyR, we show the critical residues for
H2O2 reduction. The structural changes following disulfide formation in Cg-OxyR point toward an allosteric mechanism that regulates
the RD homodimeric interface and translates into conformational
changes in the OxyR tetrameric assembly. Finally, we explore how
Cg-OxyR acts as a H2O2-sensing transcriptional regulator in vivo
and discuss the implications of its mode of action.
Results
Full-Length Cg-OxyR Structure Shows a Tetrameric Configuration
Differing from Previously Published Structures. The crystal struc-

ture of full-length Cg-OxyRC206S (a CP mutant, C206S, which
functionally is redox-insensitive) was solved to a resolution of 2
Å in space group P21 (Table 1). The asymmetric unit contains a
homotetramer composed of a dimer of dimers, wherein an
intradimer interface is formed between the RDs of each respective protomer, and an interdimer interface is formed between the DBDs from each dimer (Fig. 1B). The tetrameric
oligomeric state of reduced OxyR was supported by high-resolution
size-exclusion chromatography (SI Appendix, Fig. S1A). The overall
structural fold of the RD is common to that of the LTTR family,
with an N-terminal domain comprised of β-strands sandwiched
between two α-helices (subdomain 1), a bundle of β-strands and
α-helices (subdomain 2), and a C-terminal α-helix and β-strand
traversing both domains (Fig. 1C). The tetrameric conformation
of Cg-OxyRC206S differs noticeably from the tetrameric structure of
Pa-OxyR (Fig. 1A) (PDB ID code 4X6G) (23) and the putative P.
aeruginosa LTTR PA01 (PDB ID code 3FZV). Although the
interdimeric interface of the DBDs itself is conserved among the
three structures, the tetrameric configuration between the three
structures derives from a difference in the hinge bending angle
between the DBD and RD subunits. When considering the RD
homodimers of Pa-OxyR, an asymmetry in the angle between the
RD and the DBD of each subunit of the dimer is apparent.
Whereas the DBD of one subunit hinges at an ∼55–60° acute angle
relative to the connecting RD, the DBD of the other subunit hinges
at an ∼100° obtuse angle relative to the connecting RD. This
combination of acute and obtuse angle hinging of the homodimer is
reflected in the paring homodimer, which constitutes the full tetramer, therefore resulting in a “slanted” tetrameric assembly. The
subunits of the Cg-OxyRC206S structure, on the other hand, all exhibit similarly acute hinging angles between the DBD and RD of
each subunit, all with hinge angles in the range of 40–50°. This
results in a relatively more symmetric assembly of subunits within
the Cg-OxyRC206S tetramer. The hinging angle was determined by
the intersect between the midpoint and the C terminus of DBDα4,

Conserved Architecture of the OxyR Active-Site Pocket. In the crystal
structure of Cg-OxyRC206S, a sulfate molecule occupies the
peroxidatic active-site pocket. This sulfate engages in hydrogen
bonds with the side-chain hydroxyls of T107 and S206 (CP
equivalent) and the side-chain amine of H205 (Fig. 2A). A sulfate molecule is also present in the crystal structure of V. vulnificus OxyR2 (Vv-OxyR2; PDB ID codes 5B7D and 5B7H),
binding at an identical location and with the same hydrogen bond
interactions (Fig. 2A) (25). In other OxyR structures, there is a
conserved network of three water molecules within the active-site
pocket instead of a sulfate molecule (PDB ID codes 3T22, 3JV9,
and 4Y0M) (Fig. 2A) (22–26). This water pattern is conserved
among these structures due to hydrogen bond interactions with
side-chains of four conserved residues—T107, T136, H205, and
C206—in Cg-OxyR (in N. meningitidis OxyR, H205 is substituted
by Asn). Just outside of the active-site pocket, an additional conserved water molecule binds to both the side-chains of the CP (Ser
in CP-mutant) and R278, the latter of which also contributes hydrogen bonds via its guanidinium group to the oxygens of the sidechain hydroxyl and backbone carbonyl of T107, an interaction that
may play a role in stabilizing the position of T107 within the activesite architecture (Fig. 2A). Conservation of these active-site residues is demonstrated by a multiple sequence alignment of 67 OxyRs
from different families (SI Appendix, Fig. S2). In particular, the CP
and the R278 are universally conserved (SI Appendix, Fig. S2), while
T107 is present in 97% of the sequences (substituted by a serine in
the remaining 3%).

gain a peroxide-bound structure. Exposure of crystals of CgOxyRC206S to 600 mM H2O2 for 90 min enabled determination
of a crystal structure of H2O2-bound Cg-OxyRC206S (hereafter
referred to as Cg-OxyRH2O2) at a resolution of 2.6 Å in space

configuration close to that of Cg-OxyRC206S, with some minor
subunit displacement. In all four respective active-site pockets
of the Cg-OxyRH2O2 tetramer, the sulfate molecule is no longer
present, and in two of the four pockets a molecule of H2O2 and a
water molecule occupy a position equivalent to the sulfate (Fig.

peroxide-bound pockets one oxygen of H2O2 (OA) accepts a
hydrogen bond from the side-chain hydroxyl of T107 and the
backbone amide of S206, and the other peroxide oxygen (OB) is
bridged to the side-chain hydroxyl of T136 by a water molecule
(Fig. 2B). The location of the H2O2 moiety in the active-site pocket
is different to the one found in the C199D Pa-OxyR structure: in
this structure, the OA peroxide oxygen establishes hydrogen bond
contacts with the side-chain carboxyl of D199 and the side-chain
hydroxyl of T129 (T136 in Cg-OxyR) (Fig. 2B) (23). The sidechain conformation of S206 is variable between the two H2O2bound pockets, and in one pocket (hereafter referred to as “pocket
A”) is directed away from the H2O2-containing active site, whereas
in the other pocket (now referred to as “pocket B”) is directed
toward H2O2 and would be within distance for a potential thiolate
nucleophilic attack with the native cysteine (Fig. 3A).
To explore the importance of the conserved active-site residues
T107, T136, H205, C206, and R278 in peroxide reduction, singleresidue variants (T107V, T136V, H205A, C206S, R278Q) were
constructed, and H2O2 consumption was monitored in function of
time using the ferrous oxidation of xylenol orange (FOX assay),
which detects the H2O2 concentration in a given solution. While
WT Cg-OxyR consumes the majority of H2O2 within 10 s, T107V
and C206S variants are catalytically dead and only reduce minor
amounts of H2O2 (Fig. 3B). The peroxidatic activity of the R278Q
mutant is clearly affected, but not as dramatically as the T107V or
C206S variants (Fig. 3B). The T136V variant shows impairment in
H2O2 consumption to a lesser extent, and a H205A mutation has
even less of an effect (Fig. 3B). The CR, C215, is not required for
peroxidatic activity, because the C215S mutant shows no difference in H2O2 consumption compared with WT Cg-OxyR (SI
Appendix, Fig. S3). Taken together, the combination of structural
and kinetic data points to a hierarchic contribution of four activesite residues for H2O2 binding and reduction in the following
order of importance: C206, T107, R278, and T136.
Disulfide Bond Formation Reorganizes the OxyR Tetrameric Assembly.

The crystal structure of the intramolecular disulfide-bonded
form of Cg-OxyR (Cg-OxyR SS ) was solved to a resolution of
2.3 Å in space group C2 (Table 1). The asymmetric unit cell contains two protomers of OxyR forming a RD-interfacing homodimer,
which is one-half of the full tetramer related by crystallographic
symmetry (Fig. 4A). The tetrameric oligomeric state of Cg-OxyRSS
was confirmed by high-resolution size-exclusion chromatography,
with some octameric subpopulation (SI Appendix, Fig. S4A). As

with Cg-OxyRC206S, the crystallographic tetramer of Cg-OxyRSS is
a dimer of RD-interfaced homodimers with interhomodimer interactions predominating through respective DBD interfaces, although its overall tetrameric conformation differs significantly from
that of Cg-OxyRC206S (Fig. 4A). The different oligomeric configurations adopted by Cg-OxyRC206S and Cg-OxyRSS arise predominantly from an asymmetric hinge motion of the loop
connecting the DBD to the RD, resulting in a more square-like
conformation for Cg-OxyRSS compared with the more rhomboid shape of Cg-OxyRC206S, with a shortening of the distance between DBDs of an RD homodimer from ∼117 Å in
Cg-OxyRC206S to ∼96 Å in Cg-OxyRSS (Fig. 4A). Despite this
significant oligomeric rearrangement, the interprotomer DBD
interfaces are essentially conserved between the oxidized and
reduced forms of OxyR (SI Appendix, Fig. S4B).
In both protein chains of the asymmetric unit, the CP (C206) and
CR (C215) engage in a CP-CR intramolecular disulfide. This
disulfide formation is facilitated by unfolding of the RDα3 helix,
displacing the CP by 9.8 Å and CR by 7.4 Å (Cα-Cα), and resulting
in the formation of a short β-strand from C206 to H208 (Fig. 4B).
Of note, the unfolded conformation of the RDα3 helix is almost
identical to that observed in Cg-OxyRH2O2 described above (Fig.
4C). These local conformational changes induce a subtle repacking
of the hydrophobic core proximal to the peroxidatic site, causing
allosteric structural changes at the RD homodimer interface,
which translates into a cumulative 20° sliding rotation of the RD
homodimer protomers. For a more in-depth discussion of the
structural factors governing the localized conformational changes
upon oxidation of Cg-OxyR, see SI Appendix.
H2O2 Induces Rapid Intersubunit Rotation. The single Trp of CgOxyR, W258, is located at the RD dimerization interface and
shows a side-chain flip upon Cg-OxyR oxidation (Fig. 5A), which
causes a decrease in the Trp-intrinsic fluorescence (Fig. 5B).
This fluorescence decrease can be reverted upon addition of the
reducing agent DTT (Fig. 5B). Motivated by this observation, we
used the fluorescent read-out for a stopped-flow kinetic study.
Upon H2O2 exposure, a rapid exponential fluorescence decrease
was observed for WT Cg-OxyR RD (Fig. 5C). The C206S variant, which is peroxidatically inert, has almost no fluorescence
decrease, while the C215S variant, which is peroxidatically active,
shows a fluorescence decrease but lower than for WT Cg-OxyR
(Fig. 5C). This further supports a mechanism in which CP-CR
disulfide formation is required to lock the RD intersubunit

Fig. 3. C206, T107, and R278 are the crucial residues for H2O2 catalysis. (A) In the crystal structure of Cg-OxyRH2O2, an H2O2 molecule occupies the active-site
pocket in two of the four chains present in the asymmetric unit. Displayed is one of the two the H2O2 binding environments, termed pocket A (see Crystallographic and Kinetic Evidence for H2O2 Binding and Reduction). Here, the side-chain of S206 is directed away from the active site, whereas in pocket B, the
side-chain of S206 is directed into the active site. Both conformations are displayed here, with a double-headed arrow indicating the rotameric change. The
hydrogen-bonding network between H2O2, two conserved water molecules, and residues of the active site is expressed in terms of interatomic distances. (B)
Mutation of the active-site residues impairs H2O2 reduction and supports the crystallographic data. WT Cg-OxyR and mutant variants (C206S, T107V, T136V,
H205A, R278Q) were mixed with an equimolar amount of H2O2, and the H2O2 concentration was monitored in function of time with the FOX assay reagent.
The lines correspond to single exponential fittings of the H2O2 consumption (n = 3). The error bars correspond to SD.

3B). For the R278Q variant, we were unable to determine the
second-order rate constant via this approach. As an alternative,
we used the FOX assay with a fixed H2O2 concentration while
varying the concentration of R278Q Cg-OxyR. The H2O2 consumption profile followed a single exponential decrease, and the
observed rate constant was linearly proportional to the concentration of R278Q Cg-OxyR (SI Appendix, Fig. S5), yielding a
second-order rate constant of (1.79 ± 0.12) × 102 M−1s−1. A
summary of the rate constants can be found in Table 2. Overall,
Cg-OxyR exhibits a rapid conformational change upon oxidation,
which is slowed by replacement of the conserved activesite residues.
Disulfide-Bonded Cg-OxyR Shifts Its DNA-Binding Pattern at the
Catalase Regulatory Region. Contrary to the conventional E. coli

model of OxyR as a transcriptional activator, the OxyRs of Corynebacterium diphtheriae and C. glutamicum are thought to act
as transcriptional repressors (27, 29). It has been demonstrated
that the oxidized, intramolecular disulfide-bonded form of CgOxyR is less specific in its binding to the four promoter regions,
katA, dps, ftn, and cydA relative to reduced Cg-OxyR, and that
in vivo bacterial exposure to H2O2 leads to induction of katA
and dps, but not ftn and cydA (27). We aimed to assess the

rotation in Cg-OxyR, leading to a side-chain flip of W258. The
progress curve for WT Cg-OxyR fits with an equation for a
single exponential decay (Fig. 5D), and the observed rate
constants of the progress curves correlate with the H2O2
concentration in a hyperbolic manner (Fig. 5D). Fitting the
data to a hyperbolic equation [kobs = ([E0]kcat[H2O2])/(KM +
[H2O2])] gives a kcat of 105.7 s−1 and a KM of 2.56 mM,
resulting in a kcat/KM of 4.2 × 104 M−1s−1. Using the same approach, we also evaluated the kinetic impact on the T136V and
H205A variants. These mutants did not show a single exponential fluorescence decrease upon H2O2 addition, but instead gave
a single exponential increase in fluorescence, which, for the
H205A variant, was preceded by a rapid decrease in fluorescence
(SI Appendix, Fig. S5). It is possible that these mutations slightly
reposition W258, which upon H2O2 addition affects the overall
protein intrinsic fluorescence. For both H205A and T136V
mutants, the observed rate constants of the fluorescence increase
are linearly proportional to the H2O2 concentration (SI Appendix, Fig. S5). From the slope of the linear curve, a second-order
rate constant for the reaction with H2O2 was obtained, yielding a
rate of (1.06 ± 0.1) × 104 M−1s−1 for H205A and (5.18 ± 0.19) ×
102 M−1s−1 for T136V (SI Appendix, Fig. S5), which is in good
agreement with the results obtained from the FOX assay (Fig.

relationship between the oxidation state of Cg-OxyR and its
ability to bind to the catalase (katA) operator/promoter region.
Using EMSA, we found that both oxidized and reduced Cg-OxyR
bind to the catalase operator/promoter region, and this with no
apparent difference in the electrophoretic mobility of the CgOxyR-DNA complex (SI Appendix, Fig. S6A). We found that
only the DBDs bind to the katA regulatory region, because a CgOxyR RD-only variant does not show any interaction (SI Appendix, Fig. S6B). Next, to determine the exact Cg-OxyR binding
region, we performed DNase I footprinting experiments, and
observed that reduced Cg-OxyR protects a section corresponding
to approximately four consecutive helical turns, which includes
the −10 promoter element and the transcription start point (Fig.
6A). On the other hand, disulfide-bonded Cg-OxyR retained
binding to the −10 promoter element, but the last two helical
turns were no longer protected from the DNase I treatment
(Fig. 6A). The Cg-OxyRC206S variant protected the same katA
regulatory region as reduced WT Cg-OxyR, whereas reduced
CR mutant (Cg-OxyRC215S) displayed slightly less protection of
the binding region in comparison with reduced WT or CgOxyRC206S (Fig. 6A). Treatment of Cg-OxyRC215S with H2O2
causes a uniform decrease of protection on the whole binding
region, whereas protection by H2O2-treated Cg-OxyRC206S was
unaffected (Fig. 6A).
To determine the affinity of the Cg-OxyR variants toward the
protected region of the katA promoter, we measured binding to a 6carboxyfluorescein (6-FAM)–labeled katA promoter oligonucleotide
by fluorescence polarization, whereby binding of OxyR to the oligonucleotide increases the fluorescence polarization. Reduced WT
Cg-OxyR, and reduced and H2O2-treated Cg-OxyRC206S gave similar affinities (∼40 nM) for the oligonucleotide and bound with
strong positive cooperativity (h = 2.6–2.8) (Fig. 6B), whereas oxidized WT Cg-OxyR had a fourfold lower binding affinity (∼160 nM)
E11628 | www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1807954115

with almost no cooperativity (h = 1.2) (Fig. 6B). Isothermal titration
calorimetry of the interaction between Cg-OxyR and the katA promoter showed that binding of the katA promoter to reduced CgOxyR occurs with a higher affinity than that observed for binding to
oxidized Cg-OxyR, and displays an initial exothermic binding step
not observed for oxidized Cg-OxyR (SI Appendix, Fig. S6C).
Next, to identify the nitrogenous bases of the katA promoter
that are directly involved in the binding to reduced and/or oxidized Cg-OxyR, missing contact probing experiments were performed. These experiments involve addition of Cg-OxyR to
sparingly modified depurinated/depyrimidinated DNA (on average one modification per molecule), followed by separation of
the free DNA and protein-bound forms on an acrylamide gel,
cleavage of the DNA backbone at the modified positions, and
separation of the reaction products by gel electrophoresis under
denaturing conditions. If a base is essential to Cg-OxyR binding,
DNA molecules missing this base will be underrepresented in the
bound DNA form and overrepresented in the free DNA form
(30). Initially, the missing contact probing was tested with oxidized WT Cg-OxyR and with the redox-insensitive C206S variant,
Cg-OxyRC206S. However, it was observed that the complex between
Cg-OxyRC206S and DNA gave a totally different electrophoretic mobility
pattern on the acrylamide gel compared with the WT Cg-OxyR–DNA

complex (SI Appendix, Fig. S6D), and so for this reason we decided not to use the Cg-OxyRC206S variant for this experiment.
For reduced WT Cg-OxyR, we found two binding regions, each
11- to 13-nucleotides long and separated by 6 nucleotides (SI Appendix, Fig. S7). Both reduced and oxidized Cg-OxyR specifically
bound the upstream binding region, which contains the −10 promoter element, and is immediately upstream of the transcription
start point, but the oxidized form of Cg-OxyR was no longer able
to specifically interact with the downstream binding region (SI
Appendix, Fig. S7).
Cg-OxyR Is a Repressive Gatekeeper of Catalase Expression. Because
Cg-OxyR binds to the catalase regulatory region in a manner
dependent on its oxidation state, we explored the C. glutamicum
response to H2O2 stress by evaluating the regulation of catalase
transcription. Under basal conditions, a ΔoxyR strain of C. glutamicum displayed a massive increase of the katA mRNA levels, ∼20Pedre et al.

Discussion
The generation of reactive oxidants is key for the defense of the
host against pathogenic invasion. As the frontline sensor and
coordinator of the bacterial response to the oxidant H2O2, OxyR
drives the survival of many pathogenic organisms (9–12, 14–19).
Its efficacy of defensive coordination depends on the ability to
sense intracellular H2O2 before it reaches a concentration that
inhibits bacterial growth (1, 3).
Here we show that the H2O2-sensing capacity of OxyR relies
mainly on three conserved residues (T107/C206/R278 in Cg-OxyR),
and that water molecules in the active-site pocket likely play a
supplementary role in proton transfer. We find a conserved water
placement among the peroxidatic pockets of multiple OxyRs, and a
close match between the location of conserved waters and the respective positions of the OA and OB in the H2O2-bound structure
(5). Because the CP of both OxyR and Prdx facilitate peroxide
reduction at rates several orders-of-magnitude greater than that for
a typical protein thiol, key insights can be gained from comparison
of the contribution of the respective residues in active-site environments (Fig. 8). In both cases, hydrogen-bonding interactions are
predominantly formed at OA over OB, and whereas the CP thiolate

fold higher than in the WT strain, indicating that Cg-OxyR represses katA transcription (Fig. 7A and SI Appendix, Table S2). In
agreement with this, complementation of ΔoxyR with overexpressed
WT Cg-OxyR (which displays an ∼20-fold increase of the oxyR
mRNA level) (SI Appendix, Table S3) led to a great decrease in
katA expression (as expected), equivalent to the one described for
the WT strain (Fig. 7A and SI Appendix, Table S2). In contrast,
complementation with C206S or C215S oxyR increased katA expression compared with the WT strain (∼two- to fourfold) (Fig. 7A
and SI Appendix, Table S2).
We also evaluated the fluctuations of katA mRNA levels in
response to externally applied H2O2 for the same strains ±
complementation. In all cases, katA expression increases 10 min
after a H2O2 bolus, although the degree of increase in expression
varied greatly depending on the strain/complementation, with the
WT strain giving an 8-fold up-regulation, the ΔoxyR strain a 2.5fold up-regulation, and the ΔoxyR with WT oxyR complementation a 2.2-fold up-regulation, having the lowest katA mRNA levels
upon H2O2 treatment (Fig. 7B and SI Appendix, Table S2). On the
other hand, a ΔoxyR strain with C206S/C215S oxyR complementation exhibited an ∼threefold increase (albeit nonsignificant) of
katA up-regulation under H2O2 stress (Fig. 7B and SI Appendix,
Table S2). After 30 min of H2O2 stress, the katA mRNA levels
returned to basal levels in strains containing WT OxyR (WT,
ΔoxyR + WT oxyR), while the other strains still maintained increased katA expression (Fig. 7B and SI Appendix, Table S2).
The bacterial fitness of each strain against oxidative stress was
also assessed. It has been previously reported that during the
latency (“lag”) phase of bacterial growth, genes of the oxyR
regulon are up-regulated (31), bacteria are more sensitive to H2O2
(31), and the presence or supplementation of catalase to the
growth media shortens this lag phase (3, 32). Consistent with this
finding, the ΔoxyR strain, which overexpresses catalase, shows a
shorter lag phase compared with the oxyR-containing strains (Fig.
7C). In accordance with previous studies (10, 27) we also observed
an increase of resistance against exogenous H2O2 in the ΔoxyR
strain (Fig. 7D). Complementation with overexpressed WT CgOxyR renders the strain more sensitive to H2O2, while complementation with C206S oxyR gives the second-most resistant phenotype (after ΔoxyR), and complementation with C215S oxyR has
no effect (Fig. 7D). We also evaluated the in vivo H2O2-consumption kinetics of C. glutamicum upon application of a H2O2
bolus (8 or 40 mM). For both tested concentrations, the WT strain
was the slowest in consuming H2O2, followed by the ΔoxyR +
C215S oxyR and ΔoxyR + C206S oxyR strains (Fig. 7E). Strains
lacking OxyR or complemented with overexpressed WT Cg-OxyR
were the fastest in scavenging single doses of H2O2 (Fig. 7E). All
in all, these results indicate that catalase up-regulation allows C.
glutamicum to survive persistent oxidative conditions.

of Prdx is stabilized by hydrogen bond donation from an arginine
guanidinium group, we propose that in OxyR this hydrogen bond
instead comes from a water molecule bridging R278 and Q210.
For both Prdx and OxyR, a conserved Thr plays a critical role in
providing a hydrogen bond to the peroxide OA (Fig. 8; see SI
Appendix for further discussion of the molecular architecture of
H2O2 binding in Cg-OxyRH2O2). Our study shows the essential
nature of T107 hydroxyl group for H2O2 reduction by Cg-OxyR,
a finding supported by the previous observation that a T100V
(equivalent to T107 in Cg-OxyR) but not a T100S mutation in
Pa-OxyR induces cellular H2O2 hypersensitivity (23). In CgOxyR, mutating R278 also impairs H2O2 reduction, and we
postulate that R278 scaffolds the active-site architecture by
correctly positioning T107 for its catalytic role (Fig. 8). Based on
these results, we propose that OxyR possess a core triad (T/C/R)
for H2O2 reduction.
Following reduction of H2O2 at the CP of OxyR, unfolding of
the RDα3 helix is required to bring the CP-SOH and CR into
close proximity for condensation to a CP-CR disulfide. In the
crystal structure of Cg-OxyRH2O2, two of the four active sites of
the tetramer are apo with the RDα3 unfolded, placing S206 in a
position equivalent to the disulfide-engaged C206 (Fig. 4C). This
shows that Cg-OxyR can adopt a locally unfolded state without the
prerequisite of CP sulfenylation, and a similar observation has
been made in the structure of C199D Pa-OxyR (23). In Prdxs, a
local unfolding of the CP environment is a well-known phenomenon, and it is associated with an inherent equilibrium between
the fully-folded (FF) and locally-unfolded (LU) conformations of
the active site (33). Our data suggest that the OxyR CP environment is also subject to FF/LU conformational dynamics, and it is
very likely that a FF/LU equilibrium regulates the peroxidatic
power of OxyR and susceptibility to CP hyperoxidation. Active-site

conformational dynamics have also been observed in a comparative study of Vv-OxyR1 and Vv-OxyR2 (25). Whereas in the majority of OxyRs, the active site His (H205 in C. glutamicum and
V. vulnificus) is preceded by a Gly (G204), in Vv-OxyR2 this Gly is
substituted with a Glu (G204E), which is proposed to reduce the
conformational flexibility of the active site. Due to this active-site
rigidity, Vv-OxyR2 reduces H2O2 twofold faster than its counterpart Vv-OxyR1 (which contains G204), but it is more susceptible
to CP hyperoxidation (25). Despite sharing no conserved structural

Methods
Crystallization and X-Ray Diffraction. All crystals of Cg-OxyR were obtained
using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method at 283 K. Cg-OxyRC206S was
crystallized by mixing 1.5 μL of protein [3 mg mL−1 in 20 mM Tris·HCl, pH 8.0,
500 mM NaCl, and 2 mM Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP)] with 1.5 μL
of 25% PEG 4000, 0.1 M 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (Mes), pH 6.2,
0.125 M lithium sulfate, 3% 1,6-hexanediol, and 2 mM TCEP. Crystals were
cryoprotected by addition of 16% ethylene glycol, 10% glycerol, 10% propanediol, and 2 mM TCEP and flash-frozen. Diffraction data were collected
at the PROXIMA-2A beamline of SOLEIL synchrotron at 100 K and a wavelength of 0.98 Å.
To obtain a H2O2-bound protein crystal, 1.65 μL of artificial mother liquor
containing an increased concentration of PEG (30% PEG 4000, 0.1 M Mes, pH 6.2,
0.125 M lithium sulfate) was added to a ∼3.3 μL crystallization droplet of
OxyRC206S, prepared as described above, followed by direct addition of 0.5 μL
6.6 M H2O2 (to give a final [H2O2] of ∼600 mM) and incubated at 283 K for
90 min. Crystals were flash-frozen and diffraction data collected at beamline
I24 of the Diamond Light Source synchrotron at 100 K and a wavelength of 1.0 Å.
Crystals of Cg-OxyRSS were obtained by mixing 1.5 μL of protein (2.5 mg
mL−1) with 1.5 μL of 13% PEG 4000, 0.1 M sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, 0.1 M
magnesium acetate and 10 mM β-Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydrate. Crystals were cryoprotected by addition of 20% ethylene glycol, 15%
sucrose, and 15% 3-(1-Pyridinio)-1-propanesulfonate and flash-frozen. Diffraction data were collected at the ID30B beamline of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility at 100 K and a wavelength of 0.954 Å.
All diffraction data reduction was performed in XDS (36) and merging of
intensities in AIMLESS (37). Phases for OxyRC206S were determined by molecular replacement using Phaser (38) with full-length P. aeruginosa C199D
OxyR (PDB ID code 4X6G) as a search model (23), and the full-length model
or RD homodimer of OxyRC206S used as a search model in molecular replacement for OxyRH2O2 and OxyRSS respectively. Atomic coordinates were
manually corrected in COOT (39), and the final maximum-likelihood refinement performed in PHENIX (40). Molecular geometry was validated using MolProbity (41), and the Ramachandran outliers for OxyRC206S, OxyRH2O2,
and OxyRSS were 0.08%, 0.17%, and 0% respectively. X-ray data collection
and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. For a discussion of ligand assignment/fitting to residual density, we direct readers to the SI Appendix. All structural figures were prepared in PyMOL. Oligomeric assemblies
of crystal structures were verified using PISA (42).
Methods describing stopped-flow analysis, FOX assay, DNA-binding experiments, generation of mutant strains, transcriptional analysis, and in vivo
resistance to H2O2 are described in detail in SI Appendix, Supplemental

dependent associations with cognate DNA. With in-depth crystallographic and biochemical analyses, we uncovered the molecular
mechanism of hydrogen peroxide sensing by OxyR. OxyR employs
a disulfide-driven allosteric structural change at its RD interface.
The obtained structural and mechanistic insights might further
steer the design of H2O2-sensing inhibitors and guide the optimization of a new generation of HyPer-like redox biosensors.

features, it is intriguing to see that both OxyR and Prdx adopted a
similar structural dynamic mechanism.
Here we report a significant rearrangement of the tetrameric
assembly of Cg-OxyR upon oxidation, yet with localized structural
change restricted to the RD subunits only, and the DBDs remaining
unaltered in conformation. The observed shortening of the distance
between respective DBD dimer pairs of the oxidized tetramer relative to the reduced form validates the previously hypothesized
mechanistic models of oxidative regulation of OxyR in its capacity
as a transcription factor (23, 34). See SI Appendix for a hypothesis of
how localized structural changes upon CP-CR formation in Cg-OxyR
drive the transition between the reduced and oxidized tetrameric
assemblies. Importantly, these structural changes that occur upon
Cg-OxyR oxidation translate into changes in DNA binding topology
and affinity. We show that in the absence of oxidizing stimuli, CgOxyR binds to the catalase promoter/operator region at two distinct
binding sites upstream and downstream of the katA transcription
start point. Upon oxidation, Cg-OxyR loses its interaction with the
downstream binding site, and this is further reflected by a reduction
in overall affinity and allosteric cooperativity of the binding association between oxidized OxyR and the katA promoter. This is
opposite to what has been found for the redox-dependent binding
of Ec-OxyR to the katA regulatory region, where the binding affinity increases upon oxidation (34). Although Cg-OxyR oxidation
causes loss of binding to the second site, the electrophoretic mobility of the Cg-OxyR–DNA complex is not affected by its redox
state (SI Appendix, Fig. S6A), thereby indicating that the same
number of Cg-OxyR subunits is associated with the katA regulatory
region, regardless of its oxidation state. Furthermore, the decrease
in binding cooperativity under reducing conditions suggests that the
four DBDs of the Cg-OxyR tetramer bind to the katA regulatory
region (two in each binding region), whereas Cg-OxyR oxidation
causes a conformational change that leads to the dissociation of two
DBDs from the downstream binding region. Because oxidized CgOxyR still binds to the −10 promoter element of katA, we can
expect a positive interaction between oxidized Cg-OxyR and the
RNA polymerase, whereas the extended contacts made with reduced Cg-OxyR might inhibit transcription initiation.
C. glutamicum strains lacking OxyR are more resistant to H2O2
stress, due to catalase derepression (10, 27). Catalase levels are
required to survive H2O2 stress, as demonstrated in C. glutamicum
and C. diphtheriae strains lacking katA, which are hypersensitive to
H2O2 (27, 29). We confirm that catalase up-regulation not only
improves resistance against elevated H2O2 concentrations, but
also shortens the growth lag phase and increases the rate of H2O2
consumption. The strain of C. glutamicum overexpressing CgOxyR (ΔoxyR + WT Cg-oxyR) exhibits the lowest catalase levels
and the lowest survival to sustained H2O2 stress. Under resting
conditions, both WT and Cg-OxyR–overexpressing strains show
similar repression of katA transcription, but under H2O2 treatment, the strain overexpressing Cg-OxyR exhibits even lower katA
mRNA levels, as others have previously observed (27). This likely
explains the increased sensitivity of this strain to H2O2 stress.
Despite all this, the strain overexpressing Cg-OxyR has one of the
highest H2O2 scavenging rates after a single H2O2 bolus. An explanation for this behavior is that OxyR itself is rapidly consuming
H2O2, thereby acting as a kind of short-term scavenger. However,
OxyR is not a real H2O2 scavenger, as the rereduction kinetics of
OxyR are too slow to maintain a defense response during prolonged oxidative stress conditions. A H2O2 bolus in E. coli and
V. vulnificus causes OxyR oxidation in 30 s, but it takes 5–10 min
