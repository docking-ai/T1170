The Shieldin complex, composed of REV7, SHLD1, SHLD2, and SHLD3,
protects DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) to promote nonhomologous end joining. The AAA+ ATPase TRIP13 remodels Shieldin to regulate DNA repair pathway choice. Here we report crystal structures of
human SHLD3–REV7 binary and fused SHLD2–SHLD3–REV7 ternary
complexes, revealing that assembly of Shieldin requires fused SHLD2–
SHLD3 induced conformational heterodimerization of open (O-REV7)
and closed (C-REV7) forms of REV7. We also report the cryogenic
electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of the ATPγS-bound fused
SHLD2–SHLD3–REV7–TRIP13 complexes, uncovering the principles underlying the TRIP13-mediated disassembly mechanism of the Shieldin
complex. We demonstrate that the N terminus of REV7 inserts into
the central channel of TRIP13, setting the stage for pulling the unfolded N-terminal peptide of C-REV7 through the central TRIP13 hexameric channel. The primary interface involves contacts between the
safety-belt segment of C-REV7 and a conserved and negatively
charged loop of TRIP13. This process is mediated by ATP hydrolysistriggered rotatory motions of the TRIP13 ATPase, thereby resulting in
the disassembly of the Shieldin complex.

NA double-strand breaks (DSBs) represent one of the most
damaging lesions to the integrity of double helical DNA (1).
DSBs are repaired either by error-prone nonhomologous end
joining (NHEJ) or by error-free homology-directed repair (HDR)
(2). The decision-making point controlling these two DSB repair
pathways involves the initiation of DNA termini resection (3, 4).
Briefly, the tumor suppressor BRCA1 promotes HDR by enhancing
DNA end resection, since HDR requires 3′ DNA overhangs (5). By
contrast, a chromatin-binding protein 53BP1 counteracts DSB resection and facilitates NHEJ that requires unresected DNA ends
(6–8). How 53BP1 suppresses DSB resection has long been enigmatic, but recent studies have highlighted the contribution of the
53BP1–RIF1–Shieldin pathway to this process (9, 10). The Shieldin
complex acts as the key downstream effector of 53BP1; it not only
binds and shields single-stranded DNA ends but also mediates
CST- and Polα-dependent fill-ins of DNA breaks (10–14). Notably, loss-of-function mutations of Shieldin alleviate the HDR defect of BRCA1-mutated cells, thereby restoring resistance to
poly(ADP ribose) polymerase inhibition (PARPi) (13–16). Thus,
elucidation of mechanistic insights into the role of the Shieldin
complex is essential to combat chemotherapeutic resistance and to
uncover anticancer drug targets.
Human Shieldin consists of four subunits, REV7 (also known
as MAD2L2 or MAD2B, 211 residues), SHLD1 (205 residues),
SHLD2 (835 residues), and SHLD3 (250 residues) (14). As the
first identified member of the Shieldin complex (17, 18), REV7
is composed entirely of a HORMA domain, acting as an interaction module in a broad array of cellular pathways (19–22).
SHLD3 and REV7 form a proximal subcomplex working as a

localization module in the 53BP1–RIF1–REV7 axis (13). SHLD2
is the scaffold that bridges SHLD3–REV7 and SHLD1, as well as
binds single-stranded DNA ends via its C-terminal oligonucleotide/
oligosaccharide-binding fold (OB-fold) domain (23–25). Recently, a
crystal structure of the SHLD3 fragment–REV7(R124A) binary
complex confirms that monomeric REV7 capitalizes on its stereotypical “safety belt,” a common structural feature of HORMA family
proteins, to encircle SHLD3 (26). Further, another crystal structure
of Rev7 bound to fragments of SHLD2 and SHLD3 has provided
insights into the assembly of this Shieldin trimeric subcomplex (27).
Of note, a recent report identified that AAA+ ATPase TRIP13 is a
negative regulator of Shieldin (28). TRIP13 forms a hexamer to drive
the REV7-mediated disassembly of Shieldin in an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent manner, thereby releasing the DSB DNA
ends for resection to promote HDR (29–31). The overexpression of
TRIP13 causes PARPi resistance and correlates with poor survival of
patients (28, 32). Thus, disrupting the Shieldin–TRIP13 interaction
represents an ideal strategy to potentiate the clinical effectiveness of
PARPi (28, 33).
As part of our effort to decipher the molecular mechanisms of
assembly and TRIP13-mediated remodeling of the human Shieldin
complex, we have solved X-ray and cryogenic electron microscopy
(cryo-EM) structures of a series of Shieldin complexes of increasing
size and complexity, culminating in the complex of Rev7, a fused
Significance
We report on X-ray and cryo-EM structural studies on the assembly
of the human Shieldin complex composed of SHLD2, SHLD3, and
REV7, as well as its complex with bound TRIP13 toward understanding the principles underlying TRIP13-mediated disassembly of
Shieldin. Our studies identify a conformational heterodimeric
alignment of open (O) and closed (C) conformers of REV7 when
bound to a fused SHLD2–SHLD3 construct. The AAA+ ATPase TRIP13
captures the N terminus of C-REV7 (REVNT) within its central hexameric channel, with the rotatory motion associated with sequential ATP hydrolysis within individual TRIP13 subunits. This facilitates
the stepwise pulling of the REV7NT through the central channel,
resulting in initial disassembly of C-REV7 followed by dissociation of
the Shieldin complex.

respectively, and details are listed in the figure captions.
Interestingly, the structure of the SHLD3s–REV7 monomer
complex revealed an unanticipated additional interface, termed
“site-S” (boxed region, Fig. 1D and SI Appendix, Fig. S3A), where
the hydrophobic residue cluster (38-FIPWF-42) of SHLD3 wraps
over the surface of the REV7 β-sheet region (composed of β4 to
β6, β8′, and β8′′), with details of intermolecular contacts listed in
the captions to Fig. 1 E and F.

SHLD2–SHLD3 fragment and TRIP13. Our studies highlight the
principles underlying how TRIP13 facilitates the disassembly of
REV7 in the context of the SHLD2–SHLD3–REV7 complex.
Crystal Structure of the SHLD335–58–REV7 Monomer Complex. To investigate the initial step in the assembly of Shieldin, we first
generated a complex by coexpressing full-length REV7 (R124A
mutant) and the 35- to 74-residue fragment of SHLD3 (Fig. 1A).
REV7 Arg-124 was mutated to Ala to improve crystallization, as
reported previously (34). The major peak on an S200 gel filtration
column following formation of the SHLD335–74–REV7 complex
exhibited a molar mass of 32.5 kDa measured by size-exclusion
chromatography coupled with in-line multiangle light-scattering
analysis (SEC-MALS), close to the theoretical molecular mass
(28.9 kDa) of the monomer (Fig. 1B). Attempts at crystallization
of this complex were unsuccessful. Next, we coexpressed fulllength REV7 (R124A mutant) and a fusion protein that contains SHLD3 (residues 35 to 58) and a short stabilizing REV3
sequence (residues 1887 to 1894) (labeled SHLD3s, Fig. 1A).
REV3 is the catalytic subunit of translesion DNA polymerase ζ.
REV7 acts as the accessory subunit of DNA polymerase ζ by directly binding REV3. The reported structure of the REV7–REV3
complex implied that the additional short REV3 sequence could
potentially enhance complex formation (34, 35). We then determined the crystal structure of this SHLD3s–REV7 monomer
complex at 2.7-Å resolution (Fig. 1 C and D; X-ray statistics in SI
Appendix, Table S1). There are two molecules in the asymmetric
unit (SI Appendix, Fig. S1A) and the bound SHLD3s can be
readily traced into its density in the complex (SI Appendix, Fig.
S1B).
REV7 adopts a closed conformation (designated C-REV7) in
this SHLD3s–REV7 monomer complex, such that the REV7binding motif (RBM) of SHLD3 is threaded through REV7,
revealing the typical safety-belt architecture (SI Appendix, Fig.
S2 A and B; boxed segment on SI Appendix, Fig. S1 A, Lower).

Crystal Structure of the SHLD2.3–Rev74 Complex. We attempted to

latter tetrameric complex. The structure of this SHLD2.3–Rev74

the SHLD3s–REV7 complex, it also adopts a dimeric alignment in
the structure of translesion DNA polymerase ζ (36, 37). To test
whether REV7 can adopt a dimeric alignment in its complexes
with SHLD peptides, we next designed a fusion protein containing
an SHLD2 fragment (residues 1 to 19) fused through a Gly–Ser
linker to an SHLD3 fragment (residues 1 to 58) and a C-terminal
fragment of REV3 (residues 1887 to 1894) (labeled SHLD2.3,
Fig. 2A). We observed that the SHLD2.3–REV7 complex yielded
two peaks (labeled Q1 and Q2) on a Hitrap Q column (Fig. 2B).
The fraction from peak Q1 eluted at 14.8 mL on an S200 gel
filtration column, exhibiting a molar mass of 66.7 kDa by SECMALS, indicative of formation of a SHLD2.3–Rev7 dimer complex (labeled SHLD2.3–Rev72 complex, Fig. 2C). The fraction
from peak Q2 eluted at 13.2 mL on an S200 gel filtration column,
exhibiting a molar mass of 116.9 kDa by SEC-MALS, indicative of
formation of a SHLD2.3–REV7 tetramer complex (labeled
SHLD2.3–REV74 complex, Fig. 2D). These results indicate that
the designed SHLD2.3 fusion protein can induce both dimerization and tetramerization of REV7 in solution.

complex (SI Appendix, Fig. S4A), including SHLD2 (SI Appendix,
Fig. S4B) and SHLD3 (SI Appendix, Fig. S4C). The crystallographic
asymmetric unit contains one SHLD2.3–REV74 complex composed
of a pair of REV7 conformational heterodimers connected by a pair
of head-to-head aligned SHLD2.3–SHLD2.3 β-sheets (Fig. 2 G
and H).
In each REV7 conformational heterodimer (Fig. 2 E and F), one
REV7 adopts an open (O-REV7, Fig. 3A) while the other exhibits a
closed (C-REV7, Fig. 3B) conformation. The SHLD2.3 fusion
protein serves as a strap with its N and C termini binding O-REV7
and C-REV7, respectively (Fig. 2 E and F), therby strengthening the
conformational heterodimerization of REV7. The 936 Å2 dimeric
interface between O-REV7 and C-REV7 is further mediated by
multiple intermolecular hydrophobic (Fig. 3C) and hydrogen
bonding (Fig. 3D) interactions. Notably, Arg-124 of O-REV7 forms
hydrogen bonds with Ala-135 of C-REV7, while Arg-124 of
C-REV7 forms hydrogen bonds with Glu-35 of O-REV7, highlighting the importance of Arg-124, consistent with previous reports
(27, 34).
The C-REV7 forms the typical safety-belt including an intact β8′/
β8″ hairpin (Fig. 3A), identical to that observed in the SHLD3s–
REV7 complex (Fig. 1D), while O-REV7 lacks both the safety belt
and the β8′ strand (Fig. 3B). The β1 strand of SHLD2 is positioned
between the β6 strand of O-REV7 (antiparallel alignment) and the
β1 strand of SHLD3 (parallel alignment) as shown in Fig. 2 G and
H, with this sandwiched β-sheet topology stabilized by hydrophobic
(Fig. 3E) and hydrogen bonding (Fig. 3F) interactions. The above
results provide structural insights into SHLD2–SHLD3 mediated
REV7 conformational heterodimerization involving C-REV7 and
O-REV7 subunits, which constitute an essential initial step in the
Shieldin assembly.

Reconstitution of Hexameric TRIP13 Bound to the Shieldin Complex. It
has been reported that purified AAA+ ATPase TRIP13 can dissociate SHLD3–REV7 in vitro in an ATP-dependent manner, as
evidenced by the release of REV7 from immobilized GST–SHLD3
complexes (28). We prepared a TRIP13 catalytic mutant (E253Q)
that can bind ATP/ATPγS to form a stable hexameric topology but
lacks its ATP hydrolysis activity as previously reported (29, 30)
(Fig. 4A). We next sought to reconstitute the higher-order complex
of hexameric TRIP13(E253Q) bound to the SHLD2.3–REV74
complex, which snapshots the initial recognition step of the Shieldin
complex by the TRIP13 hexamer. The incubation of purified the
SHLD2.3–REV74 and TRIP13(E253Q) hexamer with ATPγS
generates a peak eluted at 10.6 mL on an S200 gel filtration column,
whereas the TRIP13(E253Q) hexamer alone eluted at 11.7 mL on
the same S200 gel filtration column (Fig. 4B), indicative of the
formation of the SHLD2.3–REV74–TRIP13(E253Q) complex.
Sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(SDS-PAGE) analysis further confirmed that the TRIP13(E253Q)
eluted with REV7 and SHLD2.3 in a 6:4:2 stoichiometry (Fig. 4C),
consistent with the expected complex composition.
Cryo-EM Structure of TRIP13 Bound to the SHLD2.3–REV74 Complex.

We next determined the cryo-EM structure of the SHLD2.3–
REV74–TRIP13(E253Q) complex with ATPγS (hereafter designated
SHLD2.3–REV74–TRIP13 complex; cryo-EM workflow shown in SI
Appendix, Fig. S5 and cryo-EM statistics in SI Appendix, Table S2).
Refinement of the electron microscopy dataset yielded an initial
consensus reconstruction extended to an average resolution of 3.6 Å
(SI Appendix, Fig. S5 B and E), in which clear density was observed
for the TRIP13 hexamer, but less so for the SHLD2.3–REV74
component of the complex. The map showed the overall structure of
the hexameric ring of TRIP13(E253Q) (SI Appendix, Fig. S6 A and
B), that is very similar to that of the TRIP13–p31comet-substrate

final structure of such a complex is shown in an electron density
view in Fig. 4D and its ribbon counterpart in Fig. 4E. This overall
structure displays a cannon-like architecture,with the SHLD2.3–
REV74 constituting a gun barrel fixed on the convex face of the
hexameric TRIP13 gun platform. The topology of the SHLD2.3–
REV74 component is essentially the same in the crystal structure
in the absence of TRIP13 (Fig. 2 E and F) and the cryo-EM
structure with bound TRIP13 (Fig. 4 D and E). Some examples
of electron density tracing between SHLD2.3–REV74 and TRIP13
components spanning interfacial regions in the complex are shown
in SI Appendix, Fig. S7 A–D.
We also generated the SHLD2.3–REV72–TRIP13(E253Q)
with ATPγS complex (SI Appendix, Fig. S8 A and B) and collected
a cryo-EM dataset on this complex that yielded a consensus map
that extended to an average resolution of 3.7 Å (SI Appendix, Fig.
S8C). We observed clear density for the TRIP13 hexamer, but
marginal density was observed for the SHLD2.3–REV7 dimer
component of the complex, implying that the SHLD2.3–REV7
dimer did not form a stable complex with TRIP13.

hydrogen bonds with Ala-135 of C-REV7 and Glu-35 of O-REV7, respectively,
highlighting the importance of Arg-124 that is shown in previous reports.

complex (29). Within the hexameric ring of TRIP13, the topology of
A to E monomers consists of an N-terminal domain (henceforth
denoted NTD), followed by a large AAA+ domain and a C-terminal
small AAA+ domain, that are classical in the AAA+ ATPase superfamily. Monomers A to E are bound with ATPγS to form a
compact right-handed spiral topology (monomer C with bound
ATPγS shown in SI Appendix, Fig. S6C). By contrast, monomer F is
in the apo-state lacking bound ATPγS, leading to the separation of its
large and small AAA+ domains (SI Appendix, Fig. S6D), thereby
creating a seam in the hexameric ring of TRIP13. The electron
density of the NTD of monomer F is not visible, implying the dynamic feature of monomer F in the hexameric ring.
To improve the density for the SHLD2.3–REV74 component,
we then used masked local refinement to obtain a focused map at
an average resolution of 3.8 Å (SI Appendix, Fig. S5C). With this
map, the secondary structural elements and certain larger side
chains of the REV7 tetramer become discernible so that we can
dock the crystal structure of the SHLD2.3–REV74 into the significant cryo-EM density feature above the convex face of the
TRIP13 hexamer, while most of the REV7 connecting loops, as
well as a large portion of SHLD2.3 fragments were still untraceable in the density (SI Appendix, Fig. S5C). We then used the
docked model to combine the consensus and focused maps, so as
to obtain a composite map (SI Appendix, Fig. S5D) for refining the
overall structure of the SHLD2.3–REV74–TRIP13 complex. The

Previous cryo-EM structures of substrate-bound AAA+ ATPases
established that their substrates insert through the conserved central pore, thereby imposing a constriction on the bound substrate
polypeptide to eventually force the disassembly of folded topologies (38). We observe that the N terminus (residues 8 to 14, designated REV7NT) of C-REV7, which was not visible in the crystal
structure in the absence of TRIP13, becomes ordered in our cryoEM structure of the SHLD2.3–REV74–TRIP13 complex and is
threaded through the central pore of TRIP13 (Fig. 4F). A detailed
view of intermolecular contacts between the precisely inserted
Asp8 to Val14 of REV7NT and the color-coded key residues of
TRIP13 monomers A to E that constitute the central hydrophobic
pore of TRIP13 is shown in Fig. 4G. This central pore is lined by
pore loops 1 (residues 218 to 224) and 2 (residues 266 to 274)
emanating from individual subunits of the ATPase (SI Appendix,
Fig. S9). In this configuration, the highly conserved TRIP13 Trp221 and Phe-222 of pore loop 1 of monomers B to E, as well as
Pro-270 of pore loop 2 of monomers B to D embrace residues 8 to
14 of REV7NT in a ratcheted manner (Figs. 4G and 5 A and B). By
contrast, TRIP13 monomer A merely uses Ala-266, Gly-267, and
Thr-268 of its pore loop 2 residues to contact REV7NT, while no
interactions are observed between TRIP13 monomer F and
REV7NT (Fig. 4G).
Interfaces between TRIP13 and SHLD2.3–REV74. The structure of the
SHLD2.3–REV74–TRIP13 complex reveals two direct intermolecular contact surfaces between SHLD2.3–REV74 and TRIP13
components (Fig. 4 D and E). The primary interface (site-1, Fig. 4E)
involves contacts between the safety-belt segment of C-REV7 and
the conserved and negatively charged loop (110-ENLEEETENII-120; hereafter designated the poly-E loop; SI Appendix, Fig. S9)
of TRIP13 monomer B (Figs. 5C and 4 D and E). The second
contact (site-2; Fig. 4E) forms mainly between the loop 88 to 95 of
O-REV7′ and the NTD of TRIP13 monomer E (Fig. 4 D and E).
We propose that this second contact could help to reduce the
flexibility of SHLD2.3–REV74 upon TRIP13 binding, with the
potential limitation that such a contact could reflect the artificial
fusion strategy for the generation of SHLD2.3. In addition, we also
noted a potential less precisely defined intermolecular contact (site3; Fig. 4E) between loop 88 to 95 of O-REV7 and negatively
charged surface contributed by the poly-E loop of TRIP13 monomer E (Fig. 4 D and E).
Given the above-mentioned limitations of site-2 and site-3, we
focused our analysis of the site-1 interface between the C-REV7
safety belt and poly-E loop of TRIP13 monomer B (Fig. 5C). We
can trace the main chains but not the side chains of the interfacial
residues due to the blurry electron density (SI Appendix, Fig. S7B).

of TRIP13.

To test whether site-1 is essential for TRIP13-induced remodeling
of the SHLD2.3–REV74, we replaced 123-EEE-125 of TRIP13
with a triple alanine substitution to generate polyE/A mutant and
compared ATPase activity of wild-type and mutated TRIP13 for
remodeling of the SHLD2.3–REV74. As shown in Fig. 5D, the
ATPase activity was reduced in the polyE/A mutant, showing that
the negatively charged segment in the poly-E loop is important for
TRIP13 function. To test the importance of the REV7 safety-belt
sequence, we prepared three alanine substitution mutants of REV7
spanning safety-belt interfacial basic residues (R153A, R158A/
N159A, and K165A). These individual sets of REV7 mutations
resulted in a clear reduction in the efficacy of the ATPase activity of
wild-type TRIP13 (Fig. 5D). These mutagenesis data confirm that
TRIP13’s ATPase activity is tightly coupled to engagement of site-1
interactions.
Cryo-EM Analysis of TRIP13(E253Q) Bound to the SHLD2L.3-REV7 Dimer
Complex. The β1 strand of SHLD2 (residues 1 to 19) is sandwiched

by the β6 strand of O-REV7 and the N-terminal β1 strand of
SHLD3 in our crystal structure of the fused SHLD2.3–REV74
complex (Fig. 2 G and H and SI Appendix, Fig. S10A). A crystal
structure has also been reported recently of the SHLD2(residues 1

to 52)–SHLD3(residues 1 to 64)–REV7 dimer complex (27). In
this structure, SHLD2(residues 1 to 52) forms an additional
β-hairpin (β2 and β3) to further sandwich the β1 strand of SHLD3 in
the ternary complex (SI Appendix, Fig. S10B). Accordingly, we decided to replace the SHLD2(residues 1 to 19) of SHLD2.3 by its
longer counterpart SHLD2L(residues 1 to 50), to generate fused
SHLD2L.3 containing SHLD2L(residues 1 to 50) and a longer
SHLD3(residues 1 to 74) linked components (Fig. 6A). We observed
that such a fused SHLD2L.3–REV7 complex yielded one single
peak on a Hitrap Q column and subsequently eluted at 14.8 mL on
an S200 gel filtration column (SI Appendix, Fig. S10C), indicative of
the formation of a stable SHLD2L.3–REV7 dimer complex (hereafter labeled SHLD2L.3–REV72). It should be noted that we did not
observe the formation of the SHLD2L.3–REV74 complex during
purification.
We then reconstituted the SHLD2L.3–REV72–TRIP13(E253Q)
complex (Fig. 6B) for cryo-EM analysis, with the cryo-EM data
work flow shown in SI Appendix, Fig. S11 A and B. Threedimensional (3D) classification indicated that the component of
SHLD2L.3–REV72 exhibited substantial conformational flexibility, with its position tilting or twisting by as much as 30° relative to
the TRIP13 hexameric ring (Fig. 6 C and D and SI Appendix, Fig.

identified by the PockDrug server (SI Appendix, Fig. S3C), implying the potential for druggability of site-S. Since disrupting of
the REV7–REV1 interaction can inhibit mutagenic translesion
synthesis (TLS) and reduce chemoresistance (41), such a twocomponent pocket scaffold (adjacent site-S and REV1-binding
site) spanning the REV7 surface could represent an attractive
future avenue for improving DNA-damaging chemotherapeutics
by simultaneously inhibiting error-prone NHEJ and TLS.

S11B). We did not observe such flexibility in the structure of the
SHLD2.3–REV74–TRIP13 complex, perhaps due to its additional
site-2 interface that packs with and stabilizes the interaction
with the TRIP13 hexamer (Fig. 4 D and E). Refinement of the
3D classes yielded three consensus maps that extended to average resolutions of 3.9 to 4.1 Å (SI Appendix, Fig. S11B). We noticed that the SHLD2L.3–REV72 component in the class 1
SHLD2L.3–REV72–TRIP13 complex (Fig. 6 C and D) shares a
similar conformation with the SHLD2.3–REV74 component in
the SHLD2.3–REV74–TRIP13 complex (Fig. 4 D and E). We
refrained from building models of classes 1 to 3 of the
SHLD2L.3–REV72–TRIP13 complex due to difficulties of peptide tracing into the low-resolution observed densities (SI Appendix, Fig. S11B).
Discussion
Drugability of Site-S on the Rev7 β-Sheet Scaffold. Given that interactions involving the safety-belt segment of the SHLD346–74
–REV7 monomer complex have been highlighted in a recent
study of its structure complemented with mutational studies on
key intermolecular contacts (26), we do not address related results observed in our study of the SHLD335–54–REV7 monomer
complex (Fig. 1). We instead focus on a discussion of the potential of targeting site-S (SI Appendix, Fig. S3A) as a therapeutic
intervention strategy between REV7 and its binding partners
(39–41). In contrast to the safety-belt region (SI Appendix, Fig.
S3B) that binds multiple partners (34, 35, 42, 43), site-S, which
overlays with the REV1-binding site (SI Appendix, Fig. S3D) has
sufficient complexity, making it ideal for small molecule drug
design toward attempts to disrupt the Shieldin/NEHJ pathway.
In addition, the site-S interface (SI Appendix, Fig. S3A) shares
one pocket with the adjacent REV1-binding site (42, 44, 45) (SI
Appendix, Fig. S3D) and another adjacent one with a pocket

In the current study, we report on several structures of fused
SHLD2–SHLD3 bound to REV7 in the absence and presence of
TRIP13. In one set that includes the X-ray structure of
SHLD2.3–REV74 (Fig. 2 E and F) and the cryo-EM structure of
SHLD2.3–REV74–TRIP13 complex (Fig. 4 D and E), each
contain a pair of C-REV7–O-REV7 conformational heterodimers to generate a tetrameric alignment. On the other hand,
the cryo-EM structure of the SHLD2L.3–REV72–TRIP13 complex contains only a single C-REV7–O-REV7 conformational
heterodimer (Fig. 6 C and D). We anticipate that REV7 tetramerization reflects the short SHLD2(residues 1 to 19) segment
used in the fused SHLD2.3 construct (SI Appendix, Fig. S10A),
which on replacement by the longer SHLD2L(residues 1 to 52)
in the SHLD2L.3 construct would disrupt the tetramerization
interface due to the presence of additional β2 and β3 segments of
SHLD2 (SI Appendix, Fig. S10B). Thus, we anticipate that the
functional complex most likely contains a single C-REV7–
O-REV7 conformational heterodimer mediated by bound SHLD2
and SHLD3. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the
tetramer complex could also be physiologically relevant.
Positioning of the C-REV7–O-REV7 Conformational Heterodimer on
the TRIP13 Hexamer on Complex Formation. We observe that the

C-REV7 component of the C-REV7–O-REV7 conformational
heterodimer is anchored on the TRIP13 surface primarily as a result
of insertion of the C-REV7NT into the central pore of the TRIP13
hexamer channel (Figs. 4 D and E and 6 C and D). By contrast the
O-REV7 component exhibits flexibility in the SHLD2L.3–
REV72–TRIP13 complex as reflected in twist and tilt alignments for
this segment (Fig. 6 C and D). Such flexibility is limited in the
structure of the SHLD2.3–REV74–TRIP13 complex, given the
additional contacts (labeled site-2) between a second C-REV7–
O-REV7 conformational heterodimer and subunit E of TRIP13 in
this complex (Fig. 4 D and E). Stabilization of O-REV7 in the
context of a single C-REV7–O-REV7 conformational heterodimer
may require the presence of additional factors bound to the complex. In this regard, it should be noted that a recent study established that p31comet promotes homologous recombination by
inactivating REV7 through the TRIP13 AAA+ ATPase (46). A
future structural effort could provide insights into how p31comet
promotes TRIP13 to recognize and remodel Shieldin.
Comparison of C-REV7–O-REV7 Conformational Heterodimer with
C-REV7–C-REV7 Homodimer and C-MAD2–O-MAD2 Conformational
Heterodimer. REV7 and its counterparts have multifaceted roles

as regulation modules in diverse cellular pathways. Previous structural studies have primarily focused on the binding of monomeric
C-REV7 to its partners that contain the consensus REV7-binding
motif, and only recently has attention turned to the functional importance of REV7 dimerization in translesion DNA synthesis (37).
The latest cryo-EM structure of yeast DNA polymerase ζ reveals a
head-to-tail dimer of C-REV7-C-REV7 caused by the two tandem
RBMs of REV3 (36) (SI Appendix, Fig. S12A). By contrast, SHLD3
uses its C-terminal segment to bind C-REV7 and its N-terminal
segment to stabilize the O-REV7 and thus result in a conformationally different C-REV7–O-REV7 dimer (29) (SI Appendix, Fig.
S12B). Interestingly, both C-REV7–C-REV7 in the DNA polymerase ζ complex and C-REV7–O-REV7 dimers in the Shieldin

complex can be remodeled by TRIP13 (28), supporting our findings
that the safety-belt segment of C-REV7 common to both complexes
is sufficient for TRIP13 interaction. As an example, the interaction
between the C-REV7 safety belt and subunit C of TRIP13 hexamer
is shown in Fig. 7A.
Structural alignment of the C-REV7–O-REV7 dimer with
C-MAD2–O-MAD2 dimer (Protein Data Bank [PDB]: 2V64; SI
Appendix, Fig. S12C) (47), the analog of REV7 functioning in
the cell cycle checkpoint, reveals a highly conserved overall architecture (rmsd = 1.487 Å) (SI Appendix, Fig. S12D). However,
the MAD2 homodimer cannot be remodeled by TRIP13. Instead,
MAD2 requires its partner p31comet to form a C-MAD2–p31comet
heterodimer for recruitment to TRIP13. This is very likely due to
the obvious sequence differences between REV7 and MAD2 in
their safety-belt regions (SI Appendix, Fig. S12E). This is supported by the cryo-EM structure of the TRIP13–p31comet–MAD2
complex (referred to as TRIP13–p31-substrate complex) showing
that the safety-belt element of C-MAD2 forms no direct contacts
with TRIP13 (Fig. 7B) (29).
Structural Diversity of C-REV7–O-REV7-Substrate and MAD2–p31-Substrate
Recruitment by TRIP13 Hexamer. The cryo-EM structure of

MAD2–p31-substrate–TRIP13 complex (Fig. 7B) shows a direct interaction between p31comet and a conserved and negatively charged
surface on monomer D (white circle in Fig. 7C), mediating the recruitment of the p31-substrate by TRIP13. By contrast, the corresponding surface in the cryo-EM structure of the C-REV7–O-REV7substrate–TRIP13 complex (Fig. 7A) resides on monomer E rather

than monomer D (site-3; yellow circle in Fig. 7C), thereby providing a
potential binding site for the O-REV7–TRIP13 interaction. These
data indicate that TRIP13 utilizes different interfaces for substrate
recruitment.
Relative Positioning of Inserted REV7NT and MAD2NT into the TRIP13
+
Pore. Most of substrate–pore interactions in AAA ATPase

complexes involve backbone hydrogen bonding and steric contacts
to comply with the sequence-independent translocation mechanism (38). In the structures of C-REV7–O-REV7-substrateTRIP13 and MAD2–p31-substrate-TRIP13 complexes, the
REV7NT and MAD2NT residues insert with different registers into
the TRIP13 pore (residues 8 to 14 for REV7NT and residues 2 to 9
for MAD2NT) (Fig. 7 D and E). It has been shown previously that
the inserted “5-LSR-7” segment of MAD2NT is well defined in the
structure (Fig. 7E) and important for TRIP13 remodeling (29). A
related “4-LTR-6” segment is shared by REV7NT, but such a motif
is not visible in our structure of the C-REV7–O-REV7-substrate–
TRIP13 complex. Instead, we observe the “8-DLNF-12” segment of
REV7NT in the TRIP13 pore (Figs. 4G and 7D). We propose that
MAD2NT is inserting the 5-LSR-7 segment midway into the narrow
pore at the center of TRIP13 in the MAD2–p31-substrate–TRIP13
complex (Fig. 7E), while the 4-LTR-6 segment is captured by the
TRIP13 pore during the initial step of insertion, and subsequently
completely threaded through the pore, leading the following residues 8 to 14 inserting into the pore in the C-REV7–O-REV7substrate–TRIP13 complex (Fig. 7D). Of note, since we used the
noncatalytic TRIP13 mutant and ATPγS in generation of the

Protein Expression and Purification. The codon-optimized DNA sequences
were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT). The REV7 sequence
was cloned into the MCS1 of the pRSFDuet-1 vector (Novagen) engineered
with an N-terminal His6-SUMO tag, and the untagged SHLD3s, SHLD3(residues 1 to 58), SHLD2.3, or SHLD2L.3 related sequence was cloned into the
MCS2, respectively. The REV7 mutant (R124A) was generated using the
QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit. The proteins were expressed in
Escherichia coli strain BL21 CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL (Stratagene). Bacteria were
grown in Luria-Bertani medium at 37 °C to OD600 of 0.8 and induced by
0.3 mM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside at 18 °C overnight. The protein complex was purified by a HisTrap FF column (GE Healthcare) and the

reloaded on a HisTrap FF column in the buffer (20 mM Tris·HCl, pH 8.0,

loaded on an anion exchange column (HiTrap Q HP, GE Healthcare). The

“basal state 0” of the REV7-substrate–TRIP13 complex. To explore how ATP-driven translocation of TRIP13 induces Shieldin
remodeling, we modeled the “basal state 1” following the first
cycle of catalysis (shown schematically in Fig. 8 A and B and model
in Fig. 8 C and D). Together with insights from previous reports
(29, 38), we propose a model to explain Shieldin remodeling
mediated by TRIP13 (Fig. 8 A–D, Movie S1). In state 0, pore
loops 1 and 2 of monomers A0, B0, and C0 hold the C-REV7NT
within the central pore (Fig. 8A), while the poly-E loop of
monomer B0 contacts the safety-belt segment of C-REV7
(Fig. 8A; site-1 shown in Fig. 4E), while monomer E0 contacts loop
88 to 95 of O-REV7 (site-3 shown in Fig. 4E), with all these interactions contributing to the stabilization of the complex. The
first cycle of ATP hydrolysis occurs in monomer E0, which transforms from a compact ATP-bound state to a flexible apo-state
labeled E1, thereby releasing O-REV7 (Movie S1); meanwhile,
the neighboring seam monomer F0 binds one ATP molecule to
adopt an ATP-bound F1 state (Fig. 8 C and D). The resulting
structural changes cause F1 to climb to the top of the AAA+ spiral
to force an anticlockwise rotation of the REV7 substrate relative
to TRIP13. In state 1, the pore loops 1 and 2 of monomers F1, A1,
and B1 hold the C-REV7NT (Fig. 8B), poly-E loop of monomer A1
contacts the safety-belt segment of C-REV7 (Fig. 8B), while
monomer D1 contacts loop 88 to 95 of O-REV7 (Fig. 8D). The
continued stepwise rotations of SHLD2.3–REV7 can eventually
cause steric clashes between the REV7 substrate and TRIP13,

the proposed remodeling mechanism of TRIP13-mediated SHLD2.3–REV7

the translocation of TRIP13 monomers draws the thread from REV7 into the
channel in stepwise manner. (C and D) Models of the SHLD2.3–REV74–TRIP13

TRIP13 monomers A0, B0, and C0 hold the C-REV7NT, while monomer E0
contacts O-REV7. As shown in D, the first cycle of ATP hydrolysis occurs in
monomer E0, which transforms from a compact ATP-bound state to the
flexible apo-state E1; the neighboring seam monomer F0 binds one ATP
molecule to adopt the ATP-bound F1 state. These structural changes cause F1
to climb to the top of the AAA+ spiral to push an anticlockwise rotation of
the SHLD2.3–REV7 dimer, which renders O-REV7 to form new contacts with
monomer D1.

Crystallization and Structure Determination. The SHLD3s–REV7 complex was
crystallized by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method to equilibrate 1.5 μL of
SHLD3s–REV7 solution (about 10 mg/mL) with 1.5 μL of reservoir solution (0.2 M
ammonium acetate, 0.1 M Na citrate pH 5.6, 30% PEG4000) at 20 °C. The
SHLD2.3–REV74 complex was crystallized by the hanging drop vapor diffusion
method to equilibrate 1.5 μL of SHLD2.3–REV7 solution (about 4 mg/mL) with
1.5 μL of reservoir solution (0.1 M Na acetate pH 5.6, 1.5 M Na formate) at 20 °C.
The crystals were harvested into cryoprotectant solution containing 30% glycerol before being flash frozen by liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data were
collected on the 24-ID-C and 24-ID-E beamline at the Advanced Photon Source.
The data were autoprocessed by the Northeastern Collaborative Access Team
Rapid Automated Processing of Data (RAPD) online server.
Both structures were determined by molecular replacement in PHENIX.Phaser (48, 49) using the modified REV7–REV3 complex structure (PDB code

Expression and Purification of TRIP13 Complexes. The codon-optimized TRIP13
DNA sequence was synthesized by IDT and cloned into the pRSFDuet-1 vector
(Novagen) engineered with an N-terminal His6-SUMO tag. The TRIP13 mutant
(E253Q) was generated using QuikChange. The wild-type and mutant proteins
were expressed in E. coli strain BL21 CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL (Stratagene). As previously reported (29, 30), the TRIP13 hexamer was purified by anion exchange
(HiTrap Q HP) and size exclusion (Superdex 200 [16/60]) chromatography in the
buffer (20 mM Hepes pH 7.3, 100 mM NaCl, and 1 mM DTT). The high-purity
eluting fractions were detected by SDS-PAGE and concentrated to around
5 mg/mL.
Reconstitution of SHLD2.3–REV74–TRIP13(E253Q) and SHLD2L.3–REV72–TRIP13(E253Q)
Complexes for EM Analysis. The purified SHLD2.3–REV74 proteins were incubated
with purified TRIP13(E253Q) at 2:1 molar ratio (accounting for SHLD2.3–REV74 and
TRIP13 hexamer) in an assembly reaction buffer (20 mM Hepes pH 7.3, 100 mM
NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM ATPγS, and 1 mM DTT) for 1 h at 23 °C. The assembly
reaction was then purified by size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 200 [16/
60]) with a running buffer containing 20 mM Hepes pH 7.3, 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM
MgCl2, 0.1 mM ATPγS, and 1 mM DTT. The complex eluted in a peak fraction at a
concentration of 0.3 mg/mL and was used to prepare cryo-EM grids. The same
protocol was applied to reconstitute the SHLD2L.3–REV72–TRIP13(E253Q) complex.
Cryo-EM Data Collection. A total of 3.0 μL of 0.3 mg/mL complex samples was
applied onto glow-discharged UltrAuFoil 300 mesh R1.2/1.3 grids (Quantifoil). Grids were blotted for 1.5 s at around 100% humidity and 4 °C and
plunge frozen in liquid ethane using an FEI Vitrobot Mark IV. Images were
collected on a FEI Titan Krios electron microscope operating at 300 kV with a
Gatan K3 camera. All data were collected using a set defocus range of −1.0
μm to −2.5 μm with a pixel size of 1.064 Å at the Richard Rifkind Center for
Cryo-EM at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Movies were recorded
in superresolution mode at an electron dose rate of 20 e−/pixel/s with a total
exposure time of 3 s, for an accumulated electron dose of 53 e−/Å2. Intermediate frames were recorded every 0.075 s for a total number of 40 frames.
Cryo-EM Image Processing. Drift correction of the movie frames was performed
with MotionCor2 (52). Contrast transfer function parameters were estimated
by CTFFIND4 (53). All other steps of image processing were carried out with
RELION3 (54). All reported map resolutions are from gold-standard refinement
procedures with the Fourier shell correlation (FSC) = 0.143 criterion after
postprocessing by applying a soft mask. For data from the SHLD2.3–REV74–
TRIP13(E253Q) complex, automated particle selection resulted in 1,212,927
particles from 1,363 images. After two rounds of two-dimensional (2D) classification, a total of 846,918 particles were selected for 3D classification using
the TRIP13–p31-substrate model (PDB 6F0X) as reference. Particles corresponding to the best class with the highest-resolution features were selected
and subjected to the second round of 3D classification. One of 3D classes
showed extra density of SHLD2.3–REV74, and the corresponding 104,023
particles were polished using RELION particle polishing, yielding a consensus
electron microscopy map with a resolution of 3.6 Å after 3D autorefinement.
The masked local refinement by applying a soft mask around the SHLD2.3–
REV74 density provides a focused electron microscopy map with a resolution of
3.8 Å. Local resolution estimations were calculated from two half data maps

with RELION3. Further details related to data processing and refinement are
summarized in SI Appendix, Table S2.
As for data from the SHLD2L.3–REV72–TRIP13(E253Q) complex, automated particle selection resulted in 1,030,830 particles from 2,438 images.
After two rounds of 2D classification, a total of 925,535 particles were selected for 3D classification using the TRIP13–p31-substrate model (PDB 6F0X)
as reference. A total of 414,774 particles corresponding to the best two
classes with the highest-resolution features were selected and subjected to
the second round of 3D classification with applying a soft mask around the
SHLD2L.3–REV72 density. Three of the 3D classes showed extra density of
SHLD2L.3–REV72 and the corresponding 69,882, 61,657, and 43,949 particles
were selected, yielding three consensus electron microscopy maps with
resolutions of 3.9, 3.9, and 4.1 Å after 3D autorefinement. Local resolution
estimations were calculated from two half data maps with RELION3 (54).
Atomic Model Building and Refinement of Cryo-EM Data. The consensus and
focused maps of the SHLD2.3–REV74–TRIP13(E253Q) complex were aligned and
combined with the PHENIX.CombineFoucsedMaps (48) to construct a composite map to 3.6 Å, the resolution of the consensus map, and refinement was
carried out at this resolution. To build the model, the crystal structure of the
SHLD2.3–REV74 complex (this work) and cryo-EM structure of TRIP13(E253Q)
(PDB 6F0X) were docked into the composite map using UCSF Chimera and
then manually rebuilt in COOT as needed. All models were refined against the
composite maps using Phenix.real_space_refine (55) by applying geometric
and secondary structure restraints. All figures were prepared by PyMol (https://
pymol.org/2/) or UCSF Chimera (56). The statistics for data collection and model
refinement are shown in SI Appendix, Table S2.
SEC-MALS Experiments. For protein molar mass determination, purified
SHLD3s–REV7, SHLD3 (1 to 58)–REV7, and SHLD2.3–REV7 proteins were analyzed using an ÄKTA-MALS system. A mini DAWN TREOS multiangle light
scattering detector (Wyatt Technology) and an Optilab T-rEX refractometer
(Wyatt Technology) were used in-line with a Superdex200 10/300 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) preequilibrated in the buffer (20 mM Tris·HCl
[pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCl, and 2 mM DTT) at a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min. Separation and ultraviolet (UV) detection were performed by ÄKTA Pure System
(GE Healthcare), light scattering was monitored by the mini DAWN TREOS
system, and concentration was measured by the Optilab TrEX differential
refractometer. Molar masses of proteins were calculated using the Astra 6.1
program (Wyatt Technology) with a dn/dc value (refractive index increment)
of 0.185 mL/g. The data were plotted using Prime8 software (GraphPad).
ATP Activity Assay of TRIP13 in the Presence of SHLD2L.3–REV7 Substrate. The
SHLD2L.3–REV7 dimer constructions containing REV7 mutations as well as
TRIP13 with the E113A/E114A/E115A mutation (refers to polyE/A) were
generated using QuikChange and confirmed by sequencing. The expression
and purification of these mutants are the same as those for the wild-type
proteins. A total of 2 μM of wild-type or mutated TRIP13 was incubated with
10 μM SHLD2L.3–REV7 substrates at 37 °C in 100 μL reaction buffer (20 mM
Hepes pH 7.3, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM ATP, and 1 mM DTT). As
for indicated time points, 10 μL of reaction solution was taken out and
added into a 384-well flat bottom white polystyrene microplate (Greiner
Bio-One), and then mixed with 10 μL Kinase-Glo reagent (Promega) for
10 min at room temperature. The luminescence signals were measured using
a TECAN Infinite M1000 reader with default mode (1,000 ms, no reduction).
The data were analyzed with Prism 8 software (GraphPad).
