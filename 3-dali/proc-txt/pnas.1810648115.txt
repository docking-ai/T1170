The protein disaggregase ClpB hexamer is conserved across
evolution and has two AAA+-type nucleotide-binding domains,
NBD1 and NBD2, in each protomer. In M. tuberculosis (Mtb), ClpB
facilitates asymmetric distribution of protein aggregates during
cell division to help the pathogen survive and persist within the
host, but a mechanistic understanding has been lacking. Here we
report cryo-EM structures at 3.8- to 3.9-Å resolution of Mtb ClpB
bound to a model substrate, casein, in the presence of the weakly
hydrolyzable ATP mimic adenosine 5′-[γ-thio]triphosphate. Mtb
ClpB existed in solution in two closed-ring conformations, conformers 1 and 2. In both conformers, the 12 pore-loops on the
12 NTDs of the six protomers (P1–P6) were arranged similarly to
a staircase around the bound peptide. Conformer 1 is a lowaffinity state in which three of the 12 pore-loops (the protomer
P1 NBD1 and NBD2 loops and the protomer P2 NBD1 loop) are not
engaged with peptide. Conformer 2 is a high-affinity state because
only one pore-loop (the protomer P2 NBD1 loop) is not engaged
with the peptide. The resolution of the two conformations, along
with their bound substrate peptides and nucleotides, enabled us
to propose a nucleotide-driven peptide translocation mechanism
of a bacterial ClpB that is largely consistent with several recent
unfoldase structures, in particular with the eukaryotic Hsp104.
However, whereas Hsp104’s two NBDs move in opposing directions during one step of peptide translocation, in Mtb ClpB the
two NBDs move only in the direction of translocation.
Mycobacterium tuberculosis
cryo-EM

in the cryo-EM study of a ClpB variant of Escherichia coli ClpB
with two Walker B mutations, E279A and E678A (called
“BAP”), only a single closed conformation with a seam in the
NBD1 ring was derived for the asymmetric double-ring structure
bound to casein (7). It is currently uncertain if an open state
exists in a bacterial disaggregase and whether there is any
mechanistic distinction between a bacterial ClpB and eukaryotic
Hsp104.
ClpB is important for the survival and persistence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) in the host and has been proposed
as a novel target for the development of antituberculosis (antiTB) drugs (17). ClpB facilitates asymmetrical distribution of
protein aggregates within Mtb and between a given Mtb cell’s two
progeny as part of its defense of the pathogen against host immunity and chemotherapy (18). In an in vitro system to reconstitute refolding of a model protein aggregate, the full
function of Mtb ClpB required several partners, including DnaK,
DnaJ1, DnaJ2, GrpE, and Hsp20 (4). Structural studies of Mtb
ClpB are important not only to gain a mechanistic understanding
but also for the future development of small molecules targeting
Significance
The Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) ClpB is a ring-shaped,
ATP-driven disaggregase. The ability to rescue aggregated
proteins is crucial for Mtb to grow and persist in the host.
Despite extensive studies in the past two decades, it is still not
well understood how a bacterial disaggregase couples ATP
binding and hydrolysis to peptide translocation. Our cryo-EM
study of the Mtb ClpB in the presence of a peptide substrate
and the slowly hydrolysable adenosine 5′-[γ-thio]triphosphate
revealed two active conformations in the midst of the substratethreading process. This, together with the resolved nucleotide
state in each of the 12 nucleotide-binding domains of the ClpB
hexamer, helps define a detailed atomic trajectory that
couples ATP binding and hydrolysis to mechanical protein
translocation.

acterial ClpB and eukaryotic Hsp104 belong to the Hsp100
family of chaperones (1). They cooperate with DnaK/Hsp70
cochaperones and additional accessory proteins to refold and
rescue damaged proteins from their aggregated states, thereby
helping cells survive under stress conditions (2–4). ClpB/Hsp104
utilize energy from ATP hydrolysis to thread polypeptides
through their central pore and therefore are called “protein
disaggregases” (1, 5). Structural studies have revealed a hexameric ring architecture with each protomer having three main
domains: an N-terminal domain (NTD) for substrate binding and
two tandem AAA+-type nucleotide-binding domains, NBD1 and
NBD2, responsible for ATP-driven peptide translocation (6–11).
ClpB/Hsp104 has a coiled-coil middle domain (MD) inserted in
the NBD1 that distinguishes it from other AAA+ ATPases and
regulates the disaggregation activity (6–8, 10, 12, 13). Despite
their similar activity, there may be functional distinctions between the two homologs. For example, Hsp104, but not ClpB,
has the ability to sever amyloid (14). The individual protomers of
the Hsp104 hexamer were found to collaborate in a noncooperative manner, whereas those of ClpB function cooperatively (15). Structurally, Hsp104 has an extra C-terminal
extension important for its oligomerization, but ClpB lacks
such an extension (16). Recently, an elegant cryo-EM study
revealed that yeast Hsp104 bound to casein had a closed and an
open conformation, and on the basis of these states a ratchet-like
substrate translocation mechanism was proposed (6). However,

this essential proteostasis system to treat TB, the leading cause
of death due to an infectious disease worldwide. Using cryo-EM,
we have captured Mtb ClpB in the midst of threading a peptide
in two distinct but largely closed conformations at a resolution of
3.8–3.9 Å. These structures have enabled us to propose a coordinated, sequential ATP hydrolysis-coupled peptide translocation mechanism for this bacterial disaggregase.
Results
Mtb ClpB Is a Left-Handed Open Spiral in Either ADP-Bound or
Adenylyl-Imidodiphosphate-Bound States but Switches to a RightHanded Spiral in the Presence of Adenosine 5′-[γ-thio]triphosphate.

Mtb ClpB Switches to a Closed State When Bound to Casein. As noted
above, Mtb ClpB in the presence of ATPγS existed in both open
and closed states. We found that Mtb ClpB existed primarily in
the closed state when bound to casein, which mimicked a disordered protein substrate, and in the presence of ATPγS (Fig.
1A). This observation implies that the open state is converted to
the closed state upon ClpB engagement with a protein substrate.
We derived a cryo-EM 3D density map of Mtb ClpB-caseinATPγS to an average resolution of 3.6 Å (SI Appendix, Fig. S2).
We noticed that P1 had weak densities, indicative of significant
conformational dynamics in this region. Another round of 3D
classification led to the identification of two conformations of
the closed state, one at 3.8-Å resolution termed “conformer 1”
and the other at 3.9-Å resolution termed “conformer 2” (Fig. 1 C
and D and SI Appendix, Fig. S2). In both conformers, the NTDs
were invisible, likely due to high flexibility, but the NBD1 and

Full-length Mtb ClpB was expressed in E. coli and purified as a
hexamer, as reported (4). We examined by cryo-EM the overall
architecture of the hexamer in the absence of a peptide substrate
but in the presence of different nucleotides by incubating the
protein in 2 mM ADP, the nonhydrolysable ATP analog adenylyl-imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP), or the weakly hydrolysable
ATP analog adenosine 5′-[γ-thio]triphosphate (ATPγS). Referencefree 2D image classification revealed that in the presence of
either ADP or AMP-PNP, ClpB adopted an open and asymmetric ring (Fig. 1A). 3D reconstruction of the AMP-PNP form
allowed us to derive a 6.3-Å resolution map of six ClpB protomers arranged in a left-handed spiral architecture with NBD1 of
the bottom end protomer (protomer 1; P1) and NBD2 of the top
end protomer (protomer 2; P2) contacting each other (Fig. 1B
and SI Appendix, Fig. S1). This left-handed Mtb ClpB open spiral
resembled that of yeast Hsp104 bound to either ADP or AMPPNP (6, 11). It is unlikely that a fully ADP- or ATP-bound state
(as mimicked in vitro here by AMP-PNP) could exist under

physiological conditions. Nevertheless, such an open state may
represent a nonprocessive configuration ready for initial peptide
engagement or poised to let go of unfolded peptide (6, 11). In
the presence of ATPγS, Mtb ClpB took on two conformations.
One represented the open state described above. The other,
termed the “closed state,” was more symmetric, with the central
chamber of the hexameric ring almost sealed off (Fig. 1A).
Interconversion between the open and closed states required a
large conformational rearrangement, which might be facilitated by the hydrolysis of ATPγS in some of the six ClpB
protomers. These nucleotide-induced conformational changes
were consistent with previous studies of E. coli ClpB and yeast
Hsp104 (6, 7).

NBD2 of each protomer were visualized in sufficient structural
detail for atomic modeling (Fig. 2). In the atomic model of each
conformer, the six NBD1s and six NBD2s of the ClpB hexamer
assembled into two stacked right-handed spirals. However, the
ClpB hexamer maintained an overall closed architecture in both
conformers because protomer P1 at the beginning of the spiral
was topologically connected with protomer P2 at the end of the
spiral (Figs. 1 C and D and 2A). Although the overall architecture of Mtb ClpB was similar to that of Hsp104 (6), key differences existed between these two disaggregases. Both Hsp104 and
ClpB were in a state where they had casein and ATPγS bound.
Hsp104 was found to have a closed state and an open state, and
in the open state both NBD1 and NBD2 rings were fully open
and topologically discontinuous (6). In Mtb ClpB, however, the
two observed conformers were both in the closed state, and the
major changes from conformer 1 to conformer 2 occurred when
NBD1 of protomer P1 rotated and moved upward to make
contact with NBD1 of neighboring P6 and moved inward to bind
casein, while the entire NBD2 ring was largely unchanged (Fig. 1
C and D). These differences may underlie a subtle mechanistic
distinction between ClpB and Hsp104, discussed below.

hydroxyl of the same residue (Fig. 3D). Inside the NBD2 ring,
the Y658 phenyl ring in pore-loop 2 formed a hydrophobic interaction with V656 (Fig. 3E). These residues are well conserved.
Their individual substitution by alanine nearly abolished ClpBmediated substrate unfolding activity in vitro (Fig. 3F).
Protomers P3, P4, P5, and P6 all engaged the substrate in a
similar manner in both conformers 1 and 2, with their respective
pore-loops 1 and 2 all interacting with the substrate peptide.
Therefore, the key differences between the two conformers resided in protomers P1 and P2 (Fig. 3 A and B). In conformer 1,
pore-loops 1 and 2 of protomer P1 and pore-loop 1 of protomer
P2 were disordered and had little contact with the casein peptide
(Fig. 3 A and G). In conformer 2, however, pore-loops 1 and 2 of
protomer P1 were ordered, and both were in close contact with
the substrate (Fig. 3 B and G). Because more pore-loops in
conformer 2 than in conformer 1 are engaged with the peptide,
we refer to conformer 2 as the “high-affinity state” and conformer 1 as the “low-affinity state.” The difference in substrate
affinity was a result of conformational changes driven by nucleotide hydrolysis, as described next.

Mtb ClpB conformers, the axial substrate-translocation channels
were lined with 12 pore-loops: six pore-loops 1 of the six NBD1s
(hereafter “pore-loops 1”) and six pore-loops 2 of the six NBD2s
(hereafter “pore-loops 2”) (Figs. 2B and 3 A–C). More specifically, the six Y251 residues of the six pore-loops 1 and six
Y655 residues and six V656 residues of the six pore-loops 2 were
arranged in a right-handed staircase with a step size of two amino
acids, ∼6.6 Å in height. These bulky and hydrophobic residues
stacked against the peptide backbone of the bound casein (Fig.
3C). This general mode of substrate engagement was maintained
by several intersubunit interactions. Inside the NBD1 ring, the
side chain of R252 of one protomer was oriented toward poreloop 1 of a neighboring protomer to form an H-bond with the
carbonyl oxygen of S249 and another H-bond with the side-chain

vided into a distal motif 1 and a proximal motif 2, and the MD
motif 1 of one protomer can latch onto the NBD1 of a neighboring protomer, forming an interprotomer brace (6, 7, 10). In
the cryo-EM maps of Mtb ClpB, only the MD motifs 1 of protomers P4–P6 were resolved, including some large amino acid
side chains. These densities enabled us to rigid-body fit the
crystal structure of the E. coli ClpB MD domains to build an
atomic model for the three MD motifs 1 (Fig. 4 A and B and SI
Appendix, Fig. S3A). Therefore, the entire MD domains of
protomers P1–P3 and the MD motifs 2 of protomers P4–P6 were
dynamic. The flexibility of all six MD motifs 2 in Mtb ClpB was
notable and in our structure might be due to the absence of a
binding partner, such as one of the DnaK cochaperones (19).
The three resolved MD motifs 1 of protomers P4–P6 were of a

Fig. 3. Interactions between ClpB and bound substrate mimic casein. (A and B) Individual protomers within conformer 1 (Conf 1) (A) and conformer 2 (Conf 2) (B)
are shown separately with a 60° rotation around the bound casein, superposed with their corresponding cryo-EM densities. The casein peptide was aligned across
panels (horizontal solid lines) to show the relative height of each protomer in the hexamer. The two slanted lines in each panel connect the pore-loops 1 and
2 across individual protomers, respectively. The dashed lines connect to disordered loops. In both conformations, protomers P3–P6 were fully engaged with the
casein through their respective pore-loops 1 and 2, and the tyrosine sidechains of all eight pore-loops had good densities (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, protomer
P2 contacted casein via pore-loop 2, but its pore-loop 1 was disordered, so P2 was partially engaged with the peptide. Both pore-loops of P1 were disordered or
unengaged in conformer 1 but become fully engaged in conformer 2. (C) In conformer 1, the pore-loops inside the central chamber surrounded and bound the
substrate casein in a right-handed spiral mode. This spiral was discontinued at pore-loops 1 of protomers P1 and P2 in the NBD1 ring and at pore-loop 2 of
protomer P1 in the NBD2 ring; these pore-loops were flexible and did not contact the substrate. (D) Interactions among neighboring pore-loops 1 and the
substrate. Y251 stacked with the casein main chain while R252 H-bonded with S249 of neighboring pore-loops to stabilize the right-handed spiral arrangement.
(E) Interactions among neighboring pore-loops 2 and the substrate. Y655 and V656 stacked with the peptide while V656 stacked with Y658 of neighboring loops
to stabilize their spiral arrangement. (F) Mutational analysis of the key residues in the pore-loops using a luciferase-based model protein aggregate reactivation
assay. The Walker B mutations E279A and E680A were used as negative controls. Data were normalized to reactions containing wild-type ClpB, Hsp20, and DnaK
along with cofactors DnaJ1, DnaJ2, and GrpE, which together reactivate denatured luciferase. The dashed line at 60% of wild-type activity defines the yield of
reactions lacking ClpB (white bars), indicating the background refolding activity of DnaK and cofactors alone. Hence, reactions with ClpB mutants (blue bars) that
show about 60% activity are defined as nonfunctional. (G) A comparison of pore-loops in conformer 1 (magenta) and conformer 2 (colored by protomers as in C).
The two conformations were aligned by their respective caseins. Dashed curves mark disordered loops.

P5 in regions marked by the solid-outlined and dashed-outlined boxes in A, Lower, respectively. The NBD1–NBD1 and NBD2–NBD2 interfaces were similar;
both involved the ATP-binding pocket (shaded in gray) that interacted with the arginine finger from a neighboring protomer and a helix of the small helical
domain that interacted with a loop from a neighboring protomer, either by salt bridges in NBD1 (R196 vs. D393/D396/E397) or by hydrophobic packing in
NBD2 (V593 vs. L772/L776/L819/L823).

similar configuration in both conformers 1 and 2, stabilized by
three salt bridges with their respective neighboring NBD1s:
D414 to R188, R418 to D184, and E426 to R352 (Fig. 4B). The
bracing interaction of these MD motifs 1 might be important for
conformational coupling between the protomers in the ClpB
hexamer, because we found that individually breaking up these
salt bridges by reversing the charges nearly abolished the
peptide-unfolding activity of Mtb ClpB in vitro (Fig. 4C). Although not observed here in Mtb ClpB, it is known that the MD
motif 1 can assume an alternative configuration by protruding
outwards and dissociating from the neighboring NBD1 (6–8).
The unbracing motion of MD motif 1 required a rotation around
a highly conserved hydrophobic region comprised of P410, I413,
and W463 (Fig. 4B and SI Appendix, Fig. S3 B and C). This region was previously unappreciated but is essential for ClpB activity, because replacement of P410 with an alanine rendered
Mtb ClpB virtually nonfunctional (Fig. 4C). Hence, the interconversion of MD motif 1 between the bracing and unbracing
configurations is important.
Interprotomer Contacts in NDB1 and NBD2 Rings. Protomers P1 and
P2 in conformer 1 were of weaker densities, packed loosely in the
ClpB hexamer, and therefore are termed “mobile protomers,”
compared with the “tight protomers” P3–P6 with very strong
densities (Fig. 4A). The four tight protomers were arranged in a
continuous right-handed spiral (Figs. 1 C and D and 2A) and
E9564 | www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1810648115

were essentially in the same conformation (SI Appendix, Fig. S4)
with extensive interprotomer interactions between their respective NBD1 domains as well as between NBD2 domains (Fig.
4D). Each of the four tight protomers bound two well-resolved
ATPγS (SI Appendix, Fig. S5), one in NBD1 and one in NBD2,
with their respective nucleotide phosphates binding to the P-loop
of a Walker-A motif typical of AAA+ ATPases (Fig. 2B) (20).
The conserved arginine fingers of the adjacent protomer,
R332 and R333 in NBD1 and R746 in NBD2, interacted with
γ-phosphate of the bound ATPγS. In NBD2, R805 in the helical
subdomain provided additional contact with the γ-phosphate
(Fig. 4D). Additional notable interprotomer contacts included
(i) salt-bridges in the NBD1 ring formed between D393, D396,
and E397 of one protomer and R196 and K199 of the neighboring protomer; this contact was further strengthened by an
interprotomer hydrophobic interaction between V191 and M404;
and (ii) hydrophobic stacking of L772, L776, L819, and L823 of
one protomer with V593 of the adjacent protomer in the
NBD2 ring, which was further strengthened by two salt-bridges,
one between R775 and D595 and the other between D817 and
R588. These interprotomer interactions in ClpB NBD1 and
NBD2 were topologically similar, involving the same α-helices
of the small helical domain and the same loop preceding the
Walker A motif of the adjacent protomer (Fig. 4D). Similar
interprotomer interactions are also seen in other AAA+
unfoldases, such as Hsp104, Vps4, and Yme1 (SI Appendix,

Nucleotide Hydrolysis-Dependent Conformational Changes from
Conformers 1 and 2. In conformer 1 of Mtb ClpB, the tight pro-

tomers P3–P6 formed a strictly right-handed open spiral, which
was bridged by the two mobile protomers, P1 and P2 (Fig. 2A).
The relative positions of NBD1 and NBD2 of the mobile protomers were different from those of the tight protomers (SI
Appendix, Fig. S4A), leading to the weak interactions between
the mobile protomers (Fig. 5A). Importantly, protomers P1 and
P2 were not in the expected uniform ATPγS-bound state. Instead, NBD1 of protomer P1 and NBD2 of protomer P2 had
little to very low density for nucleotides and therefore were
tentatively assigned as apo/ADP-like states. However, NBD2 of
protomer P1 and NBD1 of protomer P2 remained in the ATPlike state with well-defined ATPγS density (Fig. 5C). Consistent
with the disrupted interactions between the nucleotide and arginine fingers, the two apo/ADP sites had the smallest interprotomer contact areas (Fig. 5A). In conformer 2 of Mtb ClpB
both NBD1 and NBD2 of protomer P2 were in the apo/ADP-like
state, while the other 10 nucleotide pockets were occupied by
ATPγS (Fig. 5C). The ring architecture remained nearly intact,
and structural changes compared with conformer 1 were limited
to protomers P1 and P2, with NBD1 of protomer P1 rotating up
∼20° toward the casein, generating a small seam with the protomer P2 NBD1, and the two NBD2s of protomers P1 and
P2 together rotating ∼4° upwards (Fig. 5 A, B, and D). Both
NBD1 and NBD2 rotations were around their respective pivot
points described above (Fig. 4D). These changes in Mtb ClpB
were very different from those in yeast Hsp104, in which the
protomer equivalent to ClpB protomer P1 was found to move
upwards, and the adjacent protomer corresponding to ClpB
P2 moved downward, leading to a gap in the hexamer ring (Fig.
5E) (6). The changes in ClpB converted protomer P1 into the
same configuration as protomers P3–P6 (SI Appendix, Fig. S4B).
As a result, protomers P6 and P1 then formed a tight interface,
with pore-loops 1 and 2 of protomer P1 moving up by 15 Å and
7 Å, respectively, to make contacts with the casein (Fig. 5D, Inset).
Therefore, conformer 2 was a higher affinity state for the substrate than conformer 1. From conformer 1 to conformer 2, only
the two NBD1 domains of protomers P1 and P2 switched their
nucleotide states: NBD1 of protomer P1 switched from an
apo/ADP-like to an ATP-like state, and NBD1 of protomer
P2 switched from an ATP-like state to an apo/ADP-like state.
Therefore, ATP hydrolysis by protomer P2 NBD1 reduced the
interprotomer contact interface between protomers P1 and
P2 from 1,652 Å2 to 935 Å2, while switching from an Apo/ADPlike to an ATP-like state at protomer P1 NBD1 strengthened the
interprotomer interaction between protomers P6 and P1 from
1,236 Å2 to 2,931 Å2. These nucleotide-binding/hydrolysis events
drove protomer P1 NBD1 away from protomer P2 NBD1 and
toward protomer P6 NBD1, leading to the tight interface between protomers P1 and P6 in conformer 2 (Fig. 5D).
A Potential ATP-Binding and Hydrolysis-Coupled Peptide Translocation
Mechanism of Mtb ClpB. The two conformers of Mtb ClpB bound

to casein as described above likely represent two distinct steps
during the process of protein substrate disaggregation. Because of
the relatively good resolution, we were able to assign the nucleotide
state of each of the 12 NBDs in both conformers. By alternating the
two conformers, we propose the following atomic model for an
ATP-binding and hydrolysis-coupled three-stage peptide translocation mechanism (Fig. 6 and Movie S1). In the first stage, the
Mtb ClpB hexamer in conformer 1 is in a low-affinity state, because
three of the 12 pore-loops (i.e., both pore-loops of protomer P1 and
pore-loop 1 of protomer P2) do not contact casein (Fig. 6). In the
Yu et al.

second stage, ATP binding to NBD1 of protomer P1 and ATP
hydrolysis by NBD1 of protomer P2 convert the ClpB hexamer to
conformer 2, in which both pore-loops of protomer P1 now bind to
casein by moving upward by two amino acids on the substrate
peptide, equivalent to a step size of ∼6.6 Å (Fig. 6B). ClpB had high
affinity for substrate in conformer 2, because pore-loop 1 of protomer P2 was the only one of the 12 pore-loops that did not bind
casein (Fig. 6A). The transition from conformer 1 to conformer
2 created two apo/ADP sites in protomer P2 and a small seam
between protomers P1 and P2 (Fig. 5 A–D). In the third stage,
ATP binding to NBD2 of protomer P2 and ATP hydrolysis by
NBD2 of protomer P3 propagate, in a counterclockwise direction,
the substrate-binding pattern of protomers P1 and P2 in stage 1 to
protomers P2 and P3, in which the two protomer P2 pore-loops
move upward to contact the substrate and the protomer P3 poreloop 1 releases casein, thereby driving ClpB back to the low-affinity
state (Fig. 6). Continued propagation of the low- and high-affinity
states across the hexameric ring would generate a unidirectional
force by the shifting pore-loops, powered by ATP binding and
hydrolysis in individual protomers, to provide the power stroke
that threads the substrate through the hexameric chamber.
Discussion
Previous structural studies have revealed common features
among several peptide-translocating AAA+ machines, including
the asymmetric hexameric architecture and the sequential mode
for substrate threading (6, 7, 21–23). The structure of human
p97 was determined to a high resolution of 2.3–3.3 Å in multiple
conformations, but the structure was symmetric, likely due to the
absence of a protein substrate (24). The structure of VAT, an
archaeal homolog of eukaryotic p97, bound to a peptide, was
determined to 4.8-Å resolution and in a single conformation
(23). Single conformations were also determined for the yeast
unfoldase Vps4 bound to an ESCRT-III peptide substrate at
3.2-Å resolution (22), the mitochondrial protease ATPase
YME1 bound to a peptide at 3.4-Å resolution (21), and E. coli
ClpB bound to casein at 4.6-Å resolution (7). The structure of
yeast Hsp104 was determined in two conformations in complex
with casein at a resolution of 4.0–4.1 Å, just shy of resolving the
nucleotides, so that all sites were assigned as ATPγS (6). In the
current study, the Mtb ClpB was determined in two conformations at a slightly improved resolution of 3.8–3.9 Å, enabling
assignment of the nucleotide states of all 12 NBDs. This has led
us to propose a rotary sequential mechanism for Mtb ClpB that is
largely consistent with the previously studied unfoldases and
especially with the evolutionarily conserved Hsp104 (6).
However, we also noted a significant difference between Mtb
ClpB and Hsp104 in the direction of movement of the NBD
domains. In the Mtb ClpB structures, NBD1 and NBD2 always
move in one direction: upwards. However, in Hsp104 NBD1 was
found to move upwards, whereas NBD2 moves downward (6).
The bidirectional movement leads to the formation of a transient
gap stage in the Hsp104 hexamer ring that is not observed in Mtb
ClpB. Further studies are needed to investigate if the observed
structural differences are related to their different substrate
preferences (14) and to their potentially different ATPase activities, i.e., the reported cooperative ATP hydrolysis of ClpB vs.
the probabilistic ATP hydrolysis of Hsp104 (15). Finally, because
Mtb is a major pathogen, our detailed structure and a mechanistic understanding could help in antimycobacterial drug design.
Materials and Methods
Overexpression and Purification of MtbClpB. The construct of Mtb ClpB with
an N-terminal His-SUMO tag was from a previous study (4). A similar sample
preparation procedure was used with some modifications. Briefly, E. coli
Rosetta2 cells (Novagen) transformed with the N-terminal His-SUMO–tagged
Mtb ClpB were cultured in LB medium supplemented with 100 μg/mL
ampicillin and 34 μg/mL chloramphenicol at 37°C and were grown to

Fig. 6. A putative three-stage, rotary sequential nucleotide-driven substrate translocation mechanism of Mtb ClpB. (A) A sketch of the proposed mechanism in
which the hexamer progresses from stage 1 (conformer 1) to stage 2 (conformer 2) and finally to stage 3. Stage progression is driven by ATP binding and hydrolysis
in NBD1 and NBD2 of the two mobile protomers. (B) Atomic trajectories of the progressive conformational changes between stage 1 and 2 and between stage 2 and
3 as illustrated in A. To generate the model for stage 3, conformer 1 was superposed with conformer 2 by aligning protomer P5 in conformer 1 onto protomer P6 in
conformer 2. (C) Unidirectional and progressive rearrangements of the 12 pore-loops as the ClpB hexamer goes through the three stages. From stage 1 (Left) to
stage 2 (Middle), protomer P1 transits from the unengaged state with none of pore-loops 1 and 2 contacting casein to the fully engaged state with both pore-loops
1 and 2 contacting casein. This is caused by the ATP rebinding to NBD1 of protomer P1 and ATP hydrolysis by NBD1 of protomer P2. From stage 2 (Middle) to stage 3
(Right), protomer P2 transits from a partially engaged state with only pore-loop 2 contacting casein to an unengaged state with neither pore-loop 1 nor 2 contacting
casein, and protomer P3 transits from a fully engaged state to a partially engaged state. This step may be caused by ATP rebinding to NBD2 of P2 and ATP hydrolysis
by NBD2 of P3. The net effect of going through these three stages is a counterclockwise propagation of conformer 1 by one protomer. Continued cycling through
the three stages leads to a rotary sequential model for substrate translocation in Mtb ClpB. Conf 1, conformer 1; Conf 2, conformer 2.

Cryo-EM Data Acquisition. Purified ClpB diluted to ∼0.8 mg/mL was saturated
with excessive substrates including 2 mM ADP, 2 mM AMPNP, 2 mM ATPγS,
or 2 mM ATPγS, and κ-casein (catalog no. C0406; Sigma) in twofold molar
excess to ClpB hexamer. The mixtures were subsequently incubated at 4 °C
for 1 h. Three-microliter aliquots of the incubated sample were applied to
glow-discharged holey carbon grids (C-Flat Cu CF-1.2/1.3, 300 or 400 mesh).
The grids were blotted for 4 s at 4 °C with 95% humidity and were flashfrozen in liquid ethane using an FEI Vitrobot Mark IV device. For initial
evaluation, cryo-EM data were recorded on a Falcon II detector operated in
linear mode in a 200-kV FEI Arctica Talos electron microscope. Automated
data acquisition was performed with the FEI EPU software package. For each
sample, 300–400 movies were recorded at a nominal magnification of
120,000×, in a physical pixel size of 1.21 Å per pixel. Defocus values varied
from −1.5 μm to −3 μm.
Two samples, ClpB + AMP-PNP and ClpB + ATPγS + casein, were subjected
to high-resolution cryo-EM data acquisition in a 300-kV FEI Titan Krios
electron microscope with a K2 camera positioned after a GIF quantum energy filter (Gatan), yielding 2,535 and 3,537 movies, respectively. The FEI EPU
package was used for automated data acquisition. Micrographs were collected in the superresolution counting mode at a nominal magnification of
130,000×, resulting in a physical pixel size of 1.07 Å. Defocus values varied
from −1.1 μm to −3.0 μm. The dose rate was 10.0 electrons per pixel per
second. A total exposure of 6 s was dose-fractionated into 30 frames,
resulting in a total accumulated dose of 52 electrons/Å2.
Image Processing and 3D Reconstruction. The movies collected on Arctica Talos
were motion-corrected with MotionCor2 (25). Dose-fractionated movies collected on Titan Krios were also motion-corrected, dose-weighted, and binned
by a factor of 2 with MotionCor2 (25, 26), resulting in summed micrographs
with a physical pixel size of 1.07 Å. CTFFIND4 was used to estimate the contrast transfer function (CTF) parameters for individual micrographs (27).
Subsequent image-processing steps were performed using RELION 2.0 (28).
For each dataset, a set of manually picked particles was first subjected to 2D
classification to generate a set of templates. These templates were used for
reference-based automatic particle picking. The picked particles were subject
to particle sorting and subsequent reference-free 2D classification.
For the two high-resolution datasets collected in Titan Krios, we first removed contaminants and noisy particles by 2D classification as described
above and carried out further processing on the cleaned-up datasets. For the
ClpB+AMP-PNP data from 2,535 micrographs, 3D classification was performed using a map generated by cryoSPARC as the initial reference model
(29). The dominant 3D class with 112,043 particles was subjected to the final
3D autorefinement with a soft mask. This generated a 3D reconstruction at
an overall resolution of 6.3 Å, suggesting substantial flexibility of this
structure. For the ClpB+ATPγS+casein dataset from 3,537 micrographs, a
map generated by cryoSPARC was used as the initial model for 3D classification. The two most populated 3D classes were combined. 3D autorefinement of this dataset of 354,656 particles with a soft mask resulted in a 3D
map with an overall resolution of 3.8 Å. We found that the density for
protomer P1 was very weak in this map, indicating substantial flexibility in
the region. Therefore, a second round of 3D classification with six classes was
carried out, resulting in two different conformations in the protomer
P1 region. The most populated 3D class of each conformation was subject to
another round of 3D autorefinement, generating two 3D reconstructions,
conformer 1 at 3.8-Å resolution, from 108,111 selected particles, and conformer 2 at 3.9-Å resolution, from 76,666 particles. Finally, the particles
corresponding to conformers 1 and 2 were combined, and another 3D
autorefinement was performed, resulting in a combined map at 3.6-Å
overall resolution. The respective resolutions of the three 3D reconstructions
were estimated based on the gold standard Fourier shell correlation

0.143 criterion (30). The final maps were corrected for the modulation
transfer function (MTF) of the detector and were sharpened by applying a
negative B-factor, estimated by the postprocessing procedure in RELION 2.0.
Local resolution distribution was estimated using ResMap (31).
Atomic Model Building. Modeling of conformers 1 and 2 (ClpB+ATPγS+Casein)
was based on the crystal structure of E. coli ClpB [Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID
code 4CIU] (8). Using this structure, an initial Mtb ClpB protomer model was
generated with the SWISS-MODEL server (32). The protomer model was split
into two separate domains: NBD1 (amino acids 159–545) and NBD2 (amino
acids 546–848). We rigid-body docked NBD1 and NBD2 domains into the
3.6-Å average 3D map using the Fit-in-map function in Chimera (University of
California, San Francisco) (33). The docked models were improved by manual
adjustments and rebuilding in Coot (34). The rebuilding process was guided
by visible densities of many bulky residues such as Trp, Tyr, Arg, and Phe. For
the modeling of conformer 1 and conformer 2, six copies of the built models
of NBD1 and NBD2 domains were then docked into their corresponding
maps, at 3.8-Å resolution for conformer 1 and 3.9-Å resolution for conformer 2. After slight manual adjustments and rebuilding in Coot, the realspace refinement of the atomic models of conformers 1 and 2 against their
respective cryo-EM 3D maps was done using the phenix.real_space_refine in
PHENIX (35). In the last step, to model the MD domain in a lower-density
threshold, the initial motif 1 atomic model was obtained from the crystal
structure of E. coli ClpB (PDB ID code 4CIU) and was directly rigid bodydocked into the EM densities without further refinement.
The model of the tight protomer P5 of conformer 1 was used for modeling
the ClpB-AMP-PNP structure. After removal of the side-chain information, six
NBD1 and NBD2 domains were rigid-body fitted into the EM map using
Chimera. Then some manual adjustments were performed in Coot to correct
the large model deviations from the densities. Because of the low resolution,
this model was not subjected to further refinement.
MolProbity (Duke University) was used to assess the final models (36).
PyMOL (Schrödinger, LLC.) and Chimera were used to prepare the figures.
Statistics of the 3D reconstruction and model refinement are provided in SI

Protein Reactivation Assay Using Denatured Firefly Luciferase. This protocol
was modified from other reports (37–39) and has been described with M.
tuberculosis chaperones (4), which were purified as detailed in that report.
Luciferase (100 nM) was heated with Hsp20 (400 nM) in 5-μL aliquots for
5 min at 42 °C in 50 mM Tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (pH 7.5),
150 mM KCl, 20 mM MgCl2, and 2 mM DTT (buffer B) in nonstick tubes and
then was cooled on ice for 5 min (to give 2–4% luciferase activity relative to
native). Protein disaggregation/refolding reactions were performed by
adding the indicated amounts of chaperones and/or cofactors (DnaK: 6 μM;
remaining chaperone/cofactor: 2 μM each) in buffer B plus 1 mg/mL BSA and
were initiated by adding 2 mM ATP to a final reaction volume of 20 μL and
placing tubes at 25 °C for 30 min. Luminescence was measured by placing
2-μL samples into black 96-well polystyrene plates (Costar) and adding 100 μL
of luciferase reagent (Promega). Light emission was measured using a
SpectraMax L microplate reader luminometer (Molecular Devices) within the
linear range of the instrument, and analysis was performed with SoftMax
Pro software (Molecular Devices). An integration time of 10 s was used for all
measurements. One hundred percent native luciferase activity was measured using luciferase + Hsp20 prepared in the same manner without the
denaturation step, diluted in buffer B plus 1 mg/mL BSA, and incubated for
the same period of time at the same temperature. Reactions with ClpB and
mutants were done in triplicate in two independent experiments and are
shown compared with the same reactions lacking ClpB done in at least
triplicate. Percent luciferase activity was determined using Prism software as
percent of reaction luminescence relative to native luminescence for each
and then normalized relative to reactions containing wild-type ClpB measured in the same experiment.
