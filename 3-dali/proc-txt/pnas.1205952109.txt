ovalent posttranslational modiﬁcation (PTM) of proteins
greatly expands the coding capacity of prokaryotic/eukaryotic genomes, which leads to the production of much more diverse proteomes (1). Attaching different chemical groups, such
as phosphate, acetate, lipids, and carbohydrates to amino acid
residues in proteins allows these PTMs to ﬁne-tune functions of
proteins in response to various signaling events.
Among various PTMs, the reversible protein phosphorylation is
the most widespread in signal transduction, which is a central
process to the regulation of nearly every aspect of cell life, including growth, metabolism, motility, division, differentiation, organelle trafﬁcking, and immunity, as well as learning and memory
behaviors in higher organisms (2). In a typical phosphorylation
event, a protein kinase transfers the γ-phosphate from ATP to
speciﬁc amino acids of a protein to initiate signal transduction; in
eukaryotes, these phosphorylated amino acids are usually Ser, Thr,
and Tyr residues (3, 4). In contrast, His/Asp-based phospho-relay
of two-component systems has been well recognized as a classic
mode of signal transduction in the bacterial world (5). However, it
wasn’t until recently that eukaryotic-like Ser/Thr/Tyr phosphorylation in bacteria started to receive signiﬁcant attention (6–8).
Particularly, in pathogenic bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Staphylococcus aureus, eukaryotic-like Ser/Thr kinases
(and associated phosphatases) have often been shown to participate in virulence functions (5, 9–11). The kinase/phosphatase pairs
are known as Stks/Stps in bacteria; the kinase Stk1 has been called
as PknB or Stk, and the phosphatase Stp1 as Stp (9). Throughout
this study, we will use Stk1 for the kinase and Stp1 for the phosphatase because these names are more common in the literature.
Less common lysine and arginine phosphorylations have also been
studied (12). For example, in Bacillus subtilis, a speciﬁc arginine
www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1205952109

kinase McsB has been isolated and shown to phosphorylate arginine residues of its binding partner CtsR (a stress-response transcriptional regulator) in vitro (13).
Cysteine is one of the more reactive amino acid side chains in
proteins. The thiol group in cysteine plays a variety of roles in cellular
processes such as enzymatic catalysis, metal binding, signal [reactive
oxgen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS)] sensing, and protein folding
(disulﬁde formation). Thanks to its intrinsic reactivity, the Cys residue can be subject to a great number of PTMs that include alkylation
(S-prenylation, S-methylation) (14, 15), acylation (S-palmitoylation),
and oxidation (sulfenation, sulﬁnation, S-nitrosylation, disulphide
formation, and so forth) (14, 16, 17). The latter case enables Cys to
serve as a regulatory switch on proteins that respond to redox change
in their cellular environment (18–21). Despite these well-appreciated Cys modiﬁcations, Cys phosphorylation has long been regarded
as a rare PTM. Cys phosphorylation was ﬁrst discovered as enzymatic
intermediates in the transport of carbohydrates by the bacterial
phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system (22,
23), and later in the dephosphorylation of eukaryotic protein tyrosine
phosphatase during catalysis (24). Because of its “rare occurrence”
(likely a result of inappropriate assay conditions used in the past), the
regulatory role of Cys-phosphorylation as a type of PTM remains
elusive. Moreover, unlike conventional Ser/Thr/Tyr or His/Asp
phosphorylation, no speciﬁc kinase/phosphatase pair has ever been
recognized and designated for protein Cys-phosphorylation, not to
mention its contribution to cellular signaling.
Here we report the identiﬁcation of Cys-phosphorylation on
a number of proteins, including several global transcriptional regulators in S. aureus. We demonstrate that Cys-phosphorylation, mediated by the sole eukaryotic-like Ser/Thr kinase/phosphatase (Stk1/
Stp1) pair in S. aureus (25–27), signiﬁcantly impacts the function of
these proteins, thereby resulting in altered bacterial phenotypes.

MICROBIOLOGY

Protein posttranslational modiﬁcations (PTMs), particularly phosphorylation, dramatically expand the complexity of cellular regulatory networks. Although cysteine (Cys) in various proteins can be
subject to multiple PTMs, its phosphorylation was previously considered a rare PTM with almost no regulatory role assigned. We report
here that phosphorylation occurs to a reactive cysteine residue
conserved in the staphylococcal accessary regulator A (SarA)/MarR
family global transcriptional regulator A (MgrA) family of proteins,
and is mediated by the eukaryotic-like kinase-phosphatase pair Stk1Stp1 in Staphylococcus aureus. Cys-phosphorylation is crucial in regulating virulence determinant production and bacterial resistance to
vancomycin. Cell wall-targeting antibiotics, such as vancomycin and
ceftriaxone, inhibit the kinase activity of Stk1 and lead to decreased
Cys-phosphorylation of SarA and MgrA. An in vivo mouse model of
infection established that the absence of stp1, which results in elevated protein Cys-phosphorylation, signiﬁcantly reduces staphylococcal virulence. Our data indicate that Cys-phosphorylation is
a unique PTM that can play crucial roles in bacterial signaling
and regulation.

global regulatory proteins, which can respond to changing host
microenvironments (29, 30). Recent studies have revealed that
the sole and conserved Cys residue in SarA, MgrA, and SarZ (Fig.
1) acts as a redox switch to modulate the regulatory functions of
these proteins (31–34). However, in some cases oxidation of Cys
cannot fully account for the observed phenotypes, which led us to
speculate that other PTMs might take place on these proteins to
modulate their regulatory functions (35) (Fig. 1). Recent studies
suggest that both MgrA and SarA could be subject to potential
Ser/Thr phosphorylation mediated by a eukaryotic-like kinase
Stk1 in S. aureus, and that the phosphorylation modulates the
DNA-binding activity of these proteins (35, 36). Stk1-Stp1 is the
only conserved pair of eukaryotic-like kinase-phosphatase in S.
aureus. To investigate the phosphorylation mediated by Stk1-Stp1,
we performed in vitro phosphorylation assays on SarA, MgrA, and
SarZ using crude cell extract from S. aureus supplemented
with ATP.
As shown in Fig. 2A, SarA, MgrA, and SarZ were indeed
phosphorylated by cell extract isolated from the wild-type
S. aureus strain Newman. Intriguingly, we noted that the observed
phosphorylation occurred exclusively to the reduced forms of
SarA, MgrA, and SarZ, but not to their oxidized forms (Fig. S1 A
and B), which indicates that the phosphorylation of these proteins is highly redox-dependent. Subsequently, we tested mutant
proteins with the conserved Cys residue mutated to Ser. No
protein phosphorylation was observed for all three mutant
proteins (Fig. 2A), indicating that the conserved reactive Cys is
very likely the site of the observed phosphorylation.

Because Stk1 and its associated phosphatase Stp1 constitute the
sole Ser/Thr kinase-phosphatase pair in S. aureus, we tested their
roles in the observed phosphorylation. An in-frame deletion
mutant of the stp1 gene (Δstp1) was constructed. When cell extract
from the Δstp1 mutant was tested, the phosphorylation levels of all
three wild-type proteins were dramatically increased (Fig. 2A), yet
the corresponding Cys-to-Ser mutants were not phosphorylated at
all. Cell extract from the Δstp1 strain complemented with plasmid
pYJ335::stp1 (Δstp1-C), expressing the wild-type Stp1, gave reduced protein phosphorylation compared with that of the Δstp1
mutant (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, the recombinant Stp1 expressed
from Escherichia coli was able to remove the phosphate group of
phosphorylated SarA (Fig. 2C), MgrA (Fig. S1C), and SarZ
(Fig. S1D), supporting its phosphatase role. Consistently, overexpression of Stk1—the associated kinase of Stp1—in the wildtype background increased the phosphorylation level of all three
proteins (Fig. 2D and Fig. S2A).
Surprisingly, when we performed the phosphorylation assays
in the presence of high concentrations of DTT (10 mM), a widely
used reducing agent in biochemical assays, we found that phosphorylation of both SarA and MgrA were almost abolished
(Fig. S2B). In contrast, the phosphorylation of the kinase Stk1
itself, which is known to be a Ser/Thr type phosphorylation, was
barely affected by the DTT treatment (Fig. S2B). Thus, the

Veriﬁcation of Cys-Phosphorylation by LC-MS/MS. To further verify
Cys-phosphorylation of the SarA/MgrA family proteins, we performed mass spectrometric characterization on the phosphorylated proteins. Despite the labile feature of phospho-Cys (38), we
successfully identiﬁed the phospho-Cys modiﬁcation in both
phosphorylated SarA and phosphorylated MgrA (Fig. 3 and Fig.
S4). In the case of SarA, after trypsin digestion, one phosphopeptide INDpCFELLSMVTYADKLK (observed m/z 2182.0140)
was identiﬁed using the Mascot (v 2.3, MatrixScience) database
search engine (Fig. 3A) (39). The detected y6 and y7 fragment ions
showed that the phosphorylation was not on Thr-17 or Tyr-18,
whereas fragment ions b5 and b6 indicated that the phosphorylation was on Cys-9 but not on Ser-14. In the case of MgrA, one
phosphopeptide EQLpCFSLYNAQR (observed m/z 1550.6555)
(Fig. 3B) was also identiﬁed. The y7 and y8 fragment ions were
detected showing that neither Ser-14 nor Tyr-16 was phosphorylated in this sequence, and one y9 fragment ion showed that Cys-13
was phosphorylated (+80 Da mass shift). A mis-cleaved peptide
from the same sequence GSHMNLKEQLpCFSLYNAQR (observed m/z 2318.0482) was also detected showing one b11 fragment
ion conﬁrming phosphorylation on Cys-13 (Fig. S4).
Cys-Phosphorylation of the SarA/MgrA Family Proteins Is Blocked by
Oxidation and Alkylation. Protein modiﬁcations are known to con-

tribute to changes in cell physiology in response to particular signals. Pathogenic bacteria, such as S. aureus, require rapid response
to a hostile environment during pathogenesis. It is well established
that ROS serve beneﬁcial roles for host defense, particularly when
macrophages and neutrophils produce a burst of oxidants, such as
H2O2, to kill invading microorganisms. The abrupt change of the
redox status, on the other hand, is also used by the pathogen as
a signal to adapt and evade the host defense. The reactive cysteine
in the SarA/MgrA family proteins is known to be redox active and
plays a signiﬁcant role in responding to oxidative stress (40). As
shown in Fig. S2 C and E, in the presence of either H2O2 or cumene
hydrogen peroxide, the phosphorylation levels of both SarA and
MgrA were greatly reduced, supporting the ﬁnding that oxidation
blocks Cys-phosphorylation. Cys-oxidation in MgrA, SarZ, and
SarA is critical for gene expression regulation in S. aureus. The
same Cys residues can be phosphorylated, allowing the bacterium
to perhaps balance the oxidation-sensing pathways through the
same residues. Importantly, phosphorylation of the reactive Cys
residues in these global regulatory proteins enables the bacterium
to incorporate additional signaling pathways to affect/control
existing gene regulation networks.
We also tested nucleophilic alkylators that can alkylate the reactive cysteine. Both iodoacetamide and maleimide signiﬁcantly
diminished the phosphorylation of SarA and MgrA (Fig. S2 D and
F). In addition, we observed that the phosphorylated SarA is labile
to iodine treatment but not to pyridine or hydroxylamine (HONH2)
(Fig. S2G), consistent with a previous report that phospho-Cys
displays unique liability toward iodine (I2) (24). All these data further conﬁrm cysteine phosphorylation in these proteins.
Cys-Phosphorylation Modulates the DNA-Binding Ability of the SarA/
MgrA Family Proteins. To investigate whether Cys-phosphorylation

modulates DNA-binding of SarA, we performed an EMSA with

observed phosphorylation on the SarA/MgrA family proteins
represents a unique type of modiﬁcation chemically distinct from
conventional Ser/Thr phosphorylation.
A bursa aurealis transposon insertion mutant of stp1 (stp1-I)
(37) that deactivates both stp1 and its downstream cotranscribed
stk1 (Fig. S3) was used for the in vitro phosphorylation assay. Cell
extract from this mutant strain signiﬁcantly diminished phosphorylation of all three proteins (Fig. 2E), indicating that Stk1 is
essential for the observed protein phosphorylation. Collectively,
our phosphorylation results suggest that phosphorylation occurs
to the Cys residue conserved in the SarA/MgrA family proteins
and that the sole Stp1-Stk1 pair in S. aureus mediates this Cysphosphorylation.

SarA-binding sequence (Fig. S5E) (41) and therefore was chosen to
examine the effect of Cys-phosphorylation on the DNA-binding
property of SarA. The observed binding of SarA to the hla promoter
sequence is speciﬁc as SarA failed to show any binding toward the
promoter region of SAV2033 as a control, which lacks the consensus
sequence required for SarA binding (Fig. S5D). Compared with apoSarA [Kd (SarA) = ∼32 nM], phospho-SarA displayed a reduced
binding to the hla promoter region [Kd (SarA∼P) = ∼120 nM)] (Fig.
S5A). The treatment of phospho-SarA with the phosphatase Stp1
restored the DNA-binding ability of SarA (Fig. S5B), indicating that
Cys-phosphorylation accounts for the attenuation of the DNAbinding afﬁnity of phospho-SarA. Attenuation of DNA binding by
Cys-phosphorylation was also observed on MgrA [Kd (MgrA) =
∼102 nM compared with Kd (MgrA∼P) = ∼500 nM] and SarZ [Kd
(SarZ) = ∼35 nM compared with. Kd (SarZ∼P) = ∼120 nM] (Fig.
S6). Because glutamate (Glu) has been widely used as a phosphomimetic mutation (4), we further tested the DNA-binding properties
of three mutant proteins, SarAC9E, MgrAC12E, and SarZC13E,
using Glu as a mimic of phospho-Cys. Indeed, all Cys-to-Glu mutant
proteins exhibited reduced binding afﬁnities to their cognate DNA
[Kd (SarAC9E) = ∼134 nM, Kd (MgrAC12E) = ∼480 nM, and Kd
(SarZC13E) = ∼110 nM] (Figs. S5C and S6 B and D).
SarA, MgrA, and SarZ are dimeric proteins, in which the sole
conserved Cys residue resides at the dimerization domain and is
involved in hydrogen-bonding interactions with residues from the
other monomer (31, 42, 43). To unveil how Cys-phosphorylation
and the Cys-to-Glu substitution could impact DNA binding, we
constructed initial structural models of wild-type Cys-phosphorylated SarZ and SarZC13E based on the crystal structure of SarZ in
the Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 3HSE) as described in SI Experimental Procedures. Molecular dynamics simulations were further performed on all three forms of SarZ to explore the detailed
molecular basis. Time evolutions of centroid distance between
chain A and B of dimeric SarZ from their initial conformation (t =
0) were recorded (Fig. S7B). As illustrated in Fig. S7A, the wildtype SarZ displayed very little conformational change during molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and the distance between chain
A and B remained steady (Fig. S7B). However, a dramatic conformational change was observed in both SarZC13E and Cys-PSarZ during MD simulation (Fig. S7B). Particularly for Cys-PSarZ, the centroid distance between two monomers was sharply
shortened by up to 0.75 Å after 40-ns MD simulation (Fig. S7B)
and DNA binding domains of two chains almost clashed together
(Fig. S7A), indicating that Cys-phosphorylation introduces a signiﬁcant structural disturbance to SarZ dimerization. We attempted structural characterization of the Cys-to-Glu mutant proteins
to validate the MD simulation result and probe the molecular basis
underlying structural changes caused by Cys-phosphorylation. Although we were unable to grow good quality crystals of SarAC9E
or MgrAC12E, we obtained the crystal structure of SarZC13E at
2.0 Å resolution (Fig. S8). This structure shows the presence of
three strong hydrogen-bonding interactions between Glu-13 and
two Tyr residues, Tyr-27 and Tyr-41, from the neighboring
monomer (Fig. S8A). In contrast, only two weak hydrogen bonds
exist in the wild-type SarZ (Fig. S8B). Consistent with the result
from MD simulations, the enhanced hydrogen-bonding interactions between the two monomers, most likely existing in the Cysphosphorylated protein, elicit a substantial conformational change
in the DNA-binding domain of SarZ (Fig. S8C), with the DNA
recognition helix α4 of SarZC13E displaced by 6 Å compared with
that of the wild-type SarZ (Fig. S8D) (42). This observation suggests that Cys-phosphorylation of the SarA/MgrA family proteins
induces changes at the dimeric interface, thereby modulating the
DNA-binding properties of these proteins.
Phosphorylation of SarA Modulates Its Regulatory Function. To probe
the existence of Cys-phosphorylation in S. aureus, we expressed His6SarA (Δstp1-sarA/pYJ335::sarA) in the stp1-deﬁcient strain. The
phosphorylated SarA could be directly detected using an antiphosphorylation antibody after purifying His6-SarA from the stp1deﬁcient strain with Ni-NTA beads (Fig. 4A, lane 1). In contrast,
15464 | www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1205952109

there was no detectable signal for His6-SarAC9S (with Cys-9 mutated to Ser) obtained from the stp1-deﬁcient strain expressing
Δstp1-sarA/pYJ335::sarAC9S (Fig. 4A, lane 2), indicating that the
cysteine residue is the observed phosphorylation site of SarA in vivo.
SarA and Stp1 are positive regulators of α-hemolysin (hla) in
S. aureus (44, 45). Consistent with previous results, we observed that
either the Δstp1 or sarA mutant strain displayed reduced hemolysis
compared with the wild-type strain, as indicated by zones of clearance on 5% (vol/vol) sheep blood agar (Fig. S9A). Double mutation
of sarA and stp1 (Δstp1-sarA/pYJ335, a double mutant with inframe, unmarked stp1 deletion and bursa aurealis transposon insertion in sarA) led to further attenuated hemolysis (Fig. S9A). The
introduction of pYJ335-sarA into the Δstp1-sarA double-mutant was
unable to restore hemolysis (Fig. 4B). However, the introduction of
pYJ335-sarAC9S into Δstp1-sarA, with the expression of the Cysto-Ser SarAC9S mutant protein, signiﬁcantly enhanced hemolytic
activity (Fig. 4B). We further observed that introduction of pYJ335sarAC9E (a stable mimic of Cys-phosphorylated SarA) into Δstp1sarA failed to enhance hemolysis (Fig. 4B). Western blot analysis
showed that the production of α-hemolysin is very likely affected by
phosphorylation of SarA (Fig. 4C and Fig. S9B). Speciﬁcally, the
introduction of SarAC9S, a SarA mutant protein not subject to Cysphosphorylation, signiﬁcantly enhanced production of α-hemolysin,
but wild-type SarA, as well as SarAC9E (a phosphomimetic mutant), failed to restore the α-hemolysin level in the Δstp1-sarA
background presumably because of Cys-phosphorylation or Cys to
Glu mutation of SarA (Fig. 4C and Fig. S9C). These results indicate
that Cys-phosphorylation of SarA contributes to the attenuation of
hemolysis observed for the Δstp1 strain (Fig. 4B and Fig. S9A),
which is consistent with the weakened binding of the Cys-phosphorylated SarA to the hla promoter region observed by EMSA.
SarA also impacts the susceptibility/resistance of S. aureus to
cell wall-targeting antibiotics. The sarA mutant strain in the
Newman background displayed enhanced resistance to vancomycin (Fig. S9D), which could be complemented by expressing
SarA using the plasmid pYJ335::sarA induced by anhydrotetracycline (aTc, 1 μg/mL) (Fig. S9D). In addition to the sarA mutant,
both Δstp1 (Fig. S9D) and Δstp1-sarA mutant strains exhibited
enhanced resistance to vancomycin compared with that of the wildtype Newman strain based on plate assays (Fig. 4D and Fig. S9D).
We observed that aTc-induced expression of either wild-type SarA
(Δstp1-sarA/pYJ335::sarA) or SarAC9S (Δstp1-sarA/pYJ335::sarAC9S), but not SarAC9E (Δstp1-sarA/pYJ335::sarAC9E), fully
restored bacterial susceptibility to vancomycin. Collectively, these
data support that phosphorylation of Cys-9 plays a critical role for
the regulatory function of SarA in bacterial antibiotic resistance.
To further prove that protein Cys-phosphorylation is affected by
cell wall-targeting antibiotics through Stk1, we examined the phosphorylation of SarA and MgrA mediated by Δstp1 cell extract in the
absence or presence of antibiotics. As shown in Fig. S10, Cys-phosphorylation of both proteins was signiﬁcantly inhibited by cell wall
antibiotics vancomycin and ceftriaxone. A recent study in Streptococcus mutans suggested that carolactone, a bioﬁlm inhibitor, acts by
interfering with the function of S. mutans Stk1 (46). To determine
whether the reduced Cys-phosphorylation was caused by the inhibition of S. aureus Stk1 by antibiotics, we tested the autophosphorylation of Stk1 in vitro in the absence or presence of various
antibiotics including vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and erythromycin.
Intriguingly, as shown in Fig. S10C, the phosphorylation of Stk1 was
greatly inhibited by cell wall-acting antibiotics vancomycin and ceftriaxone, but not by erythromycin, a protein synthesis inhibitor. This
observation agrees with the effects of antibiotics on Cys-phosphorylation of SarA (25). Taken together, these results suggest that Cysphosphorylation of SarA plays important regulatory roles in bacterial
virulence production and antibiotic resistance and that cell wall stress
caused by antibiotic treatments might in turn serve one of the signals
that affect Cys-phosphorylation in S. aureus.

Discussion
Ser/Thr/Tyr phosphorylations are ubiquitous in eukaryotes (2,
50). These types of protein phosphorylations dominate eukaryotic signaling and regulation. Another common group of protein
phosphorylation is the bacterial two-component system that uses
His/Asp phosphorylations in signal relays in microbes (51, 52).
His/Asp phosphorylations are transient and unstable to almost
all enrichment and mass spectrometry detection procedures,
thus making direct observation and characterization of these
phosphorylations difﬁcult and challenging (5). The presence of
eukaryotic-like Ser/Thr kinase-phosphatase pairs in bacteria has
fueled interests in elucidating their potential roles in bacterial
signaling and regulation (53–55). The Stk1-Stp1 pair is conserved
in Gram-positive bacteria and has been suggested to play global
regulatory roles through Ser/Thr phosphorylation/dephosphorylation (6, 9). We show here that this kinase/phosphatase pair
can phosphorylate Cys residues in different proteins in Grampositive bacteria. Notably, the observed Cys-phosphorylation of
global regulatory proteins exhibits signiﬁcant regulatory functions, indicating the existence of a unique type of PTM that impacts biological signaling and regulation.
Despite the fact that cysteine is the most nucleophilic residue
among natural amino acids and is known to be subject to multiple
PTMs (56), Cys-phosphorylation was previously considered an
unusual PTM with only a few known examples as catalytic

intermediates in enzymatic reactions (24, 57, 58). We show here
that the conserved Cys residue in the global transcriptional factors
SarA, MgrA, and SarZ can be phosphorylated, which controls
virulence and other properties of S. aureus. Previous in vitro kinase-mediated phosphorylation assays have indicated that the
SarA/MgrA family proteins are subject to Ser/Thr phosphorylation
(35, 36, 59). Our present study establishes Cys-phosphorylation as
a main PTM occurring to these proteins. When the Cys residue was
mutated to Ser, the mutant proteins could hardly be phosphorylated by cell extracts (Fig. 2A), indicating that the Cys residue is the
major site of phosphorylation in the SarA/MgrA family proteins.
The labile nature of Cys-phosphorylation under common experimental conditions might have contributed to previous lack of observation of this PTM on these regulatory proteins and other
biological systems (38). To further support the observation that
Cys-phosphorylation can be reversed by DTT, we used S-phosphocysteamine as a model substrate to test the stability of alkyl Sphosphate toward DTT under conditions similar to those used for
the in vitro phosphorylation assay. As shown in Fig. S11, cysteamine, the dephosphorylated product, was observed after incubating S-phosphocysteamine with high concentrations of DTT
(100–200 mM) and Mn2+ (200 mM). High concentrations of DTT
above the physiological reduction range and excess of Mn2+ are
required to reverse Cys-phosporylation, indicating stability of this
PTM under physiological conditions. It is also possible that this
type of modiﬁcation could accumulate to signiﬁcantly higher levels
when bacteria encounter stresses such as ROS/RNS that shift the
intracellular redox balance or through other signaling events that
lead to activation of Stk1 or deactivation of Stp1.
Cys-phosphorylation could be more prevalent than previously
thought and detected if appropriate experimental conditions are
used. In fact, we found that Cys-phosphorylation also occurs to other
global transcriptional regulators such as CymR (at the sole Cys-25
residue) (Fig. S12), a recently identiﬁed oxidation-sensing protein
responsible for cysteine metabolism regulation in S. aureus (60).
Given that all of the proteins we have shown to undergo Cys-phosphorylation are global regulators that control a broad spectrum of
genes and properties in S. aureus, this study may suggest a previously
unexplored paradigm of Cys-phosphorylation playing important roles
in biological regulation in various organisms. We envision that certain
kinases may have evolved to selectively phosphorylate cysteine over
serine (or vice versa), even despite the near isostructures of these

MICROBIOLOGY

Given that deletion of stp1 inevitably accumulates Cys-phosphorylation among these proteins (SarA, MgrA, and SarZ), thereby partially impairing their DNA binding activity, we envision that deletion
of stp1 might render S. aureus less virulent in a manner similar to the
effects resulting from mutation of any of these transcriptional regulators. A mouse infection model of abscess formation was used to
compare the infectivity of the Δstp1 deletion mutant with the wildtype Newman. As expected, the Δstp1 strain was incompetent in
establishing infection in the mouse. As shown in Fig. 4 E and F,
bacterial loads in livers and kidneys of mice infected with Δstp1 were
dramatically reduced after 5 d. Compared with the Newman strain,
the Δstp1 strain showed a >2-log reduction (P = 5 × 10−6, t test) of
virulence in livers of the infected mice (Fig. 4E). The virulence attenuation of Δstp1 in kidneys of the infected mice was even more
striking, exhibiting a >4-log reduction (P = 1 × 10−7, t test) of bacterial loads in comparison with wild-type Newman (Fig. 4F).
