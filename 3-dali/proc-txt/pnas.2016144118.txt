O antigens are important cell surface polysaccharides in gramnegative bacteria where they extend core lipopolysaccharides in
the extracellular leaflet of the outer membrane. O antigen structures are serotype specific and form extended cell surface barriers
endowing many pathogens with survival benefits. In the ABC
transporter-dependent biosynthesis pathway, O antigens are assembled on the cytosolic side of the inner membrane on a lipid
anchor and reoriented to the periplasmic leaflet by the channelforming WzmWzt ABC transporter for ligation to the core lipopolysaccharides. In many cases, this process depends on the chemical modification of the O antigen’s nonreducing terminus, sensed
by WzmWzt via a carbohydrate-binding domain (CBD) that extends its nucleotide-binding domain (NBD). Here, we provide the
cryo-electron microscopy structure of the full-length WzmWzt
transporter from Aquifex aeolicus bound to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and in a lipid environment, revealing a highly asymmetric transporter organization. The CBDs dimerize and associate
with only one NBD. Conserved loops at the CBD dimer interface
straddle a conserved peripheral NBD helix. The CBD dimer is oriented perpendicularly to the NBDs and its putative ligand-binding
sites face the transporter to likely modulate ATPase activity upon
O antigen binding. Further, our structure reveals a closed WzmWzt
conformation in which an aromatic belt near the periplasmic channel exit seals the transporter in a resting, ATP-bound state. The
sealed transmembrane channel is asymmetric, with one open and
one closed cytosolic and periplasmic portal. The structure provides
important insights into O antigen recruitment to and translocation
by WzmWzt and related ABC transporters.

ABC transporter lipopolysaccharide
gram-negative bacteria

WzmWzt (16–18). In this pathway, the O antigen is first synthesized
in its entirety at the cytosolic leaflet of the inner membrane, anchored to an undecaprenyl-phosphate (Und-P) lipid. Following
completion of biosynthesis, WzmWzt reorients the polymer to the
periplasmic side of the inner membrane where it is transferred en
bloc to the lipid A-core oligosaccharide by the ligase WaaL. The
mature LPS molecule is then integrated into the outer leaflet of the
outer membrane via the Lpt pathway (19).
ABC transporter-dependent O antigen biosynthesis is similar
to wall teichoic acid (WTA) production in gram-positives where
the Tar/gGH ABC transporter secretes WTA across the cell
membrane (20). Further, an analogous process was proposed for
mycobacterial species where the Rv3781-Rv3783 ABC transporter ortholog is predicted to translocate an isoprenyl-linked
galactan (21, 22).
WzmWzt is a tetrameric exporter that has been crystallized in
nucleotide-free (apo) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-bound
states (23, 24). In both conformations, the transporter forms a
continuous transmembrane (TM) channel sufficiently wide to
accommodate a polysaccharide chain. Inside the channel, the
polymer is likely coordinated by aromatic and hydrophilic residues, as also observed for other polysaccharide-interacting proteins (25, 26). Strikingly, in the ATP-bound conformation, the
periplasmic channel exit forms profound lateral gates toward the
periplasmic membrane leaflet, proposed to be important for
releasing the lipid-linked O antigen into the lipid bilayer. It has
been suggested that WzmWzt uses a processive step-by-step

Significance
Gram-negative bacteria employ cell surface polysaccharides to
evade host immune responses, enhance survival in extreme
environments, and protect themselves against antimicrobial
agents. The outer membrane of gram-negatives is rich in lipopolysaccharide (LPS), comprising the endotoxin lipid A, a short
oligosaccharide, and a long terminal polysaccharide known as
the O antigen. O antigens extend the cellular envelope creating
a barrier that obscures the cell membrane to protect it from
complement component deposition and insertion, thereby
evading the innate immune response of the host. Understanding O antigen biosynthesis and how the specialized ABC
transporter WzmWzt translocates the O antigen for assembly
of mature LPS provides a molecular basis for manipulating this
fundamental process in gram-negative pathogens.

ell surface polysaccharides are ubiquitous features of microbial pathogens that enable them to evade innate immune
responses, resist desiccation, adhere to surfaces, and deter antibiotics (1–3). A vast array of surface-anchored and secreted
polysaccharides have evolved to extend the cell envelope surrounding and protecting the plasma membrane (4). To achieve this
defense, gram-negative bacteria employ capsular and lipopolysaccharides (LPSs), as well as colanic acid; gram-positives utilize walland lipoteichoic acids; and the mycobacterial outer membrane is
fortified by numerous capsular polysaccharides (2, 3, 5–7).
LPS is a glycolipid comprising lipid A, core oligosaccharides,
and a terminal polysaccharide known as the O antigen (8). The
O antigen extends the cell envelope and has been shown to
confer resistance to complement-mediated lysis (9–14). Its defensive properties are enhanced by its hypervariability among
gram-negative species, forming the basis for serotyping bacterial
strains based on the O antigen repeat unit structure (15). Additionally, the length of the O antigen chain can vary from only a
single repeat unit 3 to 4 sugars long to ∼100 sugar units, thereby
creating an efficient extracellular barrier (16).
The Escherichia coli O9a serotype exemplifies the O antigen
biosynthesis pathway that utilizes an ABC transporter, known as

translocation mechanism in which a cytosolic loop (LG-loop)
near the channel entrance interacts with and moves the polymer
toward the channel upon ATP binding (23, 24).
Some bacteria signal completion of O antigen biosynthesis by
chemically modifying the nonreducing end of the growing polysaccharide with, for example, methyl-, phosphomethyl-, or
β-linked 3-deoxy-D-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (Kdo) groups
(27). This capping reaction terminates polymer elongation, and
thus controls O antigen chain length, and primes it for translocation by WzmWzt (28).
A hallmark of ABC transporters secreting capped O antigens
is a carbohydrate-binding domain (CBD) extending the C terminus of the Wzt nucleotide-binding domain (NBD). The CBD
recognizes the terminal cap in the context of the O antigen repeat unit it is attached to (18). This interaction is necessary for
efficient transport of the lipid-linked O antigen across the inner
membrane in vivo. Structural analyses of CBDs from E. coli,
Raoultella terrigena, and Aquifex aeolicus revealed that the CBD
adopts a jelly-roll conformation and dimerizes by exchanging the
C-terminal β-strand between protomers (29–31). Mutagenesis
and in vitro binding studies with the E. coli O9a and R. terrigena
CBDs suggest that a concave jelly-roll surface forms the binding
site for the O antigen cap (18, 29).
We currently have separately determined structures of the
CBD-truncated A. aeolicus (Aa) WzmWzt in apo and ATPbound states, as well as the structure of its isolated Wzt CBD
dimer. Separately, however, these structures do not inform on
whether O antigen cap binding influences catalytic activity and
thus transport, which are important mechanistic questions. Here,
we present the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of
the full-length AaWzmWzt transporter in an ATP-bound state in
a lipid nanodisc. The structure reveals an unexpected position of
the CBD dimer and, more broadly, provides insights into how
biopolymer-translocating ABC transporters gate their central
channel and couple processive transport to ATP hydrolysis.
Results
To gain insights into how WzmWzt recognizes and transports the
O antigen, we determined the cryo-EM structure of the fulllength, catalytically inactive AaWzmWzt transporter reconstituted into palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidylglycerol (POPG) lipid
nanodiscs in a Mg2+/ATP-bound state (SI Appendix, Figs. S1A
and S2). ATP hydrolytic activity of the wild-type (WT) transporter after reconstitution into nanodiscs was demonstrated for
both E. coli total lipid extract and POPG nanodiscs prior to
structure determination (SI Appendix, Fig. S1B). The resultant
cryo-EM map has an overall estimated resolution of 3.6 Å and is
of excellent quality showing density for the vast majority of side
chains in the Wzm TM and Wzt NBD regions (SI Appendix, Fig.
S2 and Table S1). The initial map showed poor density in some
regions of the Wzt CBD due to flexibility. However, signal subtraction and local three-dimensional (3D) classification generated a second map of the Wzt dimer with an overall estimated
resolution of 3.6 Å, showing improved density for the Wzt CBD
subdomain (SI Appendix, Fig. S1 C–E). This map was used to
generate a separate model of the Wzt dimer.
Fitting the CBD of this separate Wzt model into the initial
full-length map allowed building an entire WzmWzt model. This
model includes residues 2 to 256 of each Wzm, excluding residues 48 to 54 of one Wzm protomer due to poor density of the
TM1–TM2 loop, and residues 1 to 395 of each Wzt, excluding
residues 242 to 252 and 241 to 253 of the Wzt protomers, respectively, due to disordered linker regions with missing densities
in the cryo-EM map.

topology comprising two Wzm protomers, each containing six
TM helices, that are coupled to the cytosolic ATP-binding Wzt
dimer (32). In addition to six proper TM helices, two reentrant
helices, PG1 and PG2, connect TM helices 5 and 6 and an amphipathic N-terminal interface helix (IF) lies perpendicular to
the TM helices at the Wzm–Wzt interface (Fig. 1). Further, an
extended loop between TM helices 2 and 3 inserts into the NBD
forming a coupling helix loop (CHL) in a similar fashion to other
ABC transporters (33). Wzt adopts a classical NBD fold featuring an additional gate helix (GH) extension that packs against
the interface of the Wzm protomers (Fig. 1A) (32).
As also observed for some E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae
serotypes, AaWzt contains a C-terminal CBD. Published structures of E. coli, R. terrigena, and most recently Aa CBDs show
that the isolated CBD itself dimerizes via β-strand exchange,
which is preserved in the full-length WzmWzt structure (29–31).
Our cryo-EM structure reveals the position of the CBD dimer
relative to the known core WzmWzt structure (Fig. 1A). Strikingly, the dimeric CBD interacts with only one NBD. Conserved
loops from each CBD protomer at the dimer interface straddle
the C-terminal helix of only one NBD (hereafter referred to as
“hinge helix”). This arrangement centers the CBD dimer under
one NBD at an ∼15° angle relative to the plane of the inner
membrane. In this position, the putative O antigen cap-binding
sites of both CBDs face the NBD dimer and lie within the same
vertical plane as the cytosolic channel entrances (24). However,
due to the special location and tilting of the CBD dimer relative
to the NBDs, the distances between the proposed cap-binding
sites on the CBDs and the GHs near the WzmWzt cytosolic
channel entrances are significantly different (discussed below,
Fig. 1). The overall structure of the CBD dimer is consistent with
its crystal structure in isolation, yet subtle conformational
changes near the ligand-binding sites could have functional implications, as discussed in detail below.
Although the structures of the TM and NBD regions are
consistent with our previously determined ATP-bound WzmWzt
crystal structure (Protein Data Bank [PDB] 6M96), we note
several functionally important differences. First, while the crystallized transporter contained only ATP and water molecules at
the active sites, the cryo-EM map indicates the presence of a
Mg2+/ATP complex for each NBD, allowing these to be built
into the final model (Fig. 1B). Accordingly, the side chain density
of the conserved Ser61 points toward the magnesium density to
coordinate the ion, while it points away from it in the crystal
structure (SI Appendix, Fig. S3). Placement of three water molecules into the final, refined model supports octahedral magnesium coordination (SI Appendix, Fig. S3 and Table S2).
Second, the short Wzm loops connecting TM1 to TM2 at the
periplasmic side of the transporter adopt different conformations in the crystal and cryo-EM structures. These loops point
away from the transporter in the crystal structure, due to crystal
contacts, and pack against the surface formed by the remaining
TM3–TM6 helices in our cryo-EM map (Fig. 1A). Third, the
continuously open TM channel described in the crystal structure
is narrowed and closed in the new structure (Figs. 1C and 2A).
Thus, the full-length WzmWzt cryo-EM structure is representative of an ATP-bound state in the absence of the O antigen
substrate, i.e., a resting state.
An Asymmetric Closed TM Channel. Previous WzmWzt crystal
structures in apo and ATP-bound states revealed transporter
conformations with continuous TM channels. These channelforming conformations are expected to occur during polymer
translocation (23, 24). In a nanodisc-reconstituted and ATPbound state, however, Wzm protomers are arranged closer together toward the channel axis, allowing contacts between the
previously identified aromatic belt residues (Tyr39, Phe180, and

Trp181) near the periplasmic channel exit (24), which close the
channel (Fig. 2 A and B).
The side chains of Tyr39, Phe180, and Trp181 from each Wzm
protomer are well resolved in the EM density map and establish
that these residues are indeed in close proximity, the narrowest
point being a 3.4-Å distance between the Trp181 side chains of
each Wzm protomer (Fig. 2A). A similar distance between
phenylalanine residues was observed in the human ABC transporter ABCG2 serving as an intracellular gate that seals the
outward open conformation (34). Further, the recent structure
of the WTA TarGH ABC transporter, homologous to WzmWzt,
also shows a closed state in which Tyr and Leu residues form a
similar, aromatic belt-like seal (SI Appendix, Fig. S4) (35).
A water accessibility analysis of the WzmWzt channel using
the software HOLLOW (36) with a 1.4-Å radius probe further
underscores the closed channel conformation (Fig. 2 C and D).
Past the aromatic belt, the channel is sealed by a hydrophobic
water-excluding region, indicating that our new structure is indeed a closed resting state of the transporter in the absence of an
O antigen (Fig. 2E).

Emphasized by the channel shape, the cryo-EM structure
represents an asymmetric closed transporter conformation with
only one open lateral exit (Fig. 2C). Superimposing the WzmWzt
transporter halves on their NBDs highlights the different conformations of the Wzm subunits in each half transporter. One
Wzm protomer is rotated as a rigid body around TM helix 3
relative to the other subunit by ∼9°, thereby breaking symmetry
in the Wzm dimer (Fig. 2B). This asymmetry results in closure of
one of the periplasmic lateral channel exits previously observed
between TM1, TM5, and PG1 in the symmetric ATP-bound
crystal structure (24) (Fig. 2 C and D).
In addition to asymmetry at the periplasmic lateral exits, we
also observe asymmetry at the cytosolic channel entrances adjacent to each GH, a proposed substrate entry site (24). Within
one Wzm–Wzm dimer interface, the open periplasmic lateral
exit coincides with a closed cytosolic entry site, and the opposite
configuration (closed lateral gate, open cytosolic entry site) is
observed at the other Wzm dimer interface (discussed below, SI
Appendix, Fig. S5).

Of note, the asymmetric location of the CBD dimer does not
bias the conformation of the Wzm dimer. Our initial 3D particle
classification identified a subset in which the openings at the
cytosolic and periplasmic sites are reversed, relative to the location of the CBD dimer (SI Appendix, Fig. S5).
Within the open lateral exit, we observe nonprotein density,
perhaps a partially ordered lipid molecule, between TM1 and
PG1 in the cryo-EM map, suggesting that the lateral exit can
accommodate lipid acyl chains (Fig. 2F). The bound molecule
appears to stabilize the open lateral exit. Other, lower-resolution
maps obtained during data processing lacking the compound
showed different lateral exit conformations with either wide
(open), intermediate, or narrow (closed) distances between TM1
and PG1. This demonstrates that the Wzm dimer samples different conformations in a resting, polymer-free state.
While the thereby-generated asymmetry of the Wzm protomers is
remarkably subtle, other examples of ATP-uncoupled conformational

changes of ABC transporters within their TM segments have been
correlated with large structural transitions (37).
WzmWzt Modulates TM Channel Width through Rigid Body
Movements. Despite the overall conformational differences ob-

served across all three available WzmWzt structures (apo, ATPbound open, ATP-bound closed), the Wzm protomers behave as
rigid bodies. With the exception of TM1, aligning the Wzm
protomers from all three structures shows that they are essentially identical for TM2–TM6 and the IF helix (Fig. 3A).
Aligning WzmWzt half transporters based on their Wzt NBDs
shows that while Wzm adopts a range of angles relative to the
channel axis, the CHL is found in a common position across all
structures, suggesting a path to couple ATP hydrolysis with Wzm
rigid body movement (Fig. 3B). Indeed, transitioning from a closed
to an open TM channel in the ATP-bound state (representing
resting and O antigen inserted states, respectively), involves the

rotation of a WzmWzt half transporter around an axis running
along TM3 and through the CHL, a central fulcrum (Fig. 3C).
Extending this analysis to the transition from ATP-bound to
nucleotide-free states with an open TM channel, as required during
O antigen transport, reveals a similar coupling effect. Here, transitioning from ATP-bound to the apo state results in further opening
of the channel and requires an opposing rotation of the Wzt NBD
and Wzm around the CHL axis (Fig. 3D and SI Appendix, Fig. S6).
Further, the increased diameter of the TM channel in the
nucleotide-free state, compared to the open channel in the ATP-

bound conformation, results from the increased distance between the NBDs, which moves the pivot points located at the
CHLs farther apart (Fig. 3D).

CBD loop faces Ala231 in the hinge helix, and the backbone carbonyl of the loop Gly306 hydrogen bonds with Ser238 of the hinge
helix. This knob-in-hole type interaction is further stabilized by a salt
bridge between Asp303 (loop) and Lys234 (hinge helix) (Fig. 4).
On the opposing side of the hinge helix, similar interactions
occur with the other CBD loop. Two knob-in-hole interactions
are observed, one formed by Phe305 (loop) and Ala237 (hinge
helix) and a second formed by Gly306 (loop) and Tyr233 (hinge
helix). Further, the side chain of Gln230 (hinge helix) is in
hydrogen-bonding distance to the backbone amide of loop residue
Asp308. The CBD loops are stabilized in an upright position by an
intermolecular glutamine bridge between Gln307 residues of each
CBD (Fig. 4). This intricate network of interactions explains how
the isolated CBD dimer supplied in trans can complement a CBDtruncated WzmWzt transporter by stimulating ATPase or translocation activity in vitro and in vivo, respectively (23, 29).

Wzt Exposes the CBD O Antigen-Binding Site to the NBD and TM
Domains. In the full-length WzmWzt structure, the putative

CBD O antigen-binding surfaces are oriented toward the NBDs,
rather than toward the cytosol (Figs. 1, 4, and 5). This transporterfacing orientation creates a direct interface with the NBD and
provides a means for coupling O antigen cap binding at the CBD to
effects at other transporter domains implicated in ATP hydrolysis
or O antigen channel insertion. Indeed, the NBD hinge helix,
serving as the attachment point for the CBD, contains the invariant
Tyr232. In both the ATP-bound cryo-EM and crystal structures, its
side chain points directly at H-loop His199, which is critical for
ATP hydrolysis (38, 39). Accordingly, O antigen binding to the
CBD could affect ATP hydrolysis (Fig. 4 and SI Appendix, Fig. S7).
Mapping important E. coli O9a CBD residues implicated in O
antigen cap binding (Trp286, Asn348, Arg402, Tyr404, Asp405,
Gly333, and Gly387) to the corresponding residues of the Aa
CBD (Trp362, Asn313, Asp364, Asn365, Gly298, and Ala348)
suggests functional similarities (Fig. 5A). Of these residues,
Trp362 is particularly important as its position is dramatically
different in the isolated CBD crystal (PDB code 6O14) and fulllength WzmWzt structures (Fig. 5B).
In all currently available isolated CBD crystal structures, residues Cys359-Ile363 begin the final, NBD-proximal β-strand of
the putative O antigen-binding site. However, in the full-length
transporter, Trp362 at the center of this β-strand is shifted toward the ligand-binding pocket and inserts into a cavity formed
by the conserved residues Gly298, Leu300, and Ala348. Further,
the β-strand immediately upstream of Trp362 is disordered and not
resolved in our cryo-EM map, suggesting that the entire Gly352 to
His361 region is dynamic in full-length WzmWzt (Fig. 5B).
The linkers connecting the NBDs and CBDs are also disordered in the cryo-EM map and were not modeled. At low
thresholds, however, weakly defined density extending from the
CBDs indicates the locations of the linker regions in multiple
conformations (SI Appendix, Fig. S8A). For the CBD closest to
the membrane, a 25-Å distance between the NBD and CBD
termini accommodates 11 residues, whereas for the other CBD
protomer, the 22-Å NBD–CBD termini distance would be bridged
by 13 residues (due to the different number of unmodeled residues).
Robetta structure predictions (40, 41) suggest that the linker lengths
suffice to span these distances in ATP-bound and nucleotide-free
states (Fig. 5C and SI Appendix, Fig. S8).
The 15° angle of the CBD relative to the plane of the inner
membrane places the two CBD ligand-binding sites at ∼54-Å
(membrane proximal) and ∼67-Å (membrane distal) from their
corresponding channel entry sites. Additionally, the interaction
of the CBD dimer with only one NBD offsets the CBD dimer by
∼21-Å from the central axis of the transporter, such that one
CBD sits directly underneath the center of the transporter and

Discussion
The proposed model of WzmWzt-dependent transport of the
Und-PP-linked O antigen starts with an initial tethering event, in
which the O antigen cap binds to the Wzt CBD, thereby increasing
its local concentration near the transporter. Reorienting the lipid
anchor then loads the O antigen polysaccharide into the central
channel, beginning ATP-driven processive transport (23, 24).
Spanning the distances from the cap-binding CBD surfaces to
the proposed channel entrances would require a polymer at least
10 to 15 sugar units long (assuming a length of 5-Å per sugar
unit). However, owing to the profound conformational flexibility
of polysaccharides, even significantly larger polymers could interact with the CBD and channel entrance simultaneously, in
accordance with estimated O antigen chain lengths (16).
Using the conserved Tyr232 within the hinge helix as a marker
for sequence alignments, modeling of the NBD/CBD interactions in the E. coli O9a and R. terrigena WzmWzt transporters
suggests a similar mode of interactions (SI Appendix, Fig. S9). In
R. terrigena, one knob-in-hole interaction could involve hinge
helix residues Ala244, Ala248, and Gly252 accommodating
Gln355 and a second could include hinge helix residue Leu255
“knob” fitting into a “hole” formed by Gly356 and Gly357 of one
CBD loop. Within the opposing CBD loop, this same double Gly
motif is well suited to accommodate Leu247 and Glu250 from the
hinge helix (SI Appendix, Fig. S9 C and E). Similarly, in E. coli O9a,
one side of the hinge helix likely has a knob-in-hole interaction with
Leu236 positioned adjacent to Gly341 of the CBD loop and, on its
other side, hinge helix Gly241 would face Gly341 of the opposing
CBD protomer (SI Appendix, Fig. S9 D and F). Thus, the off-center
position of the CBD dimer relative to the NBDs is likely a conserved feature of O antigen ABC transporters.
The CBDs are connected with the NBDs via disordered
linkers 11 and 13 residues long for the CBD closest to and farthest away from the membrane, respectively. An additional residue was modeled at the C terminus of the hinge helix (Asn241)
and the N terminus of the membrane proximal CBD (Gly253),
resulting in the shorter 11-residue linker. Due to the tilt and offcenter position of the CBD dimer and supported by weak map
density, the linker leading into the membrane proximal CBD
appears to sit right above the CBD ligand binding site, thereby
potentially occluding it (Fig. 5C and SI Appendix, Fig. S8 A and
B). Cap binding to this CBD would require significant conformational changes of the linker region and/or the CBD dimer tilt.
On the opposite side, however, a combination of weak map
density and Robetta models suggest that the linker connecting
with the membrane distal CBD is in a stretched conformation
extending away from the CBD ligand-binding site. Here, cap
binding is probably minimally affected by the linker, raising the
possibility that only this CBD interacts with the O antigen cap
(Fig. 5C). Further studies with the native, capped O antigen are
necessary to determine its precise interactions with the CBD and
assess binding site preferences, if any.
O antigen binding to the CBD has the potential to modulate
the hydrolytic activity of the NBDs. One such coupling mechanism may exist through disorder-to-order transitions of one
β-strand of the CBD. While residues 359 to 363 adopt a β-strand
conformation in the isolated CBD crystal structures, the region
from Gly352 to His361 is disordered in the context of the fulllength transporter, so that Trp362 can occupy the CBD’s putative cap-binding pocket on its concave jelly-roll surface (Fig. 5A).
Displacement of Trp362 (or similar aromatic residues in the
E. coli and R. terrigena CBDs) by the O antigen cap could then
induce conformational changes within the Gly352-His361 region
as well as the NBD/CBD linker that are propagated to the NBD
via the hinge helix to affect transporter function.
One candidate residue for modulating ATP hydrolysis is the
highly conserved Tyr232 located at the center of the hinge helix

(SI Appendix, Fig. S9A) (23). This residue points its hydroxyl
group at the H-loop histidine His199, a crucial motif in the hydrolysis of ATP (Fig. 4 and SI Appendix, Fig. S7A) (38, 39). Thus,
structural rearrangements of the CBD and linker region upon
cap binding could exert a direct effect on ATP hydrolysis by
manipulating the interaction of Tyr232 with His199. This is
supported by the observation that in the 2.05-Å ATP-bound
crystal structure of CBD-truncated WzmWzt, these residues
are within hydrogen-bonding distance, whereas they are more
separated in our cryo-EM structure (SI Appendix, Fig. S7B).
Subtle coordination differences of the H-loop and coupled networks could have profound effects on transporter function.
Further, Tyr232 also forms a knob-in-hole-type interaction
with the highly conserved Gly54 of the Walker A motif (SI Appendix, Fig. S7A). In the case of the LPS ABC transporter
LptB2FGC, replacing Tyr234 (equivalent to Wzt Tyr232) with
alanine (LptB Y234A) abolished LPS transport, underscoring its

importance for function. Notably, substituting LptB Tyr234 with
phenylalanine (LptB Y234F) had only a minimal effect on LPS
transport (42). Thus, the C-terminal helix of the NBD with its
conserved aromatic residue may function as a general modulator
of ATPase activity responding to different stimuli, such as O
antigen binding to WzmWzt.
Accordingly, we previously observed the in trans interaction
between the CBD-truncated WzmWzt transporter and the isolated CBD dimer with a corresponding increase in ATPase activity (23). This interaction, in the absence of the NBD/CBD
linkers, may stimulate ATP hydrolysis by stabilizing the hinge
helix and thus the conserved Tyr232.
Following O antigen tethering at the CBD, its lipid anchor
must interact with the cytosolic substrate entry site located at the
intersection of the Wzt GH and the Wzm protomers to initiate
transport. In a processive transport model, the pyrophosphateGlcNAc headgroup of the lipid-linked O antigen substrate would

then reorient through the TM1–TM5 interprotomer seam to the
periplasmic lateral gate, thereby loading the O antigen polysaccharide into the Wzm channel (Fig. 6) (23, 24).
Interestingly, our asymmetric cryo-EM structure shows only
one of the two cytoplasmic and periplasmic channel portals in
open conformations. These states likely reflect pre- and postreorientation conformations in which a wider cytosolic entry site
enables loading of the substrate’s headgroup into the channel.
The open periplasmic lateral gate is necessary for releasing the
headgroup toward the periplasmic bilayer leaflet while also
minimizing the physical translocation distance.
While previous apo and ATP-bound crystal structures suggested that WzmWzt exists in symmetrical conformations, O
antigen translocation likely requires an asymmetric function of
the ABC transporter. This is because the translocating polymer
would only interact with one CBD and enter and exit the TM
channel through only one cytosolic and one periplasmic portal,
respectively. The CBD O antigen cap-binding sites, as well as the
cytoplasmic channel entrances, are in direct proximity to the
active sites of the NBDs. Therefore, polymer-induced asynchronous ATP hydrolysis by the NBDs seems plausible, perhaps
resulting in staggered power strokes enabling processive translocation. However, elucidating these processes requires structural insights into a stalled O antigen translocation intermediate.
During processive polymer translocation, ATP binding, hydrolysis, and adenosine diphosphate (ADP)/inorganic phosphate
(Pi) release must occur while maintaining a continuous TM
channel that accommodates the polysaccharide. Our previous
apo and ATP-bound crystal structures each contain such a
channel sufficiently wide to fit an O antigen chain, representing
two conformations within the polymer transport cycle (23, 24).
In a polymer-free state, however, the transporter could undergo the same conformational transitions with a lipid molecule
sealing the channel, as previously suggested (24). Alternatively,
WzmWzt could undergo ATP hydrolysis cycles with a closed
aromatic belt, as observed in cryo-EM structures of WzmWzt
(ATP bound) and TarGH (apo) (35). These scenarios are not
mutually exclusive. For example, transitioning from the aromatic
belt-sealed to the lipid-plugged state would only require a small
Wzm rotation around the CHL axis described above and the
diffusion of a lipid molecule into the channel proper. Similar
transitions are conceivable when moving from a channel-forming
nucleotide-free state to either of the sealed ATP-bound states.
We thus propose a revised model of O antigen translocation
by WzmWzt establishing two paths for the transporter, depending
upon the occupancy of its channel (Fig. 6). In the absence of O
antigen (for example after releasing it on the periplasmic side), a
phospholipid can diffuse into the Wzm channel through the periplasmic lateral exit (lipid occupied) enabling basal ATP hydrolysis
while maintaining the permeability barrier of the inner membrane.
Following O antigen tethering at the CBD, reorienting the lipidlinked O antigen displaces the lipid plug and loads the polysaccharide into the channel (O antigen occupied). Repeated rounds of
ATP hydrolysis while maintaining the channel conformation drives
processive translocation until transport is completed. The transporter then returns to a lipid- or aromatic belt-sealed resting state.
The commonalities between WzmWzt and other ABC transporters implicated in lipid-linked polysaccharide translocation in
gram-positive and mycobacteria suggest that our findings portray
a generalized mechanism for how this unique class of ABC
transporters moves high molecular weight polymers across biological membranes (20–22, 35).

MSP1E3D1 Expression and Purification. Expression and purification of the
MSP1E3D1 membrane scaffold protein was adapted from a previously
published protocol (43). E. coli BL21(DE3) were transformed with
pMSP1E3D1 (Addgene plasmid #20066) in lysogeny broth (LB) supplemented
with 50 mg/L kanamycin and grown overnight at 37 °C. Overnight cultures
were diluted 1:100 into LB containing 50 mg/L kanamycin and grown at
37 °C until an OD600 of 0.60. Protein expression was induced by supplementation with 1 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) followed by incubation at 37 °C with agitation for 3 h. Cells were harvested by
centrifugation, resuspended in lysis buffer (40 mM Tris pH 8.0, 0.5 M NaCl,
10 mM imidazole pH 7.5) and lysed in a microfluidizer. Insoluble material
was pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 200,000 × g for 30 min in a Beckman
Coulter Type 45 Ti rotor, and the supernatant was incubated at 4 °C with
nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) agarose resin (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
After draining the supernatant, the Ni-NTA resin was washed with four
buffers: WB1 (lysis buffer with 1% Triton X-100), WB2 (lysis buffer with
50 mM sodium cholate), lysis buffer, and WB4 (lysis buffer with 50 mM imidazole pH 7.5). MSP1E3D1 was eluted with EB (40 mM Tris pH 8.0, 0.5 M
NaCl, 0.5 M imidazole pH 7.5) and dialyzed overnight against DB1 (40 mM
Tris·HCl pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole pH 7.5 and 0.5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid [EDTA] pH 8.0). The MSP1E3D1 His-tag was
cleaved by incubation overnight at 4 °C with tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease in the presence of 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and removed by reverse
immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) Ni-NTA purification. The
MSP1E3D1-containing fraction was dialyzed overnight against DB3 (20 mM
Tris pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA pH 8.0) for storage at −80 °C.
Nanodisc Reconstitution. Chloroform-solubilized E. coli total lipid extract or
POPG (Avanti Polar Lipids) was dried to a lipid film using an argon stream
and maintained under vacuum for 24 h. Lipids were then resuspended in lipid
resuspension buffer (LRB) comprising 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, and
100 mM sodium cholate. Final lipid concentrations of E. coli total lipid extract and
POPG after resuspension in LRB were 25 mM and 10 mM, respectively. The
nanodisc reconstitution mixture was prepared according to a 1:4:160 molar ratio
of WzmWzt, MSP1E3D1 membrane scaffold protein and lipid, respectively. Gel
filtration buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM lauryldimethylamineN-oxide [LDAO], 0.5 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine [TCEP]), lipid, sodium
cholate (15 mM final concentration), and LDAO-solubilized WzmWzt were
combined and incubated for 1 h on ice to form mixed micelles. MSP1E3D1 was
added and incubated up to 30 min on ice. Removal of detergents was initiated
by the addition 0.2 mg/mL Bio-Beads SM2 (Bio-Rad) followed by incubation at
4 °C for 1 h. The same mass of Bio-Beads SM2 was added a second time and the
mixture was incubated at 4 °C overnight. The next day, the same mass of BioBeads SM2 was added followed by incubation at 4 °C for 1 h. After removal of
Bio-Beads SM2, the nanodisc-reconstituted WzmWzt was purified on a Superdex 200 column equilibrated in nanodisc gel filtration buffer (20 mM Tris pH
7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM TCEP). Fractions of interest were concentrated with
a 100-kDa molecular weight cutoff filter for use in ATPase assays (WT
AaWzmWzt) or for grid preparation (AaWzmWzt E167Q).
ATPase Activity Measurements. WzmWzt ATPase activity was measured using
a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH)-coupled, ATP-regenerating
assay as previously described (23, 44) with the following modifications.
Nanodisc-reconstituted WzmWzt was combined with a buffer containing
50 mM Hepes pH 7.5, 4 mM phosphoenolpyruvate, 6 units lactate dehydrogenase, 6 units pyruvate kinase, 1 mM MgCl2, and 0.3 mM NADH. The
ATPase reaction was initiated by the addition of 1 mM ATP/Mg2+ and NADH
oxidation was monitored as a decrease in absorbance at 340 nm in a SpectraMax M5e plate reader (Molecular Devices). NADH oxidation rates for
WzmWzt-containing reactions were corrected for baseline NADH oxidation
in the absence of transporter before conversion to the ATPase rate. All
measurements were performed at 27 °C over a period of 60 min and repeated to generate averages of three independent experiments.

Materials and Methods

Electron Microscopy Sample Preparation. To prepare the cryo-EM sample,
nanodisc-reconstituted AaWzmWzt E167Q was concentrated to 1.1 mg mL−1
and incubated with 2.5 mM ATP and 2.5 mM MgCl2 on ice for 1 h. A 2.5-μL
sample was applied to Quantifoil Holey carbon grids (R1.2/1.3, 300 mesh,
copper) that were glow discharged in the presence of amylamine. Grids
were blotted for 7 s at 4 °C, 100% humidity prior to being plunge frozen in
liquid ethane cooled by liquid nitrogen using a Vitrobot Mark IV (FEI).

Cloning, Expression, and Purification. Cloning, expression, and purification of
the full-length AaWzmWzt transporter were performed as previously described, including cloning of the Walker B mutant (E167Q) by the Quikchange method (24).

with a Gatan imaging filter (GIF) and K3 direct detection camera (Gatan).
SerialEM software was used to collect 31-frame movies in superresolution
counting mode at 81,000× nominal magnification, corresponding to a calibrated pixel size of 0.53 Å/pixel.
A total of 5,938 movies were collected with defocus range of −1.2 to −2.2
μm and an estimated dose rate of 1.45 e−/Å2/frame. All movies were imported into Relion 3.0.8 (45, 46) for motion correction, dose weighting, and
twofold Fourier cropping to a pixel size of 1.06 Å/pixel using MotionCor2.
The dose-weighted summed images excluding the initial frame were used
for all image processing except for contrast transfer function (CTF) parameter estimation where nondose-weighted summed images (excluding initial
frame) were processed using CTFFind4 (47). Particles were autopicked using
the Laplacian-of-Gaussian-based method from a subset of 4,935 micrographs
and down-sampled to a pixel size of 4.24 Å/pixel for initial processing. Following several rounds of two-dimensional (2D) classification, a particle set of
804,216 particles was imported into cryoSPARC (48) to generate an ab initio

initial model. This initial model was imported into Relion to guide 3D
classification and refinement.
An iterative process of 3D classification and 2D classification followed by 3D
classification yielded a single class suitable for refinement. Reextraction to 1.49 Å/pixel
followed by refinement, postprocessing, Bayesian polishing, and CTF refinement,
yielded a final map with 3.6-Å overall resolution based on 48,174 particles (MAP1).
In order to improve the density of the Wzt CBD, a particle pool of 178,053
reextracted particles (1.49 Å/pixel) was subjected to signal subtraction to
remove the Wzm TM and nanodisc region from particle images. These
signal-subtracted particles were 3D classified using a mask over the CBD
dimer region only to yield a single class with improved CBD density consisting of 51,828 particles. Refinement of this particle set yielded a Wzt dimer map with an overall resolution of 3.6 Å (MAP2).
Model Building and Refinement. The crystal structure of the ATP-bound

(50) followed by real-space refinement in Phenix (51) in an iterative manner
to yield a final model of WzmWzt that excluded the Wzt CBD dimer. Separately, an initial model of a full Wzt dimer was prepared fitting the cryo-EM
Wzt NBD dimer and the AaWzt CBD dimer crystal structure (PDB code 6O14)
into MAP2 in Chimera. The full Wzt dimer model was then iteratively manually
refined in Coot followed by real-space refinement in Phenix against a postprocessed version of MAP2. The final Wzt model that was refined against
MAP2 was then fit into the postprocessed MAP1 in Chimera. The MAP2-based
Wzt CBD dimer model was then used to complement the MAP1-based model
of CBD-truncated WzmWzt to generate the final full-length WzmWzt model.
This model was refined in Phenix against postprocessed MAP1.
