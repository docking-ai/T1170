Posttranslational modification of ribosomally synthesized peptides
provides an elegant means for the production of biologically
active molecules known as RiPPs (ribosomally synthesized and
posttranslationally modified peptides). Although the leader sequence of the precursor peptide is often required for turnover, the
exact mode of recognition by the modifying enzymes remains
unclear for many members of this class of natural products. Here,
we have used X-ray crystallography and computational modeling
to examine the role of the leader peptide in the biosynthesis of a
homolog of streptide, a recently identified peptide natural product
with an intramolecular lysine–tryptophan cross-link, which is installed by the radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) enzyme, StrB.
We present crystal structures of SuiB, a close ortholog of StrB, in
various forms, including apo SuiB, SAM-bound SuiB, and a complex of SuiB with SAM and its peptide substrate, SuiA. Although
the N-terminal domain of SuiB adopts a typical RRE (RiPP recognition element) motif, which has been implicated in precursor peptide recognition, we observe binding of the leader peptide in the
catalytic barrel rather than the N-terminal domain. Computational
simulations support a mechanism in which the leader peptide
guides posttranslational modification by positioning the crosslinking residues of the precursor peptide within the active site.
Together the results shed light onto binding of the precursor peptide and the associated conformational changes needed for the
formation of the unique carbon–carbon cross-link in the streptide
family of natural products.
radical SAM enzyme

StrB (5). Homologs SuiB and AgaB carry out similar reactions
(8). As in the production of other RiPPs, streptide biosynthesis
requires an N-terminal leader sequence preceding the core
peptide sequence (5) (Fig. 1A, Top). Although such leader sequences are ubiquitous in RiPP precursors, their roles are still
under scrutiny. Mounting evidence suggests that the leader sequence directly interacts with the tailoring enzymes to act as a
guide that facilitates the modification (9). Recent crystal structures of the lanthipeptide dehydratase NisB and cyanobactin
cyclodehydratase LynD have shed light onto leader-sequence
recognition by RiPP-tailoring enzymes (10, 11). In both structures, the leader peptide forms an extended β-sheet with a domain that contains a winged helix-turn-helix (wHTH) topology,
which was recently classified by HHPred-based bioinformatics as
a RiPP precursor peptide recognition element (RRE) (12). Intriguingly, this study further identified the presence of RRE-like
domains in the majority of prokaryotic RiPP classes, including
those modified by the so-called SPASM-domain containing
radical SAM enzymes. Named after founding members subtilosin
A, pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ), anaerobic sulfatase, and
mycofactocin, this subfamily harbors a Cys-rich C-terminal domain that accommodates binding of one or two additional Fe–S
clusters. Notably, StrB, AgaB, and SuiB are also members of
this subfamily.
Significance

Ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptides (RiPPs) are an important class of bioactive natural products.
The tailoring enzymes involved in their biogenesis include radical
(S-adenosylmethionine) SAM metalloenzymes, which often install unusual modifications. The structural basis for substrate
recognition in these reactions remains unknown. Herein, we
present the X-ray crystal structures of a radical SAM enzyme
involved in RiPP biosynthesis. Our structures identify conformational changes correlated with the binding of peptide-substrate
and SAM. Surprisingly, we find that the peptide-substrate is not
associated with the RiPP recognition element (RRE) but rather
observe key contacts to the active site and an important, previously unidentified, bridging domain. These findings reveal
unanticipated roles for the RRE and additional domains during
RiPP biosynthesis by radical SAM enzymes.

P

eptide natural products have had a profound impact on human
health as sources of antibacterial, anticancer, and antifungal
therapeutics (1, 2). Broadly speaking, they may be synthesized in a
ribosome-dependent or -independent manner. The former category comprises the family of ribosomally-synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptides (RiPPs). Recent advancements
in genome sequencing and bioinformatics have led to the rapid
discovery of a multitude of RiPPs and their biosynthetic gene
clusters (3). Unlike nonribosomal peptides, which are assembled
by large multimodular enzymes (4), RiPP biosynthetic pathways
are comparatively simple and thus attractive targets for bioengineering (3). Biosynthesis commences with the ribosomal production of a precursor peptide whose core sequence is modified by
tailoring enzymes. Proteolytic removal of the N- and/or C-terminal
portions of the peptide, which occurs in most studied cases, followed by export of the mature product, completes RiPP biogenesis. RiPPs encompass structurally and chemically diverse
subclasses, such as lanthipeptides, cyanobactins, thiopeptides, and
sactipeptides (3). Most recently, a new subclass of RiPPs was
identified with the discovery of streptide. It contains an unprecedented lysine–tryptophan carbon–carbon cross-link and is
produced by many streptococci (5–7).

Radical SAM enzymes reductively cleave SAM bound to a
[4Fe-4S]+ cluster to generate a 5′-deoxyadenosyl radical (5′-dA·),
which initiates turnover by abstraction of a hydrogen atom from
the substrate (13, 14). In the biosynthesis of streptide and its homologs, hydrogen atom abstraction occurs from the lysine β-hydrogen in the precursor peptide (5, 8). The resultant lysyl radical
then reacts with the tryptophan side chain to create a cross-link
(Fig. 1B). Like other members of the SPASM subfamily, StrB,
AgaB, and SuiB, which install Lys–Trp cross-links in their respective
peptides, also contain a C-terminal domain with a characteristic
7-cysteine motif (CX9–15GX4C–gap–CX2CX5CX3C–gap–C), which
allows for binding of additional, so-called “auxiliary” [4Fe–4S]
clusters (15). Although this motif has been shown to be necessary
for streptide biosynthesis (5), the precise role of auxiliary clusters in
SPASM enzymes remains an active area of investigation (16–18).
Here, we report crystal structures of SuiB and thus a visualization
of a RiPP-modifying radical SAM enzyme. Using X-ray diffraction, we determined three structures that illustrate conformational
changes associated with binding of SAM and substrate SuiA. These
structures depict an N-terminal RRE domain positioned at the
entrance to the active site that appears poised to support precursor
binding. Surprisingly, however, we detect little interaction between
the RRE domain and SuiA and instead observe an α-helical peptide corresponding to the leader sequence of SuiA bound within
the catalytic barrel formed by the radical SAM and SPASM domains. We identify specific hydrogen-bonding interactions made by
a region of the barrel that is stabilized by an auxiliary [4Fe–4S]
cluster and a highly conserved amino acid motif (LESS) within the
SuiA leader sequence. Using computational methods, we further
demonstrate that binding of the leader sequence within the catalytic barrel facilitates conformations that position the core sequence
within the active site, bringing the cross-linking residues in proximity of the 5′-carbon of 5′-dA. Together, these results provide
structural insights into binding of the precursor peptide to SuiB and
the conformational changes needed for the unprecedented C–C
cyclization reaction.

Results
Overall Structure of SuiB. SuiB is encoded by Streptococcus suis and

is 96% homologous to the enzyme StrB from Streptococcus thermophilus. Both enzymes install Lys–Trp cross-links in their respective substrates, SuiA and StrA (5, 8). Purification and
reductive reconstitution of N-terminally His6-tagged SuiB leads to
an average Fe/S content of 10.4 ± 0.1 Fe and 9.0 ± 0.1 S per
protomer. To visualize the overall architecture of SuiB and the
conformational changes associated with substrate binding, we
determined three crystal structures (SI Appendix, Tables S1 and
S2). A substrate-free crystal structure of SuiB was determined to
2.5-Å resolution. Additionally, crystals were soaked with excess
SAM to yield a structure of SAM-bound SuiB to 2.5-Å resolution.
The highest resolution structure at 2.1 Å was solved for reconstituted SuiB cocrystallized with excess SAM and precursor peptide SuiA. Crystals did not form in the presence of peptide alone.
The overall structure of SuiB contains three functionally
distinct domains (Fig. 1C), described in detail below: the
N-terminal RRE domain (residues 1–106), the radical SAM
domain (residues 107–310) followed by a short bridging region (residues 311–346), and the C-terminal SPASM domain
(residues 347–437).
SuiB Contains a Canonical Radical SAM Domain. The catalytic core of
SuiB (residues 107–439) forms a hollow barrel composed of the
radical SAM domain bridged to the C-terminal SPASM domain.
Characteristic to many members of the radical SAM superfamily,
the SAM domain consists of a partial (β/α)6 triose phosphate
isomerase (TIM) barrel (Fig. 1D, blue) that houses the active site
[4Fe–4S] cluster in a loop immediately after the β1 strand (13, 19).
Contained within this loop (Fig. 1D, yellow), Cys117, Cys121, and
Cys124 form the so-called radical SAM CX3CXΦC motif (in
which Φ is an aromatic residue) and ligate three of the four irons
in the SAM cluster. As expected, our substrate-free structure has
an open coordination site at the remaining “unique Fe,” whereas
in our SAM-soaked structure, we observe intact SAM forming a

Fig. 1. The sui gene cluster and the reaction catalyzed by SuiB. (A) The sui gene cluster is highly homologous to str. It encodes a 22-mer precursor peptide (SuiA),
a tailoring radical SAM enzyme (SuiB), and a putative transporter/protease (SuiC). The sequence of SuiA is depicted with the 8-mer sequence of the mature
product shown in bold. Cross-linked residues are shown in red. (B) SuiB catalyzes Lys–Trp cross-link formation in SuiA. The new bond installed is shown in red.

(SI Appendix), such as hydrogen bonding between the main-chain
carbonyl oxygen of the hydrophobic residue Φ (Phe123) and the
N6-amino group of adenine (19) (SI Appendix, Fig. S1). Although
a canonical TIM barrel is composed of eight strands and eight
helices, the entire fold has rarely been observed among radical
SAM enzymes (13, 19). Instead, the C-terminal SPASM domain
provides a lateral closure in SuiB (16, 17, 20) (Fig. 1D, green).
The Bridging Region Provides a Critical Residue for Auxiliary Cluster
Ligation. Previous biochemical analyses with StrB and SuiB have

not unambiguously determined the number of auxiliary clusters.
Our structures clearly reveal two intact auxiliary [4Fe–4S] clusters
(Fig. 1E), similar to anSMEcpe, the anaerobic sulfatase maturating enzyme from Clostridium perfringens and the only other
structurally characterized member of the SPASM subfamily (17).
Full ligation of two auxiliary clusters in SuiB is enabled by an
eighth anterior cysteine (Cys321) within the bridging region. This
cysteine is located much farther upstream compared with previously characterized SPASM enzymes, at a position 26 residues
before the 7-cysteine motif (Fig. 1F, light blue). Following the
C terminus of the radical SAM domain, the β6a strand of the
bridging region dips into the barrel to provide this initial coordinating residue for the first auxiliary cluster, Aux I, before
exiting the barrel as a fragmented helix (Fig. 1 C and F). Although
the presence of a cysteine within the bridging region appears to be
common to many SPASM radical SAM enzymes (15–17, 20, 21),
the large gap in sequence appears to be unique to characterized
members within this subfamily and a key feature of Lys–Trp crosslinking enzymes (5).
The SPASM Domain Binds Two Fe–S Clusters. The SPASM domain
incorporates the auxiliary clusters around a β-hairpin and α-helix.
It is initiated by two cysteines, Cys347 and Cys365, which, in addition to Cys-321, ligate Aux I and flank the β-hairpin. The first
strand of the SPASM motif (β1′) interacts with β1 of the radical
SAM domain to extend the β-sheet within the barrel (Fig. 1 D and
F). Following residue Cys365, the 7-cysteine SPASM motif is
punctuated by the α2′ helix and resumes with the remaining
CX2CX5CX3C sequence. The first three cysteines in this sequence—
Cys406, Cys409, and Cys415—encircle and ligate the second
auxiliary cluster, Aux II, before the chain hooks back to provide
the final coordinating residue for Aux I, Cys419. The SuiB sequence then doubles back again to fully coordinate Aux II with the
final cysteine of the SPASM motif, Cys437, after which it terminates
at Leu439, in contrast to the extended C-terminal helix (α6′) observed in anSMEcpe (17) (Fig. 1F and SI Appendix, Fig. S2). Aux I
and II are located 16.0 Å and 27.4 Å from the radical SAM cluster,
respectively, measured between the closest atoms (Fig. 1E). As in
anSMEs, full cysteine ligation precludes a substrate-binding role

for the auxiliary clusters, a conclusion that is further supported by
the SuiA-bound structure described below.
The N-Terminal Domain Adopts an RRE Fold. As predicted by previous bioinformatics studies (12), the N-terminal domain of SuiB
shows structural homology with the archetypal RRE domain,
PqqD (22, 23). Although PqqD is believed to act as a peptide
chaperone for PqqE, the radical SAM enzyme involved in PQQ
biosynthesis, these two proteins have never been visualized in
complex (24–26). Our structures thus provide insight into the arrangement of an RRE-like domain associated with a radical SAM
enzyme. The RRE domain in SuiB is initiated by a three-stranded
antiparallel β-sheet that adjoins a trihelical bundle (Fig. 1F, red),
forming a wHTH-like motif that protrudes from the catalytic core
(27) (Fig. 1C, red). This domain is then anchored in a cleft formed
between the SPASM domain (Fig. 1C, green) and adjacent
bridging region (Fig. 1C, light blue) via an additional helix α4n
(Fig. 1C and SI Appendix, Fig. S3), placing the β-sheet of the
wHTH motif above the TIM barrel entrance. In the recent
structures of NisB and LynD, the leader peptides are observed in
between α3n and β3n, forming an extended antiparallel β-sheet
with the wHTH motif (10, 11) (SI Appendix, Fig. S3). Differences
in sequence between SuiB and its close homologs are also concentrated in this groove (SI Appendix, Fig. S4).
Recognition of the Leader Sequence by the Catalytic Core. The enzyme crystallized in the presence of SAM and SuiA yields clear
density for the leader portion of the substrate peptide (residues
−13 to −1) (Fig. 2A), while density for the core sequence (residues
1–8) is disjointed and difficult to assign. In contrast to the structures of NisB and LynD, where the RRE domains make many
direct interactions with the respective substrates (10, 11) (SI Appendix, Fig. S3), we observe the leader sequence of SuiA bound
within the SuiB barrel, adjacent to both the bridging region, which
provides the first cysteine ligand for Aux I, and the SPASM domain (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, the α-helical nature of the SuiA
leader, predicted from sequence analysis, is maintained within the
catalytic barrel before it transitions into a loop, whose contiguous
density terminates immediately before the core sequence, adjacent
to Aux I (Fig. 2C). While many RiPP leader peptides have been
shown to adopt α-helical conformations in trifluoroethanol, the
persistence of this secondary structure upon binding to the tailoring enzyme has only been observed in our structures and the
recent structure of MdnC, which binds the leader peptide as a
single-turn α-helix but lacks sequence homology to a typical RRE
(3, 9, 11, 28).
Recognition of the SuiA leader sequence is primarily achieved
through interactions with the bridging region (Fig. 2C). These
interactions orient the substrate helix and thereby facilitate proper
arrangement of the core sequence in the active site (Fig. 2C and SI
Appendix, Fig. S5). Perhaps explaining its high conservation in

Substrate Binding Is Coupled to Loop Movements. The three snapshots obtained in this study illustrate the conformational changes
associated with substrate binding by SuiB. Comparison of the
substrate-free and SAM-soaked structures shows minimal conformational changes associated with binding of SAM alone (average Cα rmsd of 0.285 ± 0.037 Å) (Fig. 3A, gray curve). In the
absence of peptide, we observe density for intact SAM bound in
the active site, suggestive of a preturnover state (SI Appendix, Fig.
S1). Crystallization with SAM and SuiA results in large-scale
rearrangements (Fig. 3A, red/blue curves). At the bottom of the
barrel, as oriented in Fig. 1C, the largest changes are seen in the
RRE-like domain and the α6 helix, which are angled farther away
from the barrel opening upon binding of SuiA (Fig. 3A and SI
Appendix, Fig. S6 A and B). These regions make a number of
crystal lattice contacts, making further interpretation difficult;
however, it is evident that the enzyme can accommodate significant motions, particularly in the RRE domain. In contrast, motion
at the top of the barrel is unencumbered by crystal contacts and is
dominated by two loops, L1 and L2, linked by hydrogen-bonding
interactions between the backbone carbonyl of Gly122 and backbone amides of Lys286 and Ile287 (Fig. 3B and SI Appendix, Fig.
S6C). In particular, residues 125–134 of L1 and 279–285 of
L2 adopt a new conformation in the SuiA-bound structure, which
occludes the active site. Interestingly, L1 directly follows the SAMcluster binding motif, and its displacement is likely a result of
SAM cleavage in the active site.
A Postturnover Conformation in SuiA-Bound Structure. In our SuiAbound structure, we observe two disconnected regions of density
in close proximity to the SAM cluster (SI Appendix, Fig. S1). The
first supports Met bound as a tridentate chelate to the unique Fe
through its α-amine, carboxylate, and side-chain sulfur atom, an
arrangement that mirrors previously observed post-SAM cleavage structures (29–31). This is consistent with prereduction of

SuiB with sodium dithionite before crystallization (8). Surprisingly, however, 5′-dA cannot completely account for the second
region of density. Instead, we observe intact SAM at this position
(SI Appendix, Fig. S1). In the absence of a suitable reductant, this
unusual feature possibly occurred following a single turnover, in
which dynamic motion of the enzyme trapped excess SAM in the
active site, perhaps poised to replace the Met bound on the SAM
cluster in preparation for another catalytic cycle.
The active-site hydrogen-bonding arrangement persists in the
SuiA-bound and SAM-bound structures, with additional hydrogen bonds observed from Glu319 and Arg272 to the methionine
moiety of the trapped SAM (13, 19) (SI Appendix, Fig. S1).
Further analysis of the 5′-dA portion of SAM shows that the 5′-C
of the ribose group tilts down toward the peptide substrate,
priming the enzyme for H-atom abstraction. This arrangement of
the 5′-dA moiety of SAM mimics previously observed SAMcleavage products in other radical SAM enzymes (29–31) (Fig.
4A). Together, these observations suggest that SuiB in complex
with SuiA is trapped in a post-SAM cleavage conformation.
Consistent with this post-SAM cleavage model are the shifts
observed in L1 upon SuiA binding. The adenine and ribose
moieties of SAM make all of the previously observed contacts
observed for the 5′-dA moiety in the SAM-only structure. As in
the SPASM-containing enzymes anSMEcpe (17) and sporulationkilling factor maturase SkfB (32), as well as the partial-SPASM
enzyme 2-deoxy-scyllo-inosamine dehydrogenase BtrN (16), an
additional aromatic residue directly follows the final cysteine of
the radical SAM motif. In SuiB, this residue is Phe125 (SI
Appendix, Fig. S2). While the position of the adenine moiety is
virtually unchanged between structures, L1 shifts to create an
additional hydrogen bond between the backbone of Phe125
and the N7 position of adenine (SI Appendix, Fig. S1). Concurrently, the Phe125 side chain flips to stack perpendicularly
with the nucleobase, creating a hydrophobic pocket that likely
would facilitate stabilization of the cleaved products (SI Appendix,
Fig. S1F).
Coupled together through hydrogen-bonding interactions,
changes in L1 result in coordinated rearrangement of L2. Furthermore, movement of Phe125 generates an additional interaction between its backbone carbonyl group and the side
chain of Thr282 (L2) (SI Appendix, Fig. S6C). As a result, the
residues of L2 move together to cap the barrel (Fig. 3B), perhaps
also inducing significant motion in the downstream α6 helix. A
comparison of surface renderings, with and without peptide
bound, visually confirms constriction of the channel supplying
bulk-solvent access to the active site from the top of the barrel
(SI Appendix, Fig. S6B). It is possible that, by limiting solvent
access, L2 facilitates a dielectric change in the active site, which
has previously been proposed to lower the free-energy barrier for
SAM cleavage (33). Intriguingly, an associated channel also
connects Aux I to SuiA, suggesting that loop motions may be
important for redox reactions involving Aux I.

movements. (A) Rmsd of the Cα atoms versus residue

unit are denoted parenthetically. Binding only SAM
leads to minimal changes (gray curve), yielding an
average Cα rmsd of 0.285 ± 0.037 Å, whereas additional binding of SuiA leads to greater changes
(blue/red), particularly in the loops L1 and L2. See SI
Appendix, Fig. S6 for additional views. (B) Visualization of loop motions upon SuiA binding. The

streptide precursor peptides (5), the LESS motif of the leader
sequence (residues −6 to −3) plays a particularly important role in
orienting SuiA by providing the only hydrogen-bonding partners
with SuiB. This hydrogen-bonding network is initiated by watermediated interactions between SuiA-Leu(–6) and Gly346 in the
bridging region and by Arg348 in the SPASM domain (Fig. 2C and
SI Appendix, Fig. S5). The SPASM domain further hydrogen
bonds with the backbone carbonyl oxygens of both SuiA-Glu(–5)
and, indirectly, SuiA-Ser(–3) through Arg348. The only observed
interaction with the RRE motif is made between SuiA-Glu(–5)
and Arg27 in the form of a salt bridge. The remaining interactions
occur with the bridging region and include Tyr344/SuiA-Glu(–5),
Gly320/SuiA-Ser(–4), Phe324/SuiA-Ser(–3), and indirect watermediated interactions with Thr318, His322, and Gly346 (Fig. 2C
and SI Appendix, Fig. S5). The buried surface area along the
peptide–protein interface spanning from the barrel opening to the
active site is 730 Å2, almost 51% of the modeled peptide’s total
surface area.

in our SuiA-bound structure mimics previously observed SAM-cleavage products from RlmN (pink) (29–31). The 5′-C of 5′-dA is marked with an asterisk. (B–D)
The active-site cavity of SuiB is shown as a white surface. The crystallographic model of the leader peptide is shown in gray. Rosetta-based simulations yield
low-energy conformations of the core sequence (blue) within our SuiA-bound crystal structure both with (B) intact SAM and (C) the methionine moiety of
SAM removed. (D) Simulations also yield low-energy conformations of the cyclized core peptide (blue) within the active-site cavity. (E) Of the five titratable
residues (shown as sticks) near the active site, simulations favor E319 (∼4.9 Å from the SuiA-W6 C7 position) as the catalytic base.

The Leader Sequence Helps Position the Core Sequence. The final
eight residues of SuiA are disordered in our crystal structure. To
investigate the possible conformations adopted by these eight
residues within the SuiA-bound crystal structure, two Rosettabased simulations were performed: one with the Lys–Trp-cyclized
SuiA and a second with the linear SuiA substrate. First, the cyclized
SuiA core peptide was modeled using NMR-derived constraints
for streptide (5) and placed in the active site of the SuiA-bound
structure using geometric constraints imposed by a peptide bond
linkage to the crystallographic model of the leader peptide. This
simulation led to SuiA placements showing considerable steric
clashes with the methionine moiety of SAM, which occupies the
5′-dA site. We next modeled uncyclized SuiA in the active site of
our SuiA-bound structure. This simulation yielded multiple lowenergy conformations of SuiA compatible with the crystallographic model of SuiB (Fig. 4B, modeled region of SuiA shown
in blue) displaying conformational heterogeneity (Cα rmsds of
up to 3.4 Å) that may explain the observed lack of resolvable
electron density in our crystal structure.
As the adenine and ribose moieties of SAM in our SuiAbound structure mimic the postcleavage conformation of 5′-dA
(29–31) (Fig. 4A), two additional simulations were performed to
model the final eight SuiA residues within our SuiA-bound
structure with the methionine moiety of SAM removed. Eleven
residues lining the barrel, including those that form hydrogen
bonds with the methionine moiety of SAM, were allowed to
sample other side-chain conformations (SI Appendix). Cβ of
SuiA-K2 was additionally constrained to within reasonable hydrogen abstraction distances (2.8–4.3 Å) from the adenosine 5′-C
(Fig. 4 C and D, dotted line). Modeling uncyclized SuiA led to
multiple low-energy conformations (Fig. 4C, modeled region of
SuiA shown in blue), suggesting that the leader sequence can
facilitate correct positioning of the substrate. In the final simulation, cyclized SuiA was modeled into the active site (Fig. 4D,
modeled region of SuiA shown in blue). Four clusters of lowenergy conformations were observed, displaying relatively high
backbone similarity (SI Appendix, Figs. S7 and S8). Of the 11
SuiB residues allowed to sample other side-chain conformations,
Gln26, Glu108, and Asn315 adopt a conformation not seen in
the crystal structure, while Glu319 and Arg272 adopt multiple
conformations, including those seen in the structure. Notably,
Glu319 and Arg272, which interact with the methionine moiety
of SAM in the SuiA-bound structure (SI Appendix, Fig. S1D),
form new interactions with the substrate peptide in these simulated models. In all of these conformations, Glu319 is the closest
residue to C7 of SuiA-W6 (within ∼5 Å) (Fig. 4E). Overall, these
simulations are consistent with a scenario in which the SuiA
leader sequence positions the core sequence into the active site
of SuiB for posttranslational modification.

Discussion
In addition to exploring the conformational changes that facilitate Lys–Trp cross-link formation, the crystal structures presented here provide insights into the functions of ancillary
domains that are prevalent in the radical SAM enzyme superfamily. As expected from bioinformatic analyses, the N-terminal
domain in SuiB adopts a RRE fold that is docked at the opening
of the radical SAM catalytic core, poised to mediate peptide
delivery. However, rather than binding to the RRE domain, we
observe the SuiA leader peptide primarily interacting with
the catalytic barrel. Unique among published RRE-containing
structures, this discovery not only elucidates leader peptide
function but also provides insights into the role of the RRE
domain during catalysis. Simulations of the core sequence further support the role of the leader peptide in guiding posttranslational modifications, while the observed interactions
between SuiA and SuiB highlight the importance of a bridging
loop linking the radical SAM and SPASM domains. As only the
second crystallographically characterized radical SAM enzyme
to contain three [4Fe–4S] clusters, SuiB provides additional
insights into the SPASM domain and the RRE domain and
highlights the unsuspected importance of the bridging domain
during catalysis (34).
While more than a third of SPASM-containing enzymes include a cysteine in the bridging region (35), the prevalence of
fully ligated auxiliary clusters is unknown. Coordination of the
upstream cysteine in SuiB precludes direct substrate binding and
establishes this feature, first observed in anSMEcpe, as a significant auxiliary cluster-binding motif. There are, however,
critical differences between SuiB and anSMEcpe, including the
remote position of the upstream cysteine and fragmentation of
the α6a helix (SI Appendix, Fig. S9). In addition, the arrangement
of the bridging region is indicative of a structural role for Aux I
that is further supported by mutagenesis studies, in which
C347A/C365A mutants are recalcitrant to purification (8). This
region further provides critical contacts for both SuiA and the
peptidyl substrate surrogates of anSMEcpe and likely serves a
similar binding role in other SPASM-containing enzymes. Thus,
variability in the bridging region from one enzyme to another
may indicate adaption to the cognate peptide substrate.
Although structural insights remain scarce (10, 11, 23, 36, 37),
recent bioinformatic identification of an RRE motif across all
RiPP classes has provided invaluable clues to understanding
interactions between RiPP precursor peptides and tailoring
enzymes. Supported by structural and biochemical analyses,
this domain has been implicated in peptide recognition and
recruitment. Intriguingly, the structures of SuiB provide an
example of a precursor binding location distinct from the
RRE domain. This unique SuiA-binding mode suggests that

precursor peptides and tailoring enzymes more generally. The
structures presented here further demonstrate that the mode of
substrate binding greatly contributes to structural diversity within
ancillary domains of the radical SAM superfamily. In particular,
we gain a newfound appreciation for the bridging region between
the SAM and SPASM domains. It will be fascinating to see if
future investigations into peptide recognition and recruitment by
RiPP-modifying enzymes uncover similar interactions between
distinct RRE and catalytic domains, especially those involving
radical SAM enzymes like the PqqD/PqqE system.

the RRE-like domain in SuiB is either vestigial or involved in an
undetected interaction. Observed motion of the N-terminal domain appears to support the latter, and one can envision a simple
scenario in which the RRE both recognizes the peptide and delivers it to the active site but at a certain stage in the catalytic cycle
releases the precursor peptide. Recent biochemical analysis of the
PqqD/PqqE system not only detected peptide binding to the canonical RRE but also confirmed interaction between the peptide
chaperone and radical SAM enzyme. Perhaps the RRE domain in
SuiB serves as a similar intermediate binding site (12).
The observed location of SuiA within the barrel may provide
insights into mechanism of SuiB. In the catalytic scheme proposed, an active site base facilitates rearomatization by deprotonating the putative tryptophanyl radical intermediate followed
by electron transfer to an auxiliary cluster (5). Inspection of the
barrel interior yields five possible titratable side chains within
∼10 Å of the adenosine 5′-carbon: Glu319, Glu108, Glu355,
Tyr112, and Lys353 (Fig. 4E). The positions of simulated Lys–
Trp cross-link conformations, supported by alignments with
substrate-bound structures of anSMEcpe and RlmN (SI Appendix, Fig. S10), favor Glu319 for direct active-site deprotonation
(Fig. 4E). In this step of the catalytic cycle, Aux II is clearly an
unsuitable direct electron acceptor, as it is too far removed from
the active site. Electron transfer likely proceeds to Aux I first.
Decreased access to bulk solvent as a function of loop movements could then justify electron transfer from Aux I to Aux II
and then to a protein redox partner (38).
In conclusion, we present a sequence of structures that not
only helps to elucidate the formation of a streptide C–C crosslink but also provides insights into the interplay between RiPP
