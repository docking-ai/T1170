The mammalian mitochondrial ribosomes (mitoribosomes) are
responsible for synthesizing 13 membrane proteins that form
essential components of the complexes involved in oxidative
phosphorylation or ATP generation for the eukaryotic cell. The
mammalian 55S mitoribosome contains significantly smaller
rRNAs and a large mass of mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (MRPs),
including large mito-specific amino acid extensions and insertions
in MRPs that are homologous to bacterial ribosomal proteins and
an additional 35 mito-specific MRPs. Here we present the cryo-EM
structure analysis of the small (28S) subunit (SSU) of the 55S
mitoribosome. We find that the mito-specific extensions in homologous MRPs generally are involved in inter-MRP contacts and
in contacts with mito-specific MRPs, suggesting a stepwise evolution of the current architecture of the mitoribosome. Although most
of the mito-specific MRPs and extensions of homologous MRPs are
situated on the peripheral regions, they also contribute significantly
to the formation of linings of the mRNA and tRNA paths, suggesting
a tailor-made structural organization of the mito-SSU for the recruitment of mito-specific mRNAs, most of which do not possess a 5′
leader sequence. In addition, docking of previously published coordinates of the large (39S) subunit (LSU) into the cryo-EM map of the
55S mitoribosome reveals that mito-specific MRPs of both the SSU
and LSU are involved directly in the formation of six of the 15
intersubunit bridges.

partial molecular models of the 39S subunit have been published
at 12.1-Å (6) and more recently at ∼5-Å (11) resolution. Here we
present the 7-Å cryo-EM structure of the 28S mito-SSU, which is
composed of a 12S rRNA molecule and 31 MRPs [numbered
S2 to S39, with gaps (12)]. Fifteen of the 31 MRPs are homologous to bacterial ribosomal proteins, most of which (except for MRPs S6 and S12) have accrued mito-specific N-terminal
and/or C-terminal amino acid extensions (NTE and CTE, respectively) of varying lengths (Table S1). No homologs for six bacterial
ribosomal proteins—S1, S4, S8, S13, S19, and S20—are found in
the mito-SSU. We have modeled the complete 12S rRNA, all of
the 15 homologous MRPs, and their mito-specific extensions
into the cryo-EM density. In addition, we have made an attempt
to identify densities for the 16 mito-specific MRPs within the
cryo-EM map. Strategic locations of some of the mito-specific
MRPs and mito-specific extensions in homologous MRPs on
the mito-SSU structure suggest their direct involvement in the
recruitment of the unique mitochondrial mRNAs (13).
Results and Discussion
The density corresponding to the 28S SSU was well resolved in
most part in our 7.0-Å resolution cryo-EM map of the 55S

The mitochondrial ribosome (mitoribosome) is a macromolecular
complex that plays a central role in mitochondrial protein synthesis. Its small subunit is involved directly in the recruitment
and decoding of mitochondrial mRNAs. Defects in mitochondrial
translation, including mutations in components of the mitoribosome, are known to cause numerous human genetic diseases.
Thus, knowledge of the molecular architecture of the mitoribosome is essential for a better understanding of those diseases
and of the process of translation. To our knowledge, this article
describes the first detailed cryo-EM structure of the small subunit
of the mammalian mitoribosome. The study provides important
clues about the evolution of this macromolecular complex and
reveals unique structural features that could be important in the
translation of the unusual mitochondrial mRNAs.

T

he mammalian mitochondrial genome encodes 37 genes,
including two ribosomal RNAs (12S and 16S rRNAs), 22
mitochondrial tRNAs, and 13 polypeptides of the oxidative
phosphorylation complexes. All the proteins required for mammalian mitochondrial translation, including mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (MRPs), are encoded in the nuclear genome,
translated in the cytoplasm, and then imported into the mitochondrion. Defects in several components of the mammalian
mitochondrial translational machinery are involved in a number
of human genetic diseases (1–3). Thus, knowledge of the molecular architecture of the mitochondrial translational machinery
is important for a better understanding these diseases. Previous
low-resolution cryo-EM studies (4–6) have revealed several
unique structural features of the mitoribosomes. Because mitochondria are thought to have originated through an early endosymbiotic event between an α-protobacteria and a primitive
host cell (7), its ribosomes were proposed to be structurally
similar to those of bacteria. However, the overall 3D structure of
the mammalian mitoribosome was found to be significantly altered and porous (4) as compared with its bacterial and eukaryotic cytoplasmic counterparts (8–10).
The functional 55S mammalian mitoribosome is made up of
two unequally sized subunits referred to as the small (SSU, 28S)
and large (LSU, 39S) subunits. The LSU is involved in catalyzing
the peptidyl-transferase reaction, and the SSU provides the platform for mRNA binding and decoding. Based on cryo-EM studies,

Densities shown as solid yellow did not match homology models but also have
been tentatively assigned, and densities marked with asterisks (*) would correspond to undocked portions of MRP S27 and S30 models. The mito-SSU is
shown from the interface side in A and C and from the solvent side in B and D.

Kaushal et al.

Using this approach, we have tentatively positioned and docked
models for 12 of the 16 mito-specific MRPs within the mito-SSU
map (Fig. 1 C and D and Table S3). However, further structural
characterization at higher resolution would be required for more
precise placement of the mito-specific MRPs. Like other ribosomal SSUs, the mito-SSU map could be divided readily into
three major structural domains, namely, the body, head, and
platform. The molecular architectures of these domains are described in the next three sections.
SSU Body. As in cytoplasmic ribosomes, the 5′ major domain and
a significant portion of the 3′ minor domain of the 12S rRNA
(Fig. S2) provide the basic scaffold for the SSU body. Helix 44,
which encompasses the mRNA decoding site and runs vertically
through the main body on the subunit interface side (Fig. 1C),
also is known to carry multiple genetic disease hotspots (15). (We
use the bacterial numbering to refer to rRNA helices throughout,
and henceforth helices are identified by a number prefixed with
the letter “h.”) We find that the overall conformation of h44 is
significantly altered in the mito-SSU compared with its conformation in the SSUs of cytoplasmic ribosomes (Fig. S2F). Specifically, the lower portion of h44 is oriented slightly toward the
platform side of the body. However, the lowermost region of h44
is partially disordered in our map, suggesting dynamic behavior
of that region in the mitoribosome.
Among the conserved MRPs of the SSU body, S5 possesses
large extensions at both its N and C termini (Table S1). Its NTE
occupies a small portion of the structure previously described as
the mRNA gate (4) and interacts with the largest of the mitospecific MRP densities, tentatively assigned to MRP S39 (or
PTCD3) (12, 16), which emerges from the SSU head on the
solvent side, and with the conserved domain of MRP S2 (Fig.
2A). On the solvent side, MRP S5 also interacts with densities
assigned to several mito-specific MRPs, i.e., S28, S29, and S37
(Figs. 1D and 2A). Although the structure and position of MRP
S12 on the mito-SSU body are highly conserved, the orientation
of MRP S15, which is located at the junction of the SSU body
and platform, is altered as compared with its orientation in the
bacterial SSU. MRP S15 carries both an NTE and CTE that are
oriented on the solvent side of the conserved domain of the
protein (Fig. 2B). The CTE of MRP S15 interacts with the CTE
of MRP S17, whereas both the CTE and NTE of MRP S15 and
the CTE of MRP S17 interact with densities assigned to mitospecific MRPs S26 and S28. The CTEs of both MRPs S15 and
S17 partially replace a small stretch of bacterial h21, which is
absent in the mito-SSU (Fig. S2 A and E). Interestingly, although
MRP S17 has lost almost all its rRNA-binding sites in the mitorRNA because of deletion of the binding rRNA helices or conformational changes associated with those deletions (Fig. S6A), it
retains its place in the mitoribosome. However, it is reoriented,
and its interactions are redefined in the mito-SSU where it makes
major interactions with partially truncated h11 (Fig. S6A).
Except for h17 and h21, most of the bacterial rRNA helices
that are known to interact with the Escherichia coli counterpart
of S16 (ecS16; henceforth the prefix “ec” refers to the E. coli
counterpart of an MRP) also are conserved in the mitoribosome
(Fig. S2). MRP S16 has a 38-aa CTE that interacts with densities
assigned to two mito-specific MRPs, S26 and S30 (Fig. 3A). A
nonsense mutation in human MRP S16, from the Agr111 codon
to a stop codon, leads to agenesis of the corpus callosum, dysmorphism, and fatal neonatal lactic acidosis (17). Because S16 is
an assembly protein, the nonsense mutation would affect the
assembly of the mito-SSU directly by disrupting interactions with
mito-specific MRPs (Fig. 3B) and thereby impairing mitochondrial protein synthesis (18, 19).
The mito-specific MRP S29 is a GTP-binding protein and has
been identified as death-associated protein 3 (DAP3), which
promotes apoptosis (20). The density region assigned to MRP

mitoribosome (Fig. S1), allowing modeling of the complete 12S
rRNA molecule (Fig. S2) and 15 homologous MRPs and their
mito-specific extensions (Fig. S1C). Although several peripheral
bacterial rRNA helices are either truncated or completely lost in
the mito-rRNAs (Fig. S2 and refs. 4 and 10), the tertiary structure of the core of the 12S rRNA and the overall positions of all
homologous MRPs are preserved in the mito-SSU structure.
However, the mito-specific extensions of the homologous MRPs
are primarily oriented and exposed on the solvent side of the
mito-SSU, as are the majority of the mito-specific MRPs (Fig. 1
A and B). To localize densities corresponding to the remaining
16 mito-specific MRPs (molecular mass, 11.5–77.8 kDa) (12)
that do not share any significant sequence identity with the
known protein structures, we took a comprehensive approach,
including information available from immuno-EM, application
of Segger-based multiple segmentation (14), matching the structural features of each segmented density with the ab initio model
of the MRP, and establishing a correlation between the size of
each segmented density and the molecular mass of the mitospecific MRPs (Methods and Materials, Table S2, and Figs. S3–S5).

a number indicates the 12 rRNA helix. As in Fig. 1 C and D, docked models of
mito-specific MRPs are shown along with their cryo-EM densities (meshwork), and undocked densities are shown as solid masses in this and subsequent figures. Thumbnails to the left in this and subsequent figures show
the overall orientations of the mito-SSU.

S29 on the mito-SSU also was ascertained previously by immunoEM (21). This mito-specific MRP interacts with MRPs S5 and
with densities assigned to the mito-specific MRPs S28 and S37
(Figs. 1D and 2). The density assigned to MRP S37 is located
close to the mRNA entry site on the solvent side of the SSU body,
such that it interacts with h18 and MRP S5 (Figs. 1D and 2B) and
partially occupies the positions of the bacterial S4 and h16 of the
16S rRNA (both absent in the mito-SSU) (Figs. 2B and 5B). The
lowest portion of the SSU body carries a large mito-specific MRP
mass of density (Fig. 1), previously termed the “lower body lobe”
(4), which interacts with rRNA helices h15, h44, and the apical
region of h6. The segmentation of this complex mass of density
and motif matching suggest that this region contains three tightly
interacting mito-specific MRPs, identified as S27, S30, and S31
(Fig. 1 C and D). The density corresponding to the lower body
finger (4) appears to represent an unmodeled part of MRP S30
(Fig. 1C).
SSU Head. Even though the 3′ major domain of the 12S rRNA

(Fig. S2) provides its main scaffold, the head of the mito-SSU is
dominated by some of the largest MRPs. MRP S2 is situated on
7286 | www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1401657111

the solvent side of the SSU and carries both NTE and CTE; it is
located so that it connects components of all three major structural domains, i.e., the head, body, and platform of the SSU (Fig.
1D). ecS2 interacts with h35 and h40 of the bacterial rRNA
(Fig. S6B). However, the helix-turn-helix motif that interacts
with h40 is absent in MRP S2, as is h40 in the mito-12S rRNA
(Figs. S2D and S6B), thus presenting an excellent example of the
complementary loss of interacting RNA–protein partners in the
mito-SSU during the course of evolution.
MRPs S10, S14, and S24 form a central cluster in the head of
the mito-SSU (Fig. 4), above the mRNA entrance. MRP S24, as
a distant ortholog of bacterial S3 (22), shows a structural similarity to the N-terminal domain of ecS3 and fits nicely into the
corresponding density. Even though no MRP cryo-EM mass
compensates for the lost C-terminal domain of ecS3, its interacting bacterial rRNA helices are conserved in the mito-SSU.
MRP S24 is surrounded by MRPs S10, S14, and the density
tentatively assigned to mito-specific MRP S39. Although the
overall positions of MRPs S10, S14, and S24 are similar to those
in the bacterial ribosome, the mito-specific NTE and CTE of
MRP S10 and the NTE of MRP S14 are oriented on the solvent
side. The CTE of MRP S10 and NTE of MRP S14 are oriented
so that they both potentially might interact with MRP S24 (Fig.
4). The density assigned to MRP S39 spans the mito-SSU head,
appearing on both the solvent and interface sides, covers MRP
S10 and its mito-specific CTE on the solvent side (Fig. 1 C and
D), and contributes in a major way to the formation of the
mRNA gate that covers the entrance of the mRNA channel (4).
MRP S39 is required for mitochondrial translation (16) and
cross-links to mitochondrial translation initiation factor 3 (23),
further supporting the strategic location of this largest of SSU
MRPs close to the interface between the head and body regions.
MRP S7 (Figs. 1 C and D and 5C) is located on the mRNA
path of the SSU head, near what would be the bacterial tRNAexit site (E site). MRP S7 has a 43-aa NTE and a 21-aa insertion
in the middle (Table S1). Its NTE forms an α-helical structure
that occupies a position similar to that of protein yS28 in the
yeast 40S ribosome (Fig. S6C) (24), and its mito-specific insertion interacts mainly with the density assigned to mito-specific
MRP S35, right above MRP S7. MRP S9 carries the longest
mito-specific NTE of ∼200 aa residues (Table S1). Its C terminus, which spans the SSU’s mRNA decoding center (25), is
highly conserved. The NTE covers most of the solvent side of the
homologous domain of MRP S9 and would interact with the
density assigned to mito-specific MRP S35 on the upper side and
with h38 and h43 on the lower side. Additional interactions of
mito-specific MRPs with mito-specific extensions of MRPs S7
and S9 are described in SI Results and Discussion.
SSU Platform. The central domain of the 12S rRNA (Fig. S2) is
highly conserved, except for h26 and h21 (Fig. S2E). H21 in the

bacterial SSU originates from the platform and spans the solvent
side of the SSU body. MRPs on the platform, i.e., S6, S11, S18,
and S21, are also conserved (Fig. 1), with MRPs S11, S18, and
S21 carrying mito-specific extensions (Table S1). Three isoforms
of MRP S18 (S18A, S18B, and S18C), which vary in size (143–
258 aa), are present in the mammalian mitoribosome (26, 27).
Both the NTE (22 aa) and CTE (60 aa) of the S18A isoform
could be modeled into the density in the immediate vicinity of
the conserved region of S18. The CTE of MRP S18A is located
on the solvent side near the conventional mRNA-exit region
(Fig. 5C) (28), and its NTE interacts primarily with h20 and h24.
These observations suggest that the bovine mito-SSU under
study here contained primarily the S18A isoform. MRP S11, also
situated near the mRNA-exit region, carries an NTE facing the
solvent side of the SSU that interacts with the CTE of MRP
S18A and the NTE of MRP S21 (Fig. 5C). Bacterial S21 is
known to be involved in the initiation of protein synthesis (29).
The C terminus of S21 is disordered in the crystallographic structure of the E. coli ribosome (30), and S21 is absent altogether in
the Thermus thermophilus ribosome (25). We have modeled the
full-length MRP S21 into the cryo-EM density, which supports
an α-helical structure for its C terminus (Fig. S1C). This region of
MRP S21 interacts with MRP S2 and with a density that has been
tentatively assigned to MRP S36 on the solvent side (Figs. 1D
and 5C). The NTE of MRP S21 makes significant contacts with
both conserved and mito-specific extensions of MRPs S11 and
S18A in the cleft region of the platform (Fig. 5C).

Interactions with the 39S LSU. To understand the interaction between the two mitoribosomal subunits, we docked the components

Topology of the mRNA Path. One of the unique features of the

mammalian mitochondrial translation is that only three of its 11
cistrons possess 5′ UTRs, and these are only a few nucleotides in
length. The remaining eight mRNAs do not have a 5′ UTR and
are basically leaderless (13). In the cryo-EM structure of the
mito-SSU, the mRNA entrance has a unique gate-like feature,
which is composed of mito-specific MRPs (4) (“mgt” in Figs. 1B
and 5 A and B) that may be involved in the recruitment of the
leaderless mito-mRNAs during translation initiation. In the
bacterial ribosome, proteins S3, S4, and S5 occupy the mRNA
entrance (28). Of these, the proteins homologous to S4 and the
C-terminal domain of S3 are absent in the mitoribosome.
However, only ecS4 is replaced by a mito-specific MRP. Thus,
the molecular landscape of the mRNA entrance in the mito-SSU
is significantly remodeled. It is composed of MRP S5 and four
other mito-specific MRPs (Fig. 5). Densities assigned to MRPs
S33 and S37 also encircle the mRNA entrance from the solvent
side, whereas the density tentatively assigned to MRP S22 joins

the mRNA entrance from the interface side of the mito-SSU
head. The NTE of MRP S5 interacts with the density assigned to
mito-specific MRP S39, which apparently constitutes the majority of the mRNA gate feature emerging from the SSU head
(Figs. 2A and 5 A and B).
At the mRNA-exit region, where the 5′ side of mRNA would
interact with the mito-SSU, all the rRNA helices are conserved
except for the anti–Shine–Dalgarno sequence, which is absent
(Fig. S2F). As mentioned above, homologs of all three mRNAexit region proteins— S11, S18, and S21—are present in the
mito-SSU, and each of these possesses mito-specific NTEs and
CTEs that have significantly altered the molecular landscape
of that region. Intriguingly, the CTE of the S18A would be close
to the 5′ end of the mRNA (Fig. 5C). Because the CTEs of the
three S18 isoforms vary significantly in size (18–89 aa), these
isoforms may constitute specialized mito-SSUs for the recruitment and translation of three mito-mRNAs that carry 5′-UTR
segments or for the overlapping ORFs that are present in the two
dicistronic mRNAs (13).

of the previously published mito-LSU models (6, 11) into the
LSU portion of the 55S mitoribosome map (Fig. 6A), as described in SI Materials and Methods. We identify 14 contact
points between the subunits (Fig. 6 B and C and Table S4). Locations of bridges B2a, B2b, B2c, B3, B5, and B7a are conserved
between the bacterial and mitochondrial ribosomes (31); however, the interacting components of some of these bridges appear
to be slightly altered (Table S4). Moreover, retention of several
RNA–RNA bridges suggests strong conservation of the functional core region of the mitoribosome. An unassigned MRP
density, present immediately next to the 12S rRNA helix 42
and apparently corresponds to the unmodeled C-terminal region of MRP S25 but readily segments with the mito-LSU, is
involved in formation of two bridges, B1a and B1b (4). Thus,
five bridges, B1a–d and B9, are formed exclusively by the mitospecific MRPs from both subunits. In summary, there are seven
RNA–RNA bridges, six protein–protein bridges, and one RNA–
protein bridge (Table S4). Clearly, as we previously suggested
(4), there is significantly greater participation by MRPs in
intersubunit communication in the mitoribosome than in the
bacterial ribosome, which contains only one protein–protein
bridge (31). Some of these MRPs compensate for the absence
of functionally relevant bridges in the bacterial ribosome involving rRNA segments (e.g., bacterial bridge B1a involving 23S
rRNA helix 38, which is absent in mito-16S rRNA and is compensated by a mito-specific MRP of the mito-LSU). The absence
of the previously identified bridge B7b (4) in the present map
could be attributed to dynamic nature of that bridge. Interestingly, none of the mito-specific extensions in homologous MRPs
participate in the intersubunit interaction.
In addition to illustrating the molecular topography of the
significantly altered mRNA-binding path, the mito-SSU structure presented here hints at a stepwise molecular evolution of
the mitoribosomal architecture starting with a conserved 12S
rRNA segment and 15 homologous MRPs. In subsequent steps,
NTE(s) and/or CTE(s) are added to these homologous MRPs to
aid the specific functional needs of the mitoribosome, such as the
recruitment of leaderless mRNAs. They also apparently fill in for
some of the lost peripheral bacterial rRNA segments and partially replace missing bacterial proteins, because many of the
extensions are present on the solvent side of the structure. A
subsequent recruitment of mito-specific MRPs, which interact
primarily with mito-specific extensions of homologous MRPs,
apparently was needed to stabilize the overall architecture further.
7288 | www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1401657111

As we described earlier, these mito-specific MRPs also contribute
to the formation of the mRNA entrance gate and intersubunit
bridges and appear to provide an additional layer protecting
the mitoribosome structure from the harsh chemical environment of the mitochondrial matrix.

Isolation and Purification of the Mitoribosome. The 55S mitoribosome and its
subunits were isolated and purified from the Bos taurus liver by following
the previously reported method (32) (see SI Materials and Methods for
details). For the cryo-EM studies, the 55S mitoribosome was obtained by
reassociating the purified 28S and 39S subunits. The two subunits were incubated in buffer containing 20 mM Hepes-KOH (pH 7.6), 20 mM MgCl2,
40 mM KCl, and 20 mM DTT at 37 °C for 30 min. The incubation mixture then
was subjected to 10–30% sucrose gradient centrifugation under the same
buffer conditions at 22,000 rpm using a Beckman SW32 rotor for 16 h. The
pooled reassociated 55S mitoribosome fractions were pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 42,000 rpm for 6 h in a Beckman type Ti70 rotor. The pellet
was suspended in the same buffer and stored in small aliquots at −80 °C.
Cryo-EM, Image Processing, and 3D Reconstruction. Cryo-EM grids were prepared according to standard procedures (33), by applying 4 μL of the 55S
mitoribosome suspension (32 nM) onto the Quantifoil Holey carbon copper
grid using Vitrobot (FEI). Data were collected on a 300-kV JEOL 3200 field
emission gun electron microscope with a magnification of 59,717×. Then 832
micrographs were scanned on a Zeiss flatbed scanner (Z/I Imaging) with
a step size of 7 μm, corresponding to 1.17 Å on the object scale and were
sorted into 48 defocus groups. A total of 866,553 particle images were
picked originally and were subjected to supervised classification (34) using
our previous 55S cryo-EM map (4) and the computationally separated 39S
(LSU) portion of the same map as two references and SPIDER (35). Of these
images, 428,129 classified with the 55S reference (Fig. S7A). Relion-based
unsupervised classification (36) estimated a conformational heterogeneity
within the images classified with the 55S reference (Fig. S7B). Based on
statistical information derived from the Relion classification, we removed
∼28% of the particles with low cross-correlation coefficient values with the
55S reference projections. The remaining 307,556 particle images were included in the final reconstruction. Projection-matching in conjunction with
small-angle alignment (up to 0.2° angular spacing) was used for the iterative
refinements using SPIDER (35). The resolution of the final contrast transfer
function-corrected 3D map, estimated using the Fourier shell correlation
with a cutoff value of 0.5, was 7.0 Å (Fig. S1).
Modeling of rRNA. To model the 12S rRNA, we primarily used the structural
constraints of the cryo-EM density obtained by applying a higher density
threshold to the entire mito-SSU map (Fig. S2B). We used the template 16S
rRNA structures (25, 30) to build the structurally homologous 12S rRNA
segments as described previously (37) and a knowledge-based approach to

Modeling of MRPs. MRPs were modeled into the cryo-EM density in multiple
steps as depicted in flow diagram (Fig. S3). First, we generated the iterative
threading assembly refinement (I-TASSER) (40) models for all 31 SSU MRPs.
Picking the best models for the conserved regions of the homologs of the 15
bacterial MRPs and their modeling into the cryo-EM density was relatively
straightforward and was performed using Situs (41) and Chimera (42)
(see SI Materials and Methods for details). The extensions and insertions
of homologous MRPs were modeled into densities present in the immediate
vicinity of their conserved domains using Coot (43) and Chimera. Fitted 12S
rRNA and homologous MRP models were combined and subjected to molecular dynamics flexible fitting (MDFF) (44).

the resolution of the map is somewhat lower (7–9 Å) than within the core of
the molecule. Therefore, to localize these MRPs, we took the following
approach (Fig. S3; also see SI Materials and Methods for details). We separated the remaining unmodeled cryo-EM density as an ensemble mass and
subjected it to Segger-based segmentation (14 and Fig. S4). To validate the
segmentation results for the mito-specific MRPs, we also applied Segger
tools to the complete protein density, including the homologous MRPs.
Results were highly reproducible and consistent for the homologous MRPs
(Fig. S4 C and F). Next, we determined the voxel volume and surface area for
each of the segmented densities and initially assigned the density to a mitospecific MRP based on its relative correlation with MRP’s molecular mass
(Table S2 and Fig. S4G). The final assignments were made after comparing
the shape of the each segmented density with that of an I-TASSER homology
model (Fig. S5). Independent assignment of the density for MRP S29 using
this method also matched the immuno-EM localization of this protein on the
mito-SSU (21). After the docking, we individually applied MDFF (44) for 100
ps for each mito-specific MRP; if there was an indication of melting of secondary structures, that model was not taken into account.

Segmentation and Placement of Mito-Specific MRPs. Densities for 16 mitospecific MRPs are distributed mostly at the map’s peripheral regions, where

build the single-stranded nonhomologous loop regions (see SI Materials and
Methods for details). Briefly, the database of known RNA structures was
searched to model the loop that was most consistent with the surrounding
RNA and with the cryo-EM density corresponding to the rRNA (Fig. S2). To
investigate the interaction between the loop and its surroundings, van der
Waals energies (Evdw) were calculated using the standard Lennard–Jones
6–12 potential and parameters of the AMBER force field (38). The candidate
loop structure that satisfies the end constraints (i.e., a small rmsd) with the
minimum Evdw and the structural constraints of the cryo-EM density was
selected. The final secondary structure (Fig. S2A) generally matched with the
predicted secondary structure of the 12S rRNA (39), except for helices 7 and
22 and penultimate helix 44.
