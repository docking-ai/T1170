SbtA is a high-affinity, sodium-dependent bicarbonate transporter
found in the cyanobacterial CO2-concentrating mechanism (CCM).
SbtA forms a complex with SbtB, while SbtB allosterically regulates
the transport activity of SbtA by binding with adenyl nucleotides.
The underlying mechanism of transport and regulation of SbtA is
largely unknown. In this study, we report the three-dimensional
structures of the cyanobacterial Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 SbtA–
SbtB complex in both the presence and absence of HCO3− and/or
AMP at 2.7 Å and 3.2 Å resolution. An analysis of the inward-facing
state of the SbtA structure reveals the HCO3−/Na+ binding site,
providing evidence for the functional unit as a trimer. A structural
comparison found that SbtA adopts an elevator mechanism for bicarbonate transport. A structure-based analysis revealed that the allosteric inhibition of SbtA by SbtB occurs mainly through the T-loop
of SbtB, which binds to both the core domain and the scaffold domain of SbtA and locks it in an inward-facing state. T-loop conformation is stabilized by the AMP molecules binding at the SbtB trimer
interfaces and may be adjusted by other adenyl nucleotides. The
unique regulatory mechanism of SbtA by SbtB makes it important
to study inorganic carbon uptake systems in CCM, which can be used
to modify photosynthesis in crops.

yanobacteria have evolved a unique CO2-concentrating mechanism (CCM) in carbon fixation. This increases the intracellular
concentration of CO2 feeding ribulose bisphosphate carboxylaseoxygenase (RuBisCO) that is encapsulated in carboxysomes, improving photosynthetic performance (1, 2). The CCM contains five
distinct uptake systems that transport dissolved inorganic carbon
(Ci), HCO3−, and CO2 into the cell (3). Among them, SbtA and
BicA are sodium-dependent HCO3− transporters with high affinity
and medium affinity, respectively (4, 5). BCT1, or CmpABCD, is a
HCO3− transporter complex powered by ATP hydrolysis (6), while
NDH-I3 and NDH-I4 complexes are responsible for CO2 uptake
(7, 8). These Ci uptake systems are ideal targets for enhancing
photosynthesis in C3 plants (9–14).
Ci uptake systems are regulated at different levels to adapt to
a changing environment. CmpABCD was first identified as a cyanobacterial Ci transporter whose expression level is induced by Ci
limitation (6), as are SbtA and NDH-I3, which are regulated by the
LysR-type transcription factor NdhR (15). The molecular mechanism
underlying transcriptional regulation has previously been studied (16).
As a transcription repressor, NdhR controls the expression levels
of ndh-I3, BicA, and SbtA/B, while the Ci limitation metabolite
2-phosphoglycerate can bind to NdhR to alter its conformation
and release repression.
Ci transporter activity is allosterically or posttranslationally regulated. SbtA forms a complex with SbtB, while SbtB regulates the
transport of SbtA via binding with AMP or cAMP (17). The active
form of BicA is a dimer stabilized by the C-terminal sulfate transporter and anti-sigma factor antagonist (STAS) domain; however,
PNAS 2021 Vol. 118 No. 22 e2101632118

this activity could not be reconstructed in a heterologous expression system (18, 19). This suggests that transporter activity could
require additional regulatory proteins or posttranslational modification. In addition, it is considered that the CmpABCD transporter
activity is regulated by the cytoplasmic HCO3− concentration since
the CmpC subunit contains an extra substrate-binding domain in
addition to the nucleotide-binding domain (3). The molecular
mechanisms of transport and activity regulation of Ci transporters
remain largely unknown, which, to a large extent, limits their application in photosynthesis improvement (20–22).
This study focuses on the structural and mechanistic analysis
of the bicarbonate transporter SbtA by determining its complex
structure with the regulatory subunit SbtB, both in the presence
and absence of HCO3− and/or AMP. A structure-based analysis
suggests molecular mechanisms underlying transport and regulation.
Results
SbtA Activity and Allosteric Inhibition by SbtB. Can encodes the
carbonic anhydrase, which is required for the growth of Escherichia
coli under normal air conditions; a can paralog, cynT, can replace
can for normal growth when induced with azide (23). This finding
was used successfully for active bicarbonate transporter screening
(24). We generated the can knockout strain using E. coli C43(DE3)
[C43(DE3)-Δcan], which was used to characterize the activity of
Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 SbtA, SbtA–SbtB, and its derivative

Significance
SbtA is a sodium-dependent, high-affinity bicarbonate transporter in the cyanobacterial CO2-concentrating mechanism (CCM).
The transport activity of SbtA is regulated by SbtB, which is additionally influenced by adenyl nucleotides. We determined the
three-dimensional structures of SbtA in complex with SbtB in two
different conformations: A model summarizing the molecular
mechanism of transport and allosteric inhibition of SbtA was
established based on structural and biochemical data. The transport and regulatory mechanism revealed by our study represents
a valuable case to investigate allosteric regulation of membrane
transporters and, more importantly, will benefit plant photosynthesis improvement using the CCM system.

mutations. Consistent with previous results, the C43(DE3)-Δcan
strain cannot grow under normal air conditions but can grow in
the presence of 1 mM azide (SI Appendix, Fig. S1). The transfer of
the SbtA gene into C43(DE3)-Δcan partially complements growth
failure under normal air conditions, but the cotransfer of SbtA
and SbtB genes fails to do so (Fig. 1 A and B). This suggests that
Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 SbtA alone possesses bicarbonate
transporter activity when it is expressed in E. coli C43(DE3),
while SbtB allosterically inhibits transporter activity, which is
consistent with previous studies (24).
Overall Structure of SbtA in Complex with SbtB. To obtain SbtA and
SbtB protein complex for structural analysis, we coexpressed the
Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803–originated SbtA and SbtB in E. coli
C43 (DE3). We found that the addition of 2 mM AMP or ADP but
not cAMP or ATP in the purification buffer was necessary for a
stable 1:1 molar ratio complex formation (Fig. 2A). This is consistent with previous results suggesting that the membrane association of SbtB depends on the presence of AMP/ADP but not on
cAMP (17). The purified SbtA–SbtB complex protein sample was
used for both cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and crystallization analysis. The cryo-EM structure of SbtA–SbtB complex was
obtained in lipid nanodiscs at 2.7 Å resolution (SbtABEM) (Fig. 2 B
and C and SI Appendix, Fig. S2 and Table S1). The map quality
was high, and numerous additional densities around SbtA were
assigned as annular membrane lipids (SI Appendix, Fig. S3), allowing
us to build an accurate model. The resulting model was then used as
a template to determine the crystal structure by molecular replacement, resulting in the 3.2 Å resolution crystal structure of
the SbtA–SbtB complex (SbtABXtal) (Fig. 2D and SI Appendix,
Table S2). The overall structures of SbtABEM and SbtABXtal are
similar, which form a three-fold complex with a rmsd of 0.635 Å

over 1,178 Cα atoms. SbtA and SbtB form homotrimers in the
membrane and cytoplasm, respectively, and each SbtB protomer
binds to the cytoplasmic surface of a SbtA protomer to form a
heterodimer (Fig. 2 B–D). Similar trimeric transporter structures
have been reported in the bacteria ammonium transporter AmtB
(25, 26), the glutamate transporter homolog Gltph (27), the
human excitatory amino acid transporter EAAT1 (28), and the
human concentrative nucleoside transporter CNT3 (29), suggesting that the trimer is the functional unit of SbtA as proposed
in other studies (24).
The SbtA molecule in both SbtABEM and SbtABXtal structures
is composed of 10 transmembrane helices (TMs). Of these, TMs
1, 4, 6, and 9 are interrupted by short loops (Fig. 2 C and E). The
long loop connecting TM5 and TM6 (residues 165 to 207 in
SbtABEM and residues 170 to 207 in SbtABXtal), which may be
involved in activity regulation (30), is missing in both structures.
Both the N and C termini face the periplasm, which confirms the
previous experimental results (30). SbtA contains a scaffold domain,
consisting of TMs 1 to 2 and 6 to 7, that mediates the interactions
between SbtA molecules formed along the trimer. It also contains a
core domain consisting of TMs 3 to 5 and 8 to 10 (Fig. 2 C, E,
and F). A narrow cleft is present between two domains (Fig. 2F).
The SbtB structure is a typical PII fold, characterized by a four
antiparallel–stranded β-sheet inserted by two helices, and the long
loop comprising residues 40 to 58 (previously named T-loop) is
inserted between β2 and β3 (Fig. 2C).
SbtA in both the SbtABEM and SbtABXtal structures is positioned in an inward-facing state. However, the HCO3− substrate
is clearly defined in each SbtA molecule of the SbtABXtal structure
but not in the SbtABEM structure. Three AMP molecules are well
defined in the SbtB trimer interfaces of the SbtABEM structure but
are disordered in the SbtABXtal structure. Accordingly, the T-loop
in the SbtB structure is well defined in the SbtABEM structure but
disordered in the SbtABXtal structure (Fig. 2 C and D). Metal ion
binding sites, which are supposed to be sodium, are observed in
both the SbtABEM and SbtABXtal structures (Fig. 3F and SI Appendix, Fig. S4 A and B).

substrate HCO3− binding site is located at the interface of the core
domain and the scaffold domain (Fig. 3A). Two discontinuous
TMs, TM4a/4b and TM9a/9b, are surrounded by other TMs and
form a TM cross. HCO3− binds to the pericentral side of the cross
(Fig. 3 A and B and SI Appendix, Fig. S4C). The HCO3− binding
site is accessible from the cytoplasm through a cavity composed of
the TMs 2, 6a, 7, and 9b (Fig. 3A). The side chains of residues
Ser114 and Ser116 from TM4b and Asp325 and Ser327 from
TM9b form hydrogen bonds with HCO3− either directly or through
a water molecule; the main chain oxygen of Ser324 and two water
molecules form hydrogen bonds with HCO3− (Fig. 3C). Notably,
residues Ser116, Asp325, and Ser327 are subjected to conformational changes in the SbtA molecule of the SbtABEM structure,
which may distort the binding of HCO3− (Fig. 3D and SI Appendix,
Fig. S4 C and D). The mutation of the HCO3− binding residue
could significantly impair the complementary function of SbtA
(Fig. 3E and SI Appendix, Fig. S5). On the peripheral side of the
TM cross, there was a clear electron density peak that was supposed
to be an Na+ binding site (Fig. 3B and SI Appendix, Fig. S4 A and B);
it forms five bonds [usually seen in sodium-dependent transporters
(19, 31)] with the main chain oxygens of residues Phe110, Gly111,
and Ala112 from TM4a and Ala-320 and Ser322 from TM9a
(Fig. 3F). Most of the residues involved in HCO3− and Na+ binding
are conserved among cyanobacterial SbtA proteins (SI Appendix,
Fig. S6), suggesting a conserved binding mode. In summary, the
SbtA structures captured in SbtABEM and SbtABXtal complexes
represent substrate-free and substrate-binding conformations of
the inward-facing state, respectively.

Interactions between SbtA and SbtB and Functional Role of AMP.

While SbtA and SbtB form similar heterodimers in the SbtABEM
and SbtABXtal structures, the interaction surfaces are significantly different. In the SbtABEM structure, the interaction surface of SbtA and SbtB is clearly defined and buries about 807.4
Å2 (Fig. 4A); it is constituted by the β1-α1 loop, the α2-β4 loop,
and the T-loop from SbtB as well as TM2, 7, 9b, and 10 from SbtA.
The T-loop of SbtB inserts itself into the cytoplasmic cavity of SbtA
constituted by TMs 2, 6a, 7, and 9b, and the interactions are primarily van der Waals’ contacts (Fig. 4A). Additionally, hydrogenbonding interactions are found between the side chains of residues
Glu265, Ser268, Arg269, and Arg333 from SbtA and the side
chains of residues Glu13, Asn52, and Tyr87, the backbones of residues Arg46, Thr53, and Asp86 from SbtB (Fig. 4 B and C). However, in the SbtABXtal structure, the T-loop of SbtB is disordered and
the interactions between SbtB and SbtA are restricted to the β1-α1/
α2-β4 loops and TM9b, while the interaction surface area is reduced
to 127.6 Å2 (SI Appendix, Fig. S7A).
We analyzed the determinants stabilizing the SbtB T-loop
conformation in the SbtABEM structure and found that the
AMP molecule bound in SbtB plays a critical role (Fig. 4A). The
AMP binds at the intermolecular cleft of two neighboring SbtB
molecules (Fig. 4D and SI Appendix, Fig. S8), which is similar to
the previous SbtB trimeric structure (17, 32). However, a detailed
analysis revealed more extensive hydrogen bonds surrounding AMP
in our structure (Fig. 4D). In particular, the residues Ser42 and
Arg43 from the T-loop and the residue Gly89 from the b4 form four
hydrogen bonds with the phosphate group of AMP. Additionally,
the guanidine group of Arg43 forms a hydrogen bond with the main
chain oxygen of residue Asp86 from the α2-β4 loop; Arg46 forms
hydrogen bonds with the Arg43 main chain oxygen and Asn59.

These interactions dictate and stabilize the T-loop conformation
of SbtB when binding with SbtA.
We identified key residues involved in SbtA–SbtB interactions
and AMP binding to perform mutation-based functional analyses. Pull-down results show that the mutant SbtA(R333A)-SbtB
almost abolishes the SbtA–SbtB complex formation, while SbtASbtB(E13D) impairs complex formation (Fig. 4E). Point mutations
aiming to reduce the SbtB T-loop interactions with SbtA, such as
SbtA(R269A)-SbtB, SbtA(E265A)-SbtB, and SbtA-SbtB(V45L),
have relatively minor effects on complex formation, which may
be due to their extensive interaction surface areas. However,
SbtA-SbtB(S47Q) mutation aiming to introduce steric confliction at the interaction surface disrupts the complex formation (SI
Appendix, Fig. S7B). Furthermore, mutations of residues involving
AMP binding, SbtA-SbtB(S42A/R43A) and SbtA-SbtB(R46A),
significantly reduce the complex formation (Fig. 4E). Accordingly, mutations that abolish the complex formation, such as
SbtA-SbtB(S47Q) and SbtA(R333A)-SbtB, could significantly
reduce the growth failure of C43(DE3)-Δcan-SbtAB, while mutations
that impair the complex formation, such as SbtA-SbtB(E13D), SbtASbtB(S42A/R43A), SbtA-SbtB(R46A), and SbtA(E269A)-SbtB, have
a positive effect on the growth (Fig. 4F and SI Appendix, Fig. S9).
Therefore, we conclude that the inhibition of SbtA activity by
SbtB relies on the SbtA–SbtB complex formation, which is greatly
strengthened by AMP binding, as is also proposed in other work
(17, 24).
These results provide a molecular explanation for why the addition of AMP during the protein purification greatly enhances the
complex formation of SbtA–SbtB (Fig. 2A), and they also explain
well why the association of SbtB with the membrane largely
depends on the presence of AMP (17). To investigate why the
addition of cAMP impairs the SbtA–SbtB complex formation,

we superimposed the cAMP molecule to the AMP binding site of
the SbtABEM structure (Fig. 4G). Our results suggest that the
binding mode of the adenine moiety of cAMP overlaps with AMP,
while the hydrogen bonds formed via residues Ser42 and Arg43 may
be lost in the presence of cAMP. Additionally, cAMP displays a
steric clash with the sidechain of Arg46. These processes could distort the T-loop conformation and diminish SbtA–SbtB interactions.
Transport and Regulatory Mechanism. The TM cross is a typical
structural feature of the substrate-binding site in the SbtA protein
(Fig. 3B) and resembles the structure of some solute carrier (SLC)
family transporters. A protein structure comparison via DALI
server (33) produced four matches (z-score over 10), all of which
were sodium-dependent SLC family transporters [NhaA, NhaP,
NapA, and ASBT; respective corresponding Protein Data Bank
(PDB) accession codes 4atv, 4cz8, 4bwz, and 3zux (34–37)]. These
not only share a similar structure feature at the substrate-binding
site but also similar overall topology (Fig. 5A). Of particular interest is the ASBTNM, which is a bacterial homolog (Neisseria
meningitidis) of the animal sodium-dependent bile acid symporter
ASBT (34). While SbtA and ASBTNM only share ∼10% sequence
identity, both structures contain 10 TMs, and over 80% of their
structural elements were aligned. All structures of these transporters contain two domains: a core domain for substrate binding and a scaffold domain for oligomerization. The transport
mechanism of these transporters has been proposed based on

their structures (34–38), which could take the form of a rocking
bundle or elevator mechanism involving rigid body movement of
the core domain between inward-facing and outward-facing states.
SbtA could follow a similar transport mechanism (Fig. 5B), and the
core domain may undergo rigid movement to translocate HCO3−
into the plasma membrane.
Current and previous results both demonstrate that SbtB can
inhibit the bicarbonate transporter activity of SbtA when heterologously expressed in E. coli (24) (Fig. 1 A and B), suggesting
that SbtB allosterically inhibits the transport activity of SbtA by
forming complexes under certain physiological conditions. An
analysis of our structural data reveals the underlying molecular
mechanism of the allosteric inhibition of SbtA by SbtB. In the
SbtABEM structure, the SbtA–SbtB interaction surface involves
both the core domain and the scaffold domain of SbtA; in particular, the T-loop of SbtB inserts itself into the cytoplasmic cavity
formed between the two domains of SbtA. This could preclude the
core domain movement during transport and lock the SbtA at the
inward-facing substrate-free conformation (Fig. 5B). However, in
the SbtABXtal structure, the intermolecular interactions are restricted to the core domain of SbtA due to the disordered T-loop
or the absence of AMP in the SbtB molecule (Fig. 5B), and the
SbtA protein is located in the inward-facing substrate-binding
conformation. This implies that the SbtABXtal structure could
represent a prestep of allosteric inhibition. Therefore, we conclude that high AMP concentrations stabilize the SbtB T-loop

conformation and help insert it into the cytoplasmic cavity of
SbtA, which locks the conformation of the scaffold domain and
core domain of SbtA in the inward-facing state and inhibits bicarbonate transporter activity. Additionally, the presence of cAMP
can compete with AMP to bind with SbtB, inducing conformational change in the T-loop and precluding its interaction with
SbtA, relieving SbtB inhibition toward SbtA. Therefore, the T-loop
of SbtB could regulate the transporter engine SbtA in response to
environmental AMP or cAMP concentration.
Discussion
The mechanism of allosteric regulation of SbtA by SbtB is similar
to the regulation of the ammonium transporter AmtB by GlnK in
bacteria, where GlnK also forms a trimer with ADP molecules
binding at the neighboring dimeric interface to allosterically inhibit
the transporter activity of AmtB (39). Both SbtB and GlnK belong
to the PII family of proteins, which help regulate various aspects of
nitrogen assimilation and carbon homeostasis via binding with
adenyl nucleotides (21). This regulation mechanism is found in
many different species despite long-term evolution.
Cyanobacterial CCM contains three bicarbonate transporters.
Of these, SbtA can be allosterically inhibited by SbtB. The inhibitory

effect relies on the StbA and SbtB complex formation and is
adjusted by the adenyl nucleotides binding with SbtB. The presence
of AMP stabilizes the SbtA–SbtB complex, while cAMP disrupts
the complex (Fig. 2A), as is also shown in other studies (17). The
T-loop of SbtB could be involved in the interaction between SbtA
and SbtB but is disorganized in structures where SbtB is associated
with AMP, ADP, or cAMP (17, 32). Therefore, the structure of
how SbtA–SbtB complexes bind with AMP explains the inhibitory
mechanism of SbtA by SbtB. A recently reported Ca2+-ATP:SbtB
structure from Cyanobium sp. 7001 revealed that Ca2+ could
stabilize the T-loop conformation, which is required for allosteric
regulation of SbtA (32). However, additional structural analysis
demonstrates that the T-loop conformation in Ca2+-ATP:SbtB
structure is different from the structure we outlined and conflicts
with SbtA when aligned to the SbtABEM structure (SI Appendix,
Fig. S10). These results are consistent with our biochemical data,
which demonstrates that the presence of ATP decreases the
SbtA–SbtB complex formation (Fig. 2A). The SbtA–SbtB complex was also destabilized by cAMP both in vivo and in vitro, and
cAMP was considered a physiologically high carbon signal (21).
This seems to be in conflict with the notion that Ci transporter
activity can be activated at low carbon levels and inhibited at high

Fig. 5. Transport and regulatory mechanism of SbtA. (A) Structure comparison of SbtA with topological homologs. Protomers of SbtA, NhaA, NhaP, NapA,
and ASBT are displayed in intracellular view. The scaffold domain and core domain are colored by slate blue and light blue, respectively. (B) Proposed
transport and regulatory mechanism of SbtA. Distinct conformations are indicated. The top illustrates key conformational states of SbtA during the transport
of substrate. In the outward state, the TM cross is exposed to the periplasm, and Na+-binding may facilitate the binding of substrate. Converting to the inward
state, the core domain undergoes rigid movement in order to translocate HCO3− into the plasma membrane. The bottom illustrates the allosteric inhibition of
SbtA by SbtB. In the presence of AMP, T-loop of SbtB inserts into the cytoplasmic cavity formed between the two domains of SbtA, which locks SbtA at an
inward substrate-free state and inhibits the bicarbonate transporter activity.

carbon levels; however, it could accommodate specific physiological environmental transitions (24, 32). The unique regulatory
mechanism of SbtA by SbtB makes it important to investigate Ci
uptake systems, which could facilitate the photosynthetic modification of CCM in crops (40).
Materials and Methods
Gene Cloning and Protein Purification. The genes encoding SbtA and SbtB
were amplified by PCR from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 genomic DNA. The
fragment SbtA and SbtB were digested with NcoI/SalI and NdeI/XhoI, respectively, and were subsequently ligated into the MCS1 and MCS2 of
pRSFDuet plasmid, respectively. The recombinant plasmid pRSFDuet-SbtASbtB, including a C-terminal His-tag on SbtA, was used to transform E. coli
C43(DE3) for expression. Bacterial cells were grown at 37 °C in Luria broth
(LB) medium with 50 μg/mL kanamycin, and protein expression was induced
by 0.25 mM β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at around optical density
(OD)600 = 1.2.
After 14 h at 37 °C, the cells were collected and homogenized in buffer A
(100 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 5% [vol/vol] glycerol, and 2 mM AMP)
and lysed using a French press. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation.
The supernatant was collected and centrifuged using ultracentrifugation at
150,000 × g for 1 h. The membrane fraction was incubated with 1% (wt/vol)
n-dodecyl-β-d-maltopyranoside (DDM; Bluepus) for 2 h at 4 °C. After another centrifugation step at 20,000 × g for 45 min, the supernatant was
loaded onto an Ni2+-NTA affinity column (Qiagen) and then washed with
buffer B (100 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.018% DDM, and 2 mM
AMP) supplemented with 25 mM imidazole. The protein was eluted from
the column using buffer B supplemented with 250 mM imidazole and was
then concentrated to around 10 mg/mL before further purification by gel

filtration (Superdex-200) in buffer C (100 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl,
pH 8.0, 0.18% n-decyl-β-d-maltoside [DM; Anatrace], and 2 mM AMP).
The peak fraction was collected and concentrated to ∼5 mg/mL for
crystallization.
Construction of can Deletion Mutant. The can deletion in the chromosome of
E. coli was constructed. The upstream and downstream fragments of can
operon were amplified and overlapped together by PCR, resulting in the
replacement fragment Overlap-can. The sgRNA plasmid targeting gene can
pCB003_N20_can was obtained from pCB003 by PCR. The plasmid pCB006
was transformed into E. coli C43(DE3). Arabinose was added to the culture
when preparing the E. coli/pCB006 competent cell for recombination. A total
of 4 μL Overlap-can and 4 μL pCB003_N20_can were electroporated into the
E. coli/pCB006 competent cells. Cells were recovered at 30 °C for 2 h and then
spread onto LB agar plates containing kanamycin and spectinomycin and
incubated at 30 °C for 24 h. The right colonies were confirmed by DNA sequencing. pCB003 was cured by adding IPTG, and pCB006 was cured by
growing at 37 °C overnight.
Growth Assay. C43(DE3) and C43(DE3)-Δcan strains were first grown on LB
medium supplemented with 50 μg/mL kanamycin and 0.1 mM sodium azide at
37 °C overnight. Seed cells were prepared in LB medium to OD600 of 0.1. A total
of 1 mL seed cells was added to 20 mL LB medium containing 0.2 mM IPTG and
50 μg/mL kanamycin. Growth was measured at different time slots. For dilution
spotting assay, seed cells were diluted by 101-, 102-, 103-, 104-, and 105-fold,
respectively. A total of 2 μL aliquot of each dilution was spotted onto the LB
agar plate containing 0.2 mM IPTG and 50 μg/mL kanamycin. Plates were incubated at 37 °C overnight. All tests were repeated at least three times
independently.

Nanodisc Reconstitution. 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol
(POPG; Avanti) was solubilized in chloroform, dried under argon gas to form
a thin lipid film, and stored under vacuum overnight. The lipid film was
hydrated and resuspended at a concentration of 10 mM in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, and 100 mM sodium cholate.
SbtA–SbtB complex proteins, MSP2N2 membrane scaffold protein, and POPG
were mixed at a molar ratio of 1:3:150 in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris, pH
8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 15 mM sodium cholate, and 2 mM AMP and incubated at
4 °C for 1 h. Extra DDM detergent was removed by incubation with 0.6 mg/mL
Bio-Beads SM2 (Bio-Rad) at 4 °C overnight. Nanodisc-embedded SbtA–SbtB
was purified using a Superdex 200 column in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris,
pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, and 2 mM AMP.
Cryo-EM Sample Preparation and Data Acquisition. To prepare samples for cryoEM analysis, 3 μL purified nanodisc-embedded SbtA–SbtB complex at a concentration of 1 mg/mL was applied to glow discharged carbon grids (Quantifoil
Cu R1.2/1.3). Grids were blotted for 3 s and plunge-frozen in liquid ethane
cooled by liquid nitrogen using a Vitrobot Mark IV (Thermo Fisher) at 8 °C and
100% humidity. The prepared grids were transferred to a Titan Krios electron
microscopy operating at 300 kV equipped with Gatan K3 detector and GIF
Quantum energy filter. The movie stacks were recorded in the superresolution
mode at nominal magnification of 81,000× with a calibrated pixel size of
0.539 Å. The defocus range was from −1.8 to −1.5 μm. Each stack of 32 frames
was exposed for 2.56 s with a total dose rate of ∼50 e−/Å2. AutoEMation was
used for automated data collection (41). All 32 frames in each stack were
aligned using MotionCor2 (42) and binned to a pixel size of 1.0773 Å. The
defocus value of each image was determined by Gctf (43).

The overall resolutions were estimated based on the gold-standard Fourier shell
correlation = 0.143 criterion. The details related to data processing are summarized in SI Appendix, Fig. S2 and Table S1.
Model Building and Structure Refinement. The atomic coordinate of SbtAB
complex was generated by combining homology modeling and de novo
model building. The initial structure model of SbtA was predicted by protein
structure prediction server trRosetta (45), and the crystal structure of SbtB
(17) (PDB code 5O3S) was used. The structure of SbtAB complex was docked
into the density map and manually adjusted and rebuilt by COOT (46). The
resulting model was refined by phenix.real_space_refine program in PHENIX
(47) with secondary structure and geometry restraints. The structure was
validated with MolProbity (48), and refinement statistics are shown in SI
Appendix, Table S1. All structure figures were prepared in ChimeraX (49).
Crystallization, Data Collection, and Determination of Structure. SbtA–SbtB
complex was concentrated to 5 mg/mL and crystallized via vapor diffusion at
20 °C in 96-well sitting-drop plates. The best crystals were grown in 0.05 M
magnesium chloride, 0.1 M glycine pH 9.0, and 22% polyethylene glycol 400
(the protein:reservoir volume in a ratio of 1:1) and were directly flash-frozen
in liquid nitrogen for data collection. All data were collected at BL19U1
beamline of the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility under 100 K liquid
nitrogen stream (wavelength = 0.9798 Å) and processed using HKL-3000
(50). The SbtA–SbtB complex crystallized in space group H32 with cell parameters a = 107.2 Å, b = 107.2 Å, and c = 352.2 Å.
The complex structure was solved by molecular replacement with PHENIX,
using the SbtABEM structure (PDB code 7EGK) as an initial model. The model
was manually built in COOT, refined with PHENIX, and validated using
MolProbity. A summary of data collection and refinement statistics is provided in SI Appendix, Table S2.
Data Availability. The atomic coordinates of SbtABXtal have been deposited
in PDB with accession code 7EGL. The cryo-EM map and atomic coordinates
of SbtABEM have been deposited in the Electron Microscopy Data Bank
(EMD-31135) and PDB (7EGK). All other study data are included in the article
and/or SI Appendix.

Data Processing. A total of 3,186,493 particles were automatically picked using
RELION 3.0 (44) from 2,971 micrographs. After two rounds of two-dimensional
classification, ∼20% of the selected particles were used to generate an initial
model by RELION 3.0. With particles rescaled to 128 pixels, one good reference
and three bad references were generated after three-dimensional (3D) classifications. The good class from the last four iterations yielded a dataset containing 268,921 particles, giving rise to reconstruction at 3.4 Å resolution with
C3 symmetry applied. The dataset was then subjected to local search multireference 3D classification, and the multireference models were generated
using the reconstruction low-pass filtered to 5 to 30 Å. Particles from good
classes were merged and duplicated particles were removed, and another
round of multireference classification using bin1 particles yielded a dataset
containing 125,998 particles, resulting in reconstruction at 3.1 Å. The application of a solvent mask for further postprocessing improved resolution to 2.7 Å.
