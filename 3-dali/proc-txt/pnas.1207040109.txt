ATPase ∣ chaperone ∣ Hsp100 ∣ protein unfoldase

C

lpB is an ATP-dependent protein-remodeling machine that
has the remarkable ability to rescue stress-damaged proteins
from a previously aggregated state. As the major protein disaggregase in cells, bacterial ClpB and its yeast (Hsp104) and plant
(Hsp101) homologs are essential for thermotolerance development (1–3), and for cell survival from acute stress conditions (4).
At the molecular level, ClpB is a multidomain protein composed of two tandem Walker-type ATP-binding domains (AAA+
domains), termed D1 and D2, which drive ClpB’s chaperone activity. The D1 domain features the ClpB-specific M-domain, which
forms a long coiled-coil (5) and is essential for protein disaggregation (6, 7). Like other type II AAA+ ATPases, ClpB forms a double-ring structure, with six copies of the D1 and D2 domains each
making up a homohexamer ring (5, 8). Although ClpB shares
similar quaternary structure with ClpA (9), ClpC (10), and the single-ring ClpX (11) and HslU (12, 13) AAA+ ATPases, which function as the protein unfoldase components of energy-dependent
proteases, ClpB does not associate with a chambered peptidase
to degrade proteins. Instead, ClpB cooperates with the cognate
Hsp70 system (DnaKJ/GrpE) in a species-specific manner (14, 15)
to recover functional protein from aggregates (16–18).
The prevailing model suggests that DnaKJ/GrpE targets the
ClpB motor activity to aggregates (19, 20), which is consistent
with an upstream role of the DnaK system in protein disaggregation (21–23). Once targeted, ClpB disaggregates protein aggregates by extracting unfolded polypeptides (24) and threading
them through the ClpB hexamer ring (21, 25). In support of a
direct ClpB–DnaKJ/GrpE interaction, it was reported that ClpB
interacts with DnaK via the ClpB M-domain (15, 26). Notably,
replacing the M-domain of bacterial ClpB with that of its yeast
homolog Hsp104 switched the species specificity of the bichaperone system so that ClpB now cooperated with the eukaryotic
Hsp70/40 system and vice versa (7, 27). The role of the M-domain
in mediating DnaKJ/GrpE interaction is consistent with the
M-domain being on the outside of the ClpB hexamer (5, 8), but

incompatible with the previously proposed structure of yeast
Hsp104 (28, 29), which placed the M-domains on the interior or
intercalated between subunits.
Although we recently showed that ClpB and Hsp104 share a
similar 3D structure (30), functional differences exist (19, 31–33).
Moreover, it remains unclear how ClpB exerts the ATP power
stroke to thread substrates through the ClpB hexamer ring, and
how ClpB unfolds substrates that are typically much larger than
the ClpB hexamer itself. The latter might involve ClpB deoligomerization of a substrate-bound chaperone complex (15, 25, 34),
or perhaps other mechanical activities that remodel aggregates
prior to substrate translocation (5, 35).
Here, we combine structural and biochemical studies to provide
mechanistic insights into the functional role of ClpB in protein
disaggregation. Notably, we demonstrate using a disulfide crosslinked ClpB variant that deoligomerization of the ClpB hexamer
is not required for protein disaggregation. Furthermore, we found
that the active conformation of the D2 substrate-translocating
pore loop is controlled in cis by the nucleotide state of the same
D2 domain, and demonstrate the existence of a conserved but
structurally distinct intersubunit-signaling pathway found in diverse AAA+ ATPases. Our findings suggest that AAA+ machines
may utilize a common mechanism to harness the energy of ATP
binding and hydrolysis to fuel their diverse biological activities.

Crystal Structure of the ClpB D2 Domain. To visualize the structural

basis for the ATP-driven power stroke, we crystallized the isolated
D2 domain (residues 542–854) of Thermus thermophilus ClpB
(Fig. S1), featuring an E668A mutation in the Walker B motif.
This Walker B mutant can bind nucleotide and, when combined
with the analogous E271A mutation in the Walker B motif of the
D1 domain, renders ClpB ATP-hydrolysis deficient (8, 36). Three
different crystal forms were obtained in the presence or absence
of nucleotide, representing a total of seven independent structures of the D2 domain (Fig. 1A and Fig. S2A and Table S1). Notably, crystals obtained in the presence of nucleotide diffracted
consistently to higher resolution, but were merohedrally twinned

mutations (I683M, L706M, and L770M). Fortuitously, in addition to twinned crystals, this D2 variant also produced a new, untwinned crystal form (form II) in the same drop, which was used
for structure determination by molecular replacement. Although

ClpB is a ring-forming, ATP-dependent protein disaggregase that
cooperates with the cognate Hsp70 system to recover functional
protein from aggregates. How ClpB harnesses the energy of ATP
binding and hydrolysis to facilitate the mechanical unfolding of
previously aggregated, stress-damaged proteins remains unclear.
Here, we present crystal structures of the ClpB D2 domain in the
nucleotide-bound and -free states, and the fitted cryoEM structure
of the D2 hexamer ring, which provide a structural understanding
of the ATP power stroke that drives protein translocation through
the ClpB hexamer. We demonstrate that the conformation of the
substrate-translocating pore loop is coupled to the nucleotide
state of the cis subunit, which is transmitted to the neighboring
subunit via a conserved but structurally distinct intersubunit-signaling pathway common to diverse AAA+ machines. Furthermore,
we found that an engineered, disulfide cross-linked ClpB hexamer
is fully functional biochemically, suggesting that ClpB deoligomerization is not required for protein disaggregation.

2.35-Å resolution (form I), the apo structure could not be resolved beyond 4 Å despite extensive efforts to improve the diffraction quality of those crystals (Table S1).
As anticipated, the crystal structures of the isolated D2 domain
resemble that of the D2 domain in the full-length protein (5) and
form a clamp around the nucleotide (Fig. 1A). Surprisingly, despite lacking ATPase activity, all six copies of the nucleotidebound conformer unequivocally showed bound ADP in simulated
annealed omit maps (Fig. 1A), resulting from either spontaneous
ATP hydrolysis or presence of ADP in commercial ATP preparations. Indeed, it was previously reported that the ClpB D2 domain binds ADP two orders of magnitude more tightly than ATP
(37). The higher affinity for ADP could explain the bound ADP
molecule in our crystal structure.
Structural comparison of the six independent representations
of the ADP-bound conformer gave a rmsd of 0.54  0.16 Å when
superimposed pairwise through their Cα atoms (excluding residues 637–650 and 719–725), indicating that the overall structure
and relative orientation of the large α∕β and small α-helical subdomains are essentially the same. However, unlike previously determined ClpB structures, the substrate-translocating pore loop
(residues 637–650) is ordered in four copies and adopts essentially the same conformation (Fig. 1A and Fig. S2E). The other
two copies feature a pore loop that is partially ordered and
adopts an alternate conformation because of crystal packing
interactions (Fig. S2F). However, the pore loop was completely

Fitted CryoEM Structure of the D2 Hexamer Ring. To examine the
structure of the D2 subunit interface in the ring assembly, we
fitted the X-ray structures of the D2-ADP and apo D2 domain
into the mass densities that were previously attributed to the D2
ring in the cryoEM reconstructions of full-length ClpB (8). The
resulting atomic structure fits are fully compatible with the
cryoEM maps (Fig. 1B and Figs. S3 and S4). Our new fits differ
from our previous ClpB–AMPPNP model (8) by a 17° rotation
along an axis that is almost perpendicular to the sixfold axis of
the ClpB hexamer and a 2.5-Å translation from its center of mass
for the D2-ADP hexamer, and an 8° rotation and a 2.8-Å translation for the apo D2 hexamer. Notably, in the D2-ADP hexamer
structure, the pore loops line the axial channel (Fig. 1B and
Fig. S3), which is consistent with their proposed role in substrate
translocation (21). The α∕β domain of one D2 subunit and the
small α-helical domain of its neighbor contribute primarily to
the subunit interface, which is similar to the subunit arrangement
in the recently determined crystal structure of the ClpC hexamer
complex (10) (Fig. S5).
To confirm our hexamer model, we used structure-based
mutagenesis to introduce pairs of cysteines at the D2 domain interface in full-length ClpB (Fig. 2A). The rationale behind this
approach was to engineer cysteine pairs, which could potentially
form a disulfide bond between neighboring subunits to generate a
cross-linked ClpB hexamer. It is entirely fortuitous that Thermus
thermophilus ClpB lacks cysteines in its amino acid sequence, allowing us to introduce unique cysteine pairs at different locations.
Three disulfide-forming ClpB variants were engineered, namely:
ClpBR576C∕A821C , ClpBL581C∕R776C , and ClpBN746C∕R810C , as well
as a single-cysteine mutant (ClpBR576C ) and one that featured
a mismatched cysteine pair (ClpBL581C∕R726C ) (Fig. 2A).
Upon oxidation, all three disulfide-forming ClpB variants
formed discrete cross-linked oligomers ranging from dimers to
hexamers (Fig. 2 B and C). As anticipated, our single- and mismatched-cysteine mutants remained monomeric or only formed
dimers (Fig. 2B). Notably, ClpBR576C∕A821C formed stable oligomers with the cross-linked ClpB hexamer as the final product
(Fig. 2 C and D and Fig. S6). Cross-linked oligomers were also
observed in the absence of nucleotide (Fig. S7A), although ATP
facilitated the formation of cross-linked hexamers, which is
consistent with its known role in stabilizing the ClpB oligomer
(38, 39). We found that our crosslinked ClpBR576C∕A821C hexamer, like wild-type ClpB, has ATPase activity, which is further stimulated by κ-casein (Fig. 2E), and, most remarkably, cooperated
with DnaKJ/GrpE to rescue heat-aggregated protein substrates
(Fig. 2 F and G). The ability to recover functional protein was
not caused by dissociation of the cross-linked hexamer, because
ClpBR576C∕A821C remained cross-linked even after the refolding
assay was complete (Fig. S7B).
To ensure that the cross-linking procedure did not alter the
structure or function of ClpB, we generated ClpB variants in
the ClpBR576C∕A821C mutant background by changing Leu396,
Leu460, or both, to alanine. We previously showed that mutations
of Leu396 and Leu460 reduced ClpB's chaperone activity, presumably by destabilizing the position of the M-domain (5). Consistently, mutating Leu396 and Leu460 to alanine impaired the
protein disaggregation activity of cross-linked ClpBR576C∕A821C
to a similar extent, which was completely abolished when both
leucine mutations were present (Fig. 2H).
Taken together, our findings suggest that the cross-linked
ClpBR576C∕A821C hexamer is structurally and functionally similar
to the wild-type ClpB hexamer, and, perhaps more importantly,
that ClpB deoligomerization is not required for protein disaggregation.

Arg747 Is a Critical Trans-Acting Element Required for ATP Hydrolysis.

The structure of the ClpB D2 hexamer provides the structural
framework to examine how ATP binding and hydrolysis are
coupled to conformational changes that drive protein disaggregation. It is widely accepted that the ATPase activities in the ClpB
ring complex are regulated by conserved structural elements,
which include the cis-acting Walker A and B and sensor 1 and
2 motifs, and the trans-acting arginine-finger (Arg-finger) residue
(6, 39–41).
It has been suggested that Arg747 is the Arg-finger residue in
T. thermophilus ClpB D2 (41, 42). In our fitted D2 hexamer structure, Arg747 is found at the domain interface and contacts the
bound nucleotide in the neighboring subunit (Fig. 3A). To confirm whether Arg747 is the trans-acting Arg-finger residue, we
mutated Arg747 to alanine in a full-length ClpB mutant background in which the catalytic glutamate (Glu271) of the first
Walker B motif had been additionally mutated to prevent ATP
turnover by the D1 domain. We found that the R747A mutation
Biter et al.

nearly abolished the remaining ATPase activity of ClpBE271A
(Fig. 3B), whereas mutating a close-by arginine (Arg741) to alanine did not, confirming that Arg747 is the Arg-finger residue in
D2 (41), which is required for the ATPase activity in the D2 ring.
Structural Basis for the Allosteric Mechanism of ATP Binding and Hydrolysis in ClpB. Structural comparison of the nucleotide-bound

and -free structures showed that the D2 pore loop is ordered
when ADP is bound (Fig. 1A and Fig. S2 D and E), but disordered
in the absence of nucleotide (Fig. S2 A and C), suggesting that the
pore loop conformation is coupled to the nucleotide state of the
cis subunit.
In our structure, the D2 pore loop is stabilized by a β-hairpin
(residues 688–699), which buttresses the D2 pore loop (Fig. 3C).
To examine the functional role of this hairpin, we either deleted
the β-hairpin loop (ClpBΔ691–695 ) or replaced the loop with three
glycines (ClpBΔ690–696∕GGG ). We found that deleting or replacing
the loop impaired ClpB’s ATPase and chaperone function to a

Discussion
Bacterial ClpB and its eukaryotic homologs are ATP-dependent
protein disaggregases, which have the remarkable ability to rescue stress-damaged proteins from a previously aggregated state.
Here, we have presented the complete structure of the ClpB D2
domain, featuring an intact D2 pore loop, which couples the ATP
power stroke to substrate translocation in cis. Moreover, we
demonstrate that deoligomerization of the ClpB hexamer is
not required for protein disaggregation, because our engineered,
disulfide cross-linked ClpB hexamer is fully functional in recovering active protein from aggregates.
Although AAA pore loops can differ in length and sequence
(Fig. S8), they feature a conserved Φ–Xxx–Gly tripeptide motif
(21, 44) and share a common function in substrate translocation.
In our structure, the conformation of the D2 pore loop is controlled by the cis subunit that senses the nucleotide state of the
neighboring subunit through the Arg-finger, Arg747, and transmits this signal to the ISS motif via Asp685 (Fig. 4). From there,
the signal traverses to the Walker B motif through helix D9, and
to the D2 pore loop via the β-hairpin loop that includes His693.
We propose that this signaling network is crucial to sense the nucleotide state in the adjacent subunit and to reset the nucleotide
cycle in the ClpB ring following ATP hydrolysis.

similar extent as the Y643A mutation (Fig. 3 D–F), which nearly
abolished substrate translocation through the ClpB hexamer (21).
Our structure also shows that His693 in the β-hairpin loop forms
stacking interaction with Tyr646 of the pore loop (Fig. 3C).
Notably, mutating His693 to alanine significantly reduced the
ATPase activity to 43% of wild-type level (Fig. 3D), concomitant
with a small but measurable impact on protein disaggregation
(Fig. 3 E–F).
Closer inspection further revealed that the β-hairpin extends
from a network of residues, which are part of a signaling cascade
responsible for sensing the nucleotide state of the neighboring
subunit in the m-AAA protease (43), a distantly related AAA
+ machine. An important element of this intersubunit-signaling
(ISS) motif is an aspartic acid residue, which, in the m-AAA protease, prevents a subunit from hydrolyzing ATP if the neighboring
subunit is also in the ATP-bound state (43). In ClpB, this residue
is Asp685 (Fig. 3C). Notably, mutating Asp685 to alanine not
only impaired ClpB’s ability to turn over ATP (Fig. 3D), but also
significantly reduced its ability to recover heat-aggregated protein
substrates (Fig. 3 E and F), indicating that the ISS motif is conserved and has similar function in diverse AAA+ machines.

D2E668A∕I683M∕L706M∕L770M were generated by site-directed mutagenesis from
ClpB, ClpBE271A , or D2E668A (residues 542–854). Constructs were cloned into
pET24a, which harbors a noncleavable C-terminal His6 -tag to facilitate
protein purification. In cases where multiple mutations were introduced,
site-directed mutagenesis was carried out stepwise. All constructs were
verified by DNA sequencing.
Protein Expression and Purification. Plasmids harboring full-length ClpB, ClpB
variants, or D2E668A were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 CodonPlus
(DE3)-RIL cells, and were cultured in 2xYT media supplemented with
50 μg∕mL kanamycin and 34 μg∕mL chloramphenicol to select for plasmids.
Cells were grown at 37 °C to midlog phase, induced with 0.5 mM isopropyl
β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), and harvested after 12 h of continuous
growth at 24 °C. Proteins were purified by column chromatography using
Ni-NTA sepharose followed by Superdex-200 for full-length ClpB and Q-sepharose for D2E668A. SeMet-substituted D2E668A∕I683M∕L706M∕L770M was prepared
by transforming E. coli B834 (DE3) cells. Cells were grown at 37 °C for 16 h in
minimal media containing 40 μg∕ml SeMet, induced with 0.5 mM IPTG,
and allowed to grow for another 8 h at 37 °C. Proteins were purified by
Ni-NTA sepharose followed by Q-sepharose. Protein concentrations were
determined as described (49), using a molar extinction coefficient of
51;780 M −1 ·cm −1 for full-length ClpB and 14;650 M −1 ·cm −1 for D2 variants.
T. thermophilus DnaKJ/DafA and GrpE were purified essentially as described (16).
Crystallization. The nucleotide-bound D2 complex was crystallized by the
hanging-drop vapor-diffusion technique by mixing 4 μl of D2E668A or SeMetlabeled D2E668A∕I683M∕L706M∕L770M protein (10 mg∕ml in 40 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5,
100 mM KCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mM ATP, 5 mM MgCl2 ) with 4 μl of reservoir
solution consisting of 100 mM sodium citrate pH 5.5 and 10% isopropanol
(form I), or 200 mM NH4 OAc and 20% PEG 3350 (form II). Crystals of the
apo form were obtained similarly by mixing 4 μl of D2E668A protein
(10 mg∕ml in 40 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 10% glycerol) with 4 μl
reservoir solution [200 mM ðNH4 Þ2 SO4 , 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 25% PEG
3350, 20 mM 1,6-hexanediol].
Data Collection, Processing, and Refinement. For data collection, crystal form I
and form II were harvested in mother liquor supplemented with 50%
(vol∕vol) PEG 200, and 30% (vol∕vol) glycerol, respectively. Apo crystals
were flash-frozen in mother liquor containing an additional 10% (vol∕vol)
glycerol. X-ray diffraction data were collected at the NSLS X25 (form I,
D2E668A∕I683M∕L706M∕L770M ), and APS–SBC ID-19 beamlines (form I, D2E668A , form

II, and Apo). Data were processed and scaled using HKL2000 (50). Crystal
structures of the nucleotide-bound and -free D2 domains were determined
by molecular replacement using Phaser in CCP4 (51). Structure refinement
and map calculations were done using CCP4 (51) and CNS (52), and were interspersed with manual rebuilding of the model using Coot (53). Finally,
structures were refined by TLS and gradient minimization, using multigroup
TLS models generated by the TLSMD web server (54). Figures were generated
with PyMOL (55) and UCSF Chimera (56).
CryoEM Fit. The crystal structure of D2-ADP was superimposed onto the D2
domain of the previous ClpB–AMPPNP hexamer fit (8). This arrangement resulted in steric clashes between neighboring D2 pore loops. Therefore, the fit
of the D2 monomer was adjusted manually, keeping the D2 hexamer ring
within the boundary of the cryoEM density (EMD-1244). The apo D2 domain
was fitted similarly into the apo ClpB cryoEM density (EMD-1241).
Disulfide Cross-Linking. Engineered cysteine-containing ClpB mutants
(1.5 mg∕ml) in 40 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 10% glycerol were incubated at 55 °C in the presence of 5 mM ATP, 5 mM MgCl2 , 10 μM CuCl2 , and
10 μM 1,10-phenanthroline for 20 min unless indicated otherwise. Reactions
were quenched by adding 20 mM (final) EDTA. Formation of disulfide bonds
was followed by nonreducing 3–8% Tris-acetate gradient PAGE.
Analytical Size-Exclusion Chromatography. ClpB and ClpBR576C∕A821C were analyzed on a Superdex 200 10∕300 size-exclusion column preequilibrated with
40 mM MOPS-NaOH pH 7.5 and 100 mM KCl.
ATPase Assay. ATPase activities were measured with or without 0.1 mg∕mL κcasein at 50 °C in 40 mM MOPS–NaOH pH 7.5, 150 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2
using 0.1–0.5 μM ClpB (monomer), 10 mM ATP, and a coupled ATP-regenerating system consisting of 0.2 μM pyruvate kinase, 0.5 μM lactate dehydrogenase, 0.5 mM phosphoenolpyruvate, and 0.2 mM NADH. ATP-hydrolysis
rates were calculated from the oxidation of NADH, which was monitored
by absorbance at 340 nm.
Protein Disaggregation Assays. Recombinant Bacillus stearothermophilus αglucosidase (0.2 μM) was heat-denatured in refolding buffer A (25 mM
HEPES–NaOH pH 7.5, 150 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2 , 5 mM ATP) at 73 °C for
12 min in the presence of 0.2 μM DnaKJ–DafA complex (trimer) and
0.1 μM GrpE (monomer). The aggregate was immediately diluted 20-fold into
refolding buffer A containing 0.3 μM ClpB (monomer), 0.2 μM DnaKJ-DafA
complex (trimer), and 0.1 μM GrpE (monomer), and incubated at 55 °C for
40 min. To measure the recovered α-glucosidase activity, p-nitrophenyl glucopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 2 mM. The reaction mixture was incubated at 55 °C for 20 min and stopped with 0.4 M (final) sodium
carbonate. The amount of p-nitrophenol released was measured by absorbance at 400 nm.
Purified enhanced GFP (EGFP, 3 μM) was heat-denatured in refolding buffer A at 80 °C for 10 min in the presence of 0.2 μM DnaKJ–DafA complex (trimer) and 0.1 μM GrpE (monomer). The aggregate was immediately diluted
12-fold into buffer A containing 0.3 μM ClpB (monomer), 0.2 μM DnaKJ-DafA
complex (trimer), and 0.1 μM GrpE (monomer). The amount of refolded EGFP
was monitored continuously at 25 °C for 40 min using a LS55 fluorescence
spectrometer at an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and emission wavelength of 510 nm.
Recombinant firefly luciferase (1 μM) was heat-denatured in refolding
buffer B [25 mM MOPS–NaOH pH 7.5, 150 mM KOAc, and 10 mM
MgðOAcÞ2 ] at 42 °C for 30 min in the presence of 5 mM ATP and 1 μM
DnaKJ/GrpE (monomer). The aggregate was immediately diluted 10-fold into
refolding buffer B containing 1 μM ClpB (monomer), 1 μM DnaKJ/GrpE
(monomer), and an ATP-regenerating system consisting of 5 mM ATP,
20 mM phosphoenolpyruvate, and 0.2 μM pyruvate kinase. Reactions were
incubated at 25 °C for 2 h, and the amount of recovered enzymatic activity
was measured at 560 nm after addition of 0.1 μM luciferin.

BIOPHYSICS AND
COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY

The existence of an ISS network that regulates ATP hydrolysis
in diverse AAA+ ring complexes is also consistent with a sequential ATP-hydrolysis mechanism proposed for ClpB (45, 46) and
Hsp104 (47), with four out of six subunits in the ClpB homohexamer occupied by nucleotides at any one time (46). This model is
similar to the staircase mechanism proposed for the T7 gene 4
ring helicase (48), and is consistent with the nucleotide occupancy
observed in the crystal structure of an engineered, covalently
linked ClpX hexamer (11). In our model (Fig. 4), the unfolded
polypeptide is bound to ClpB in the ATP-bound state, which displays the highest substrate-binding affinity (8, 36). ATP hydrolysis
triggers substrate translocation along the hexamer axis. Once hydrolyzed, release of ADP results in substrate dissociation from
the cis subunit, concomitant with binding of the unfolded polypeptide by the ATP-bound neighboring subunit. The cycle repeats
itself until the substrate is fully translocated through the hexamer ring.
Finally, the conservation of the ISS motif in diverse AAA+
ATPases also suggests that similar structural elements may drive
the ATP power stroke in other AAA+ machines, and support a
common, ATP-fueled mechanism underlying the distinct cellular
activities of diverse AAA+ ATPases.
