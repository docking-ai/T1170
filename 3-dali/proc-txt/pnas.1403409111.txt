The 26S proteasome is a 2.5 MDa molecular machine that executes
the degradation of substrates of the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway. The molecular architecture of the 26S proteasome was
recently established by cryo-EM approaches. For a detailed understanding of the sequence of events from the initial binding of
polyubiquitylated substrates to the translocation into the proteolytic core complex, it is necessary to move beyond static structures
and characterize the conformational landscape of the 26S proteasome. To this end we have subjected a large cryo-EM dataset acquired in the presence of ATP and ATP-γS to a deep classification
procedure, which deconvolutes coexisting conformational states.
Highly variable regions, such as the density assigned to the largest
subunit, Rpn1, are now well resolved and rendered interpretable.
Our analysis reveals the existence of three major conformations: in
addition to the previously described ATP-hydrolyzing (ATPh) and
ATP-γS conformations, an intermediate state has been found. Its
AAA-ATPase module adopts essentially the same topology that is
observed in the ATPh conformation, whereas the lid is more similar
to the ATP-γS bound state. Based on the conformational ensemble
of the 26S proteasome in solution, we propose a mechanistic
model for substrate recognition, commitment, deubiquitylation,
and translocation into the core particle.

Because of the structural heterogeneity of the 26S proteasome
the highest resolution insights into its structure come from cryoEM SPA studies rather than X-ray crystallography; SPA is more
tolerant of structural heterogeneity. In SPA large numbers of
projections of single particles are combined in a 3D model. If the
particles in the dataset differ in conformation, the reconstruction
is a blurred convolute of the coexisting structures. The relatively
high resolution obtained with 26S proteasome particles in the
presence of ATP suggests that the 26S proteasome adopts a preferred conformation (9). In fact, a 7.4-Å resolution reconstruction
allowed the creation of an atomic model for the ATP-hydrolyzing
(ATPh) state (10). Nevertheless, the variance map from the individual particles in the dataset revealed a considerable degree
of structural heterogeneity that most likely limited the attainable
spatial resolution.
A subnanometer-resolution reconstruction was also obtained
from 26S proteasomes in the presence of the slowly hydrolyzable
ATP analog ATP-γS; this fact indicates that the 26S proteasome
adopts a predominant conformation also under these conditions
(17). In the ATP-γS structure the AAA-ATPase module undergoes a topological change concomitant with an overall translation
and rotation aligning the channel traversing the AAA-ATPase
ring where substrate unfolding takes place and the CP gate controlling access to the CP. The rearrangement of the AAA-ATPase
module induces a large-scale conformational change of the surrounding Rpn subunits. For the ATP-γS dataset, variance analysis

n the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway (UPP) the 26S proteasome performs the degradation of intracellular proteins
marked for destruction by the covalent attachment of polyubiquitin chains (1–5). The 2.5 MDa complex consists of the
barrel-shaped 20S core particle (CP) as well as one or two copies
of the 19S regulatory particle (RP) controlling the entry of
substrates into the proteolytic chamber of the CP. The structure
of the CP was solved by X-ray crystallography a long time ago (6,
7); whereas, the molecular architecture of the 26S holocomplex
was determined only recently using cryo-EM single-particle
analysis (SPA) approaches (8–10). The RP comprises a ringshaped AAA-ATPase heterohexamer (Rpt1-6) responsible for
substrate unfolding and translocation across the CP gate and 13
RP non-ATPases (Rpn1-3, 5–13, 15) surrounding the AAAATPase module. The role of the Rpns is the acceptance of
substrates and their deubiquitylation. For a full mechanistic
understanding of the early steps of substrate processing it is essential to reveal its dynamics.
The compositional and conformational heterogeneity of 26S
proteasome preparations makes the structural characterization
of this molecular machine challenging (11). Compositional heterogeneity results from multiple proteins that interact with the
26S proteasome substoichiometrically, such as deubiquitylating
enzymes (DUBs) or shuttling ubiquitin (Ub) receptors. Conformational switching of the 26S proteasome is mostly driven by
ATP binding and hydrolysis. Each of the six distinct Rpt subunits
is able to bind and hydrolyze ATP (12–14), which may theoretically give rise to a large number of different conformational
states. To what extent ATP hydrolysis of the different AAAATPase subunits is spatially coordinated, e.g., in a cyclic mechanism (15), or stochastic (16) is currently under debate.

Significance
The 26S proteasome is a multisubunit molecular machine for
the targeted degradation of intracellular proteins. It has an
essential role in the maintenance of protein homeostasis.
During its functional cycle the proteasome undergoes largescale conformational changes. For a detailed mechanistic understanding, an analysis of its conformational landscape is indispensable. Capitalizing on a very large dataset of more than
3 million individual particles and using a novel image-classification strategy, we have been able to deconvolute coexisting
conformational states. This led to the discovery of conformation
intermediates that provide deeper insights into the sequence of
events following the initial binding of ubiquitylated substrates.

Combined Classification in Pixel and Coordinate Space. To decon-

volute coexisting conformations in SPA datasets, an assignment
to different conformers is included into the protocol used for
image alignment and 3D reconstruction. In our algorithm, the
individual particles are provisionally aligned with respect to
a single reference and then classified and refined by a multistep
protocol (Fig. S1). The starting point is to group the particles
into a large number of density classes using an implementation of
the focused classification method first described in ref. 18. In
essence, this algorithm groups single particles according to their
best-matching reference and allows for refinement of particle
alignment. This clustering method is a (quasi) expectation maximization approach (19, 20). This and other classification
methods tend to divide the particles evenly among classes. Thus,
when weakly populated conformers are present in an “unbalanced” dataset its members are often assigned to larger
classes, leaving the conformer undetected. In our clustering
strategy we sought to overcome this problem by vastly oversampling the number of classes used; the number of classes
exceeds the anticipated number of conformations in the data by
far. Thus, the sensitivity toward low-abundance conformers is
increased at the expense of redundancy in the resulting class
densities. We refer to the classes from this first round of densitybased classification as oversampled classes (OCs).
For the analysis of the OCs, first poorly defined, typically
“smeared,” OCs and the particles corresponding to them are
removed from the dataset. These OCs typically represent particles with particularly low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) or other
defects that preclude accurate alignment. To remove redundancy
among the remaining OCs we chose to rigid-body fit atomic
models into the densities and clustered the OCs hierarchically according to the root-mean-squared deviations (RMSDs) of

their corresponding coordinates in specific components of the
holocomplex. The coordinate-based merging approach has four
advantages over removing redundancy by directly clustering the
corresponding densities in voxel space: (i) Clustering can be
performed according to specific components of the macromolecule of interest; in voxel space, a fixed mask would roughly
define the focus of interest, where the target components may
move in and out. (ii) The classification can be rendered relatively
insensitive to alignment differences of the particles; the atomic
models or parts of it can be superposed, which avoids the classification according to differences in the coordinate systems. (iii)
In contrast to the densities, the atomic models are by definition
noise-free. The fitting error due to noise in the underlying
densities can be assessed (SI Materials and Methods). (iv) The
deviation of models according to the RMSD, which is a length
measure, is easier to interpret than abstract measures for similarities of densities such as a correlation coefficient.
Particles grouped accordingly are then subjected to another
round of iterative alignment. The resulting reconstructions typically yield substantially higher resolution than the OCs because
more particles contribute to fewer classes. The reconstructions
are used to build corresponding atomic models, again keeping
subunit domains rigid unless the resolution is better than 10 Å.
Classification of 26S Proteasome Particles. We analyzed two different 26S proteasome datasets acquired in the presence of
hydrolysable ATP (ATPh dataset) (10) and in the presence of
ATP-γS (ATP-γS dataset) (17). The ATP-γS data were tripled
compared with a previous study (17). Image analysis focused on
proteasome halves to allow for deviations from a C2 symmetry
(10). From the focused classification of the merged data we
retained 95 OCs out of an initial 140 OCs after filtering. Visual
inspection of the individual images contributing to the discarded
OCs suggests that they typically capture partially (dis)assembled
proteasomes or that they suffer from a very low SNR preventing
accurate alignment. The remaining 95 OCs represented 2.2 million
26S halves (1,442,139 in presence of ATP and 769,995 in presence
of ATP-γS). The number of OCs, 95, is well beyond the anticipated
number of conformers in the data. A strictly cyclic model for AAAATPase function, e.g., would imply a maximum of six distinct RP
conformations. The resolutions of these OCs were on average
18 Å, and we low-pass filtered the densities accordingly to obtain
corresponding pseudoatomic models by fitting rigid bodies derived
from the ATPh model (10). Visual inspection of the fitted models
suggests that the models explain the densities well (Fig. 1).
We chose to first cluster the OCs based on the heterohexameric
Proteasome-COP9-Initiation factor 3 (PCI) horseshoe formed by
Rpn3/5/6/7/9/12 for three reasons (Fig. S2): (i) this feature is
easily recognizable at the resolution of the OCs; (ii) visual inspection suggested that the atomic fits were accurate in this area;

in the hierarchical tree. For each state a representative of an OC and its corresponding atomic model

indicated an even larger structural heterogeneity than for the
ATPh dataset. It is conceivable that the ATPh and ATP-γS
structures correspond to predominant states under the respective
sample conditions, but other conformations are likely to coexist in
both datasets.
Here we perform a deep classification of more than 3 million 26S
proteasome particles in the presence of both, ATP and ATP-γS,
to identify low-abundance conformational states of the holocomplex.
To group single-particle projections with respect to different underlying conformers we developed a computational method that
combines focused classification and rigid-body fitting of atomic
models into EM maps. The resulting conformational ensemble of
the 26S proteasome provides insights into the mechanisms of substrate recognition, commitment, deubiquitylation, and translocation
into the CP.

and (iii) the PCI horseshoe adopts different conformations in the
ATPh- and ATP-γS bound states (17). We superposed the PCI
heterohexamers from all models to that in the ATPh structure
(PDB code: 4b4t) and determined their pairwise RMSD matrix,
which was used for hierarchical clustering (Fig. 1).
The hierarchical tree of the 95 PCI horseshoe models reveals
two distinctly different branches, which divide at an RMSD level
of ∼10 Å (Fig. 1). Comparison of the models in the two branches
suggests that they resemble the PCI module in the ATPh and
ATP-γS structure, respectively. The ATPh-like branch (cluster
s1) does not divide further above the significance level, whereas
the ATP-γS–like branch is separated into two clusters, s2 and s3,
at an RMSD value of ∼5 Å. Cluster s3 resembles the PCI conformer of the ATP-γS structure; whereas, the models in cluster
s2 differ, in particular in the conformations of the N termini of
Rpn5 and Rpn6.
We then extended the classification to the Rpns adjacent to
the PCI heterohexamer. When including Rpn2 into the clustering the same classification was obtained (Fig. S3). Rpn10,
Rpn13, and Sem1 were not included in the analysis due to their
small size, which did not allow accurate fitting of these subunits
into the low-resolution OCs. Thus, we conclude that the lid together with the adjacent base subunit Rpn2 adopts three distinctly different conformations in our datasets.
For the analysis of the structural variability in the AAAATPase hexamer the models in clusters s1–s3 were again superposed onto the PCI hexamers and clustered according to the
AAA-ATPase module. This analysis reveals that s1 and s2 are
essentially invariable within the error bar of our clustering
method (Fig. S4). In contrast, the clustering of the models in s3
reveals significant structural differences.
Equilibrium of Different Conformations Under Different Buffer
Conditions. We next analyzed the relative distribution of the

conformations in the two datasets acquired in the presence of
4 mM ATP and 1 mM ATP-γS, respectively. In the ATPh dataset
only two of the three major conformations were present: 82% of
the particles adopted s1 and 18% the conformation s2. Because
s1 is highly similar to the previously determined ATPh structure,
these findings are consistent with our assumption that the ATPh
state is the predominant conformation in ATP containing buffer;
the ratio of s1:s2 is 4:1 (Fig. S5).
In contrast, all three major conformations are present in the
ATP-γS dataset: 21.2% of particles were assigned to s1, 5.4% to
s2, and 73.4% to s3. Again, the prevalence of s3 is consistent with
the unclassified reconstruction being very similar to the previously reported ATP-γS structure. The more divergent conformational distribution in the ATP-γS dataset compared with the
ATP data are also in agreement with the higher variance observed in the single reference reconstruction compared with the
unclassified reconstruction obtained from the ATP dataset (21).
Interestingly, the ratio of the less abundant states s1 and s2 is
also ∼4:1 in the ATP-γS dataset.
We also analyzed the correlations of states of the two RPs of
each proteasome particle; the RP states are essentially statistically distributed under both buffer conditions (Fig. S5). Consistent with this finding alignment and reconstruction of particles
with mixed RP states yields densities that clearly deviate from
C2 symmetry.
Distinct 26S Proteasome Conformations at Subnanometer Resolution
and Fitting of Atomic Models. To obtain higher resolution struc-

tures of the different conformers we subjected the in silico purified particles from the different classes to independent alignment
and reconstruction yielding resolutions of 7.7, 9.3, and 8.8 Å for
s1, s2, and s3, respectively (Fig. 1, Figs. S2 and S6, and Movie S1
and S2). In the RP the resolutions of s1 and s3 are significantly
higher than those of the unclassified densities, 8.3 (10) and 9.9 Å
(21), respectively.
For the molecular interpretation we flexibly fitted atomic models
into these subnanometer resolution maps. We also incorporated

atomic structures of the dimer of the Rpn8/Rpn11 Mpr1-Pad1
N-terminal (MPN) domains (22), a major portion of Rpn12 (23)
and Csn1 (24), a paralog of Rpn7, a computational model of the
helical lid bundle (25), and the location of the C-terminal segment
Sem1 in the 26S holocomplex (26).
Atomic Model of s1. The AAA-ATPase heterohexamer comprises
two stacked rings, the AAA ring formed by the AAA segments
and the OB ring assembled from the oligosaccharide-binding
fold (OB) domains (Fig. 2). The structures and positions of the
AAA and OB domains of the ATPase heterohexamer were well
resolved previously, but the improved resolution attained here
also reveals the linkers between the OB ring and AAA ring for
most subunits. As described previously the intersubunit modules
(ISMs) formed by the large AAA domains of a subunit with the
small AAA domain of its neighbor adopt two distinct topologies
throughout the heterohexamer giving rise to a spiral shape of the
AAA ring (9, 10, 17); the Rpt6/3 ISM is similar to the topology
observed with the proteasome-activating nucleotidase (PAN)ADP crystal structure (27) whereas the other five ISMs are
arranged as observed for ClpX (28).
Due to high structural variability of Rpn1 (18, 29) the resolution of this subunit was insufficient to build a reliable model for
this subunit in earlier reconstructions (10). After classification,
secondary structure elements are resolved well enough in s1 to
put forward an atomic model (Fig. 2B). Superposition of the
atomic models of Rpn1 and Rpn2 reveals high similarity of both
subunits with the notable exception of the N-terminal segment,
which is rigidly rotated by ∼40° around a linker helix (residues
95–119 and 153–175 for Rpn2 and Rpn1, respectively) in the two
subunits. The EM density connecting Rpn1 and the OB ring
indicates that a coiled coil consisting of at least three helices
tethers Rpn1 to the AAA-ATPase module (Fig. S7). Two of
these helices must correspond to Rpt1 and Rpt2 whereas the
third helix is likely contributed by a ∼100 residue stretch of Rpn1
that is not included in the atomic model; secondary structure
prediction suggests that a significant part of this region is involved in a coiled coil (Fig. S7). However, the helices in the
bundle cannot be traced completely in the EM map and assignment therefore remains ambiguous. Compared with all other
RP subunits, the resolution of Rpn1 is nevertheless still modest,
which is due to the residual structural variability of this subunit
(Fig. S8).
In the lid region, the improved resolution reveals the connecting loops between the PCI domains and the C-terminal helices of the helical bundle for three subunits (Rpn5, Rpn7, and
Rpn12), all consistent with the model in ref. 25. With the help of
the Csn1 crystal structure (24) the N-terminal region of Rpn7
could be modeled almost completely (Fig. 2C). The crystal
structure of the MPN-dimer Rpn8/Rpn11 (22) is also in excellent agreement with the cryo-EM density (Fig. 2D). The
active site of Rpn11 is positioned near the coiled coils of Rpt4/5,
∼20 Å away from the pseudosixfold axis of the OB ring. Docking
of Ub to Rpn11 based on the crystal structure of Ub2 bound to the
associated molecule with the 3 domain of STAM-like protein
(AMSH-LP) (30), a closely related DUB, suggests that the UbUnverdorben et al.

ellipse indicates the composite active site of Rpn11.
(C) The position of Rpn11 above the OB ring differs
in s1 (green) compared with s2 (blue) and s3 (red).

Atomic Model of s2. In the atomic model corresponding to the s2
density the AAA-ATPase heterohexamer adopts essentially the
same arrangement of ISMs and OB ring as seen in s1 with the
notable exception of a differing bending of the coiled coil dimers
of Rpt6/3 making extensive contact with the lid and Rpn2, and
Rpt4/5, which in turn contacts Rpn10 (Fig. 3). However, the
AAA module is positioned differently in s1 and s2: in s2 it is
translated by ∼5 Å and laterally slightly rotated (∼1°) in addition
to being less tilted (∼2°; Fig. 4A). This transformation positions
Rpt2, Rpt6, and Rpt3 farther from the CP, and Rpt2 is in closer
vicinity to the N terminus of Rpn1. Rpn1 itself is translated and
rotated by about 35° positioning its N/C domain closer to the
AAA-ATPase module and the CP (Fig. S10).
The lid, together with Rpn2 and Rpn10, undergoes a dramatic
motion with respect to the AAA module, which can be mostly
described as a rigid-body rotation of 25° (Fig. 4C). Major rearrangements are only observed in the N-terminal domains of
Rpn5 and Rpn6 (Fig. 4D). The interactions between lid, ATPase,
and CP differ in s2 when compared with s1. Rpn5 does not interact with the ATPase module anymore whereas the interface
with α1 is enlarged (Fig. S9). Rpn6 retains its contacts with the

ATPases and CP, but the interactions sites differ. The contacts
between Rpn7 and Rpt6 remain essentially identical. As a result
of the en bloc motion of the Rpns, the Rpn8/11 MPN dimer is
translated by ∼25 Å, positioning the Rpn11 active site along the
pseudosixfold axis of the OB ring (Fig. 3). The OB ring and
insertion 2 of Rpn11, a structurally variable mostly helical segment (22), form a narrow cage around Rpn11. Docking of Ub to
Rpn11 reveals that the Ub-binding site is also accessible in state
s2; at the same time the space for accommodation of the substrate is enlarged compared with s1 (Fig. 3). A further consequence of the lid motion is the repositioning of Rpn10 with
respect to the coiled coils of Rpt4/5.
Atomic Model of s3. In the AAA-ATPase module the PAN-ADPlike ISM is repositioned from Rpt6/3 to Rpt5/1 compared with s1
and s2, which results in an overall change of AAA-ring topology
reported previously (17, 31). The AAA module is positioned
essentially planar on top of the CP (tilt is reduced by ∼3 degrees
compared with s2), laterally rotated by ∼8°, and translated by ∼6 Å
(Fig. 4A). This transformation aligns the gate of the CP and the
pores of the AAA module. The motion is even larger for the
OB ring: compared with s2 this module is translated by ∼17.5 Å.
The structures of the coiled coils remain essentially unchanged
compared with s2. Upon transition from s2 to s3, Rpn1 undergoes a rigid-body motion in concert with the adjacent OB ring
(Fig. S10).
The structural differences of the lid/Rpn2 module in s2 and s3
focus on the N-terminal TPR-like domains of Rpn5 and Rpn6,
which bend slightly differently (Fig. 4D). The lid–ATPase and
lid–CP contacts are essentially identical in s2 and s3, indicating
that the structural changes of Rpn5 and Rpn6 retain the protein–
protein contacts during the topology change of the ATPase
module from s2 to s3 (Fig. S9). The position of the lid/Rpn2

binding site is accessible, but there is little space to accommodate
substrates (Fig. 3).
For a comparison of the different 26S proteasome conformations we analyzed the interactions of the lid with the AAAATPase module and the CP in more detail. The PCI-subunits
Rpn5, Rpn6, and Rpn7 contact these modules at several sites
(Cα-Cα distance < 6 Å; Fig. S9): through their N-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat (TPRs) Rpn5 and Rpn6 interact with
AAA-ATPase subunits Rpt6 and Rpt3 and CP subunits α1 and
α2, respectively; whereas, Rpn7 only interacts with Rpt6 through
well-resolved loops.

module with respect to the OB ring is similar in s2 and s3, and
hence the local environment of the Rpn11 active site is essentially identical (Fig. 3C). Also the arrangement of most other lid
subunits appears unchanged in these two conformations, and
Rpn10 is positioned similarly with respect to the Rpt4/5 coiled
coils and the OB ring.
Heterogeneity of AAA-ATPase Module. Further classification of the
OCs within the three modes, s1, s2, and s3, according to the AAAATPase module only revealed significant structural variability for
s3 (Fig. S4). We grouped the particles from s3 into four classes and
subjected them to refinement and reconstruction. Three of those
reconstructions were of subnanometer resolution and atomic
models of the AAA-ATPase were fitted. These models indicate
that the topology of AAA-ATPases remains invariant but the ISMs
undergo substantial motions. We refrained from a more detailed
interpretation of the atomic models, which would require higherresolution reconstructions.

Discussion
Classification Method. For the deconvolution of coexisting conformations in single-particle datasets of 26S proteasomes, a classification step has been included into the computational protocol
for image alignment and 3D reconstruction. Thus, different particle projections are not only grouped according to their projection
direction, but also with respect to different conformers. Major
challenges in the simultaneous alignment and classification of
single-particle data are the low SNR of the images and the detection of conformations with low occupancy (unbalanced data).
Previous approaches to classification of single-particle data
into conformers exclusively rooted in pixel/voxel space (reviewed
in ref. 32). In our method we combined such an image-based
classification, a focused classification method (18) similar to that
first introduced by Penczek et al. (33), with hierarchical clustering of atomic models fitted to the resulting class densities.
Choosing a very large number of clusters for the initial focused
classification allows detection of low-occupancy states and
model-based classification is used to merge redundant classes.
Major advantages of using atomic models for this second classification step are convenient focusing on specific parts of the
assembly, robustness to alignment differences in the class densities, and an easily interpretable measure for class differences
(RMSD between atomic models).
Using this approach we could identify a previously undetected
conformer of the 26S proteasome (s2), which has an abundance
of only 5% in one of the two datasets (ATP-γS containing
buffer). Moreover, we could obtain reconstructions of the two
previously known 26S proteasome conformers, s1 and s3, at
significantly improved resolution allowing to put forward more
complete atomic models of the 26S proteasome ensemble.
Coexistence of Three Major 26S Conformations. The s1 map revealed
the secondary structure elements of the previously poorly resolved subunit Rpn1 (9, 10, 17), which allowed putting forward an
atomic model for this subunit. Moreover, the 7.7-Å density and
the availability of suitable templates allowed us to model the
complete lid. Using the s1 model as a starting point, we could then
also build atomic models for s2 and s3 using the corresponding
subnanometer-resolution reconstructions. The atomic models suggest that s2 is an intermediate state between s1 and s3. The
ATPase module remains in essentially the same conformation as
in s1, but is translated by ∼5 Å; whereas, the lid together with
Rpn2 is in a position and conformation similar to s3.
The relative abundance of the three states in the different
buffers provides some clues regarding their nucleotide states. The
state s3 is only populated in the presence of the slowly hydrolysable
ATP analog ATP-γS, suggesting that this is a high-energy prehydrolysis state with a maximum number of nucleotides bound. Like
other AAA-ATPases (34, 35) the 26S proteasome appears to bind
a maximum of four nucleotides (15). In the bacterial RP homolog
ClpX the two unoccupied ATP-binding sites are suggested to be in
5548 | www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1403409111

opposite positions of the hexameric ring with one site being in an
unloadable conformation and the other site is in a loadable state
(36). This results in a symmetrical distribution of nucleotides as
suggested previously for the 26S proteasome (15). Because of the
absence of the Arg finger Rpt1 is likely unloadable implying that
Rpt3 is empty; the remaining four sites may be occupied by
nucleotides, presumably all ATP-γS.
The other two states, s1 and s2, are observed in the presence
of both, ATP and ATP-γS. Remarkably, the relative abundance
of s1:s2 is ∼4:1 for both conditions. It is reasonable to assume
that s1 corresponds to the ground state because it is more abundant. At the current resolution the nucleotide-binding states of the
different Rpt subunits cannot be determined in the two states.
Thus, it is not clear whether transition from s1 to s2 requires ATP
hydrolysis, but the magnitude of the conformational change makes
it likely.
Detailed analysis of the conformations of the AAA-ATPase
module revealed structural heterogeneity for s3. These structural
changes appear nevertheless small compared with topology differences between s3 and s2/s1. In particular, the unloadable ISM
modules are exclusively located at Rpt6/3 and Rpt5/1 in s3 and
s1/s2, respectively, suggesting that the translocation mechanism
of the proteasomal AAA-ATPase heterohexamer is not symmetrical across the ring subunits, consistent with conclusions
from systematic mutagenesis studies (14).
Functional Model for Substrate Degradation. The first step in proteasomal degradation of UPP substrates is the low-affinity
binding of polyubiquitin to the proteasomal Ub receptors. There
are no indications that substrate recruitment to the proteasome
requires any type of activation suggesting that they bind primarily
to the most abundant s1 conformer (Fig. 5A). We previously
suggested that simultaneous binding of Ub moieties of a polyubiquitin tag to the Ub receptors Rpn10 and Rpn13 might be
a means to increase affinity to polyubiquitin (37). Furthermore,
the substantial structural variability of Rpn1 in s1 observed here
may enable recruitment of shuttling Ub receptors. Further processing of polyubiquitylated substrates requires the presence of
unstructured or loosely folded segments (38, 39); substrates with
such secondary degrons are committed for degradation in an
ATP-dependent process (40). We hypothesize that conformational switching between s1 and s2 enables commitment for two
major reasons (Fig. 5B): (i) The repositioning of the Ub receptor
Rpn10 is well suited to transfer a substrate to the DUB Rpn11.

Fig. 5. Functional model for substrate degradation. (Left) Substrates (S,
orange) with polyubiquitin tags mostly encounter the s1 state and bind to
the Ub receptors Rpn10 and Rpn13 as well as to Rpn1, which binds shuttling
Ub receptors (all highlighted). (Center) Conformational switching from s1 to
s2, which comprises a 25° rotation of the Rpns and translation of the AAAATPase module, may transfer the substrate to the mouth of the ATPase and
render Rpn11 (magenta) active. Deubiquitylation may occur at this stage or
upon transition to s3. (Right) ATP loading of the AAA-ATPase leads to
transition from s3 to s2, a conformational change of the AAA-ATPase module
and translation of the Rpns, which enables substrate unfolding and translocation into the CP.

Materials and Methods
The 26S proteasomes were purified using a 3x-FLAG tag and imaged on an
FEI Titan transmission electron microscope equipped with a Tietz 8k × 8k
charge-couple device camera as described in ref. 10. Particle alignment and
reconstruction was performed in XMIPP (43) and focused classification was
carried out using the TOM toolbox (18). MDFF was used to obtain atomic
models, superpose models, and compute RMSDs (44). Hierarchical clustering was performed in MATLAB (The Mathworks, Inc.). All images of densities and atomic models were rendered in UCSF Chimera (45). A detailed
description of all protocols is found in the SI Materials and Methods.

This process may require simultaneous binding of the polyubiquitin to the Ub receptor and Rpn11, which could be another
reason for the preferred degradation of polyubiquitylated substrates (9). (ii) Crystallographic data (22) suggest that Rpn11 is
activated by formation of a composite active site to which also
the OB ring and the coiled coils of the AAA-ATPase module
contribute, and which shows chaperone activity (41). The essentially identical architecture of this cavity in s2 and s3 suggests
that deubiquitylation may occur in both states. It has been suggested that s3 represents a high-energy dwell state of the 26S
proteasome and bursts of ATP hydrolysis enable pulling of the
substrate through the ATPase pore into the CP (31) (Fig. 5C).
Single-molecule studies revealed bursts due to simultaneous
conformational changes of 2–4 ATPase subunits for ClpXP (42).
Indeed the high structural variability of the s3 state revealed by
our analysis is consistent with this hypothesis, albeit not a definite proof for this model.
In summary we suggest that the three major conformations of the
26S proteasome represent a substrate-accepting state, a commitment state, and a translocating state. Further cryo-EM studies of
