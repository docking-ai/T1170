Zinc is one of the essential transition metals in cells. Excess or lack of
zinc is detrimental, and cells exploit highly sensitive zinc-binding
regulators to achieve homeostasis. In this article, we present a crystal
structure of active Zur from Streptomyces coelicolor with three zincbinding sites (C-, M-, and D-sites). Mutations of the three sites differentially affected sporulation and transcription of target genes, such
that C- and M-site mutations inhibited sporulation and derepressed
all target genes examined, whereas D-site mutations did not affect
sporulation and derepressed only a sensitive gene. Biochemical and
spectroscopic analyses of representative metal site mutants revealed
that the C-site serves a structural role, whereas the M- and D-sites
regulate DNA-binding activity as an on-off switch and a ﬁne-tuner,
respectively. Consistent with differential effect of mutations on target genes, zinc chelation by TPEN derepressed some genes (znuA,
rpmF2) more sensitively than others (rpmG2, SCO7682) in vivo. Similar pattern of TPEN-sensitivity was observed for Zur-DNA complexes
formed on different promoters in vitro. The sensitive promoters
bound Zur with lower afﬁnity than the less sensitive ones. EDTAtreated apo-Zur gained its DNA binding activity at different concentrations of added zinc for the two promoter groups, corresponding to
free zinc concentrations of 4.5 × 10−16 M and 7.9 × 10−16 M for the
less sensitive and sensitive promoters, respectively. The graded expression of target genes is a clever outcome of subtly modulating
Zur-DNA binding afﬁnities in response to zinc availability. It enables
bacteria to detect metal depletion with improved sensitivity and
optimize gene-expression pattern.

arious transition metal ions are essentially required for cell
growth and survival because they stabilize the folded conformations or mediate chemical reactions of metalloproteins,
which constitute about one-third of all proteins (1, 2). Zinc is an
abundant transition metal that serves as a cofactor for diverse
enzymes and regulatory proteins. It is estimated that about 5% to
10% of all proteins predicted from the genomes of all three
domains of life are zinc-proteins (3). In Escherichia coli the total
zinc content inside the cell is reported to be in the millimolar range,
whereas the zinc-responsive transcriptional regulators respond to
femtomolar (fM) range of free zinc, reﬂecting its dramatic zincbinding capacity and sensitive regulation (4). In bacteria, zinc
homeostasis is regulated primarily by zinc-speciﬁc regulators of the
ferric uptake regulator (Fur) family (Zur), MerR family (ZntR),
and ArsR/SmtB family (SmtB, CzrA) (5). In E. coli, zinc uptake
genes are repressed by Zur, whereas export genes are activated by
ZntR, in femtomolar concentration ranges of free zinc (4). In many
bacteria, zinc depletion causes inactivation of zinc-speciﬁc Zur to
derepress zinc transporter genes (6). In Gram-positive bacteria,
genes for zincless ribosomal proteins are derepressed to replace
zinc-bound paralogs as a way of mobilizing zinc (7–12). Coelibactin, a putative zincophore, has been recently reported to be
regulated by Zur in Streptomyces coelicolor (13, 14). In addition,
Zur can also act as a direct activator to induce a zinc-export system
in Xanthomonas campestris (15).

The Fur family members, widely distributed among bacteria,
are versatile metalloregulators that respond to diverse transition
metals, such as iron, zinc, manganese, and nickel (16, 17). The
mechanisms of metal-speciﬁcity and metal-mediated activity
modulation have been extensively investigated, revealing some
common and speciﬁc principles among members of this family.
Crystal structures of several metal-bound Fur regulators have
been reported for iron-responsive Fur from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PaFur) (18) and Vibrio cholerae (VcFur) (19), zincresponsive Zur from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MtZur) (20),
nickel-responsive Nur from S. coelicolor (ScNur) (21), and peroxide-sensing PerR from Bacillus subtilis (BsPerR) (22). All of the
available structures demonstrate that the Fur family members are
homodimeric and each monomer consists of an N-terminal DNAbinding (DB) domain, a C-terminal dimerization (D) domain, and
a hinge loop between the two. Metal-bound functional proteins
usually exhibit two metal-binding sites. One site lies in the interdomain hinge-loop region (M-site). The other resides in the Ddomain, constructed by either four conserved cysteines near the
C terminus (C-site) or residues at the surface of the D-domain
pointing toward the hinge region (D-site). Structural comparison
between inactive apo- and metallated active forms of BsPerR
suggested that regulatory metal binding causes DB-domains to
swing around the hinge region with respect to the D-domain, from
an open (swung-out) to closed (converged) conformations (22–
24). This process leads to a model that the rearrangement of DBdomains by binding a regulatory metal in the hinge region is responsible for the allosteric transition of all Fur family regulators,
from the inactive open conformation to the active closed one (23).
In this respect, the presence of three metal (Zn) binding sites
determined from the structural study of MtZur (20) has been
hard to interpret. The reported structure assumes an open dimeric conformation inadequate for DNA-binding, despite zinc
occupation of the M-site in the hinge region. Here, we present
the active conformation of zinc-bound Zur that assumes the
closed conformation suitable for DNA-binding, on the basis of
the 2.4 Å resolution crystal structure of S. coelicolor Zur (ScZur).
Through mutational and functional studies, we reveal that ScZur
contains two regulatory metal sites (M- and D-sites) in addition
to one structural one (C-site). Functional role of two regulatory

Overall Structure of ScZur with a Closed Conformation. ScZur is
a homodimer with a modular architecture similar to previously
determined Fur-family members. DB-domain (residues 1–77)
with the winged helix motif consists of a three-helical bundle and
a two-stranded sheet (Fig. 1A, H1–H3 and S1–S2). The D-domain
(residues 86–145) has a three-stranded sheet (Fig. 1A, S3–S5)
with a long helix (Fig. 1A, H4) and a short 310 helix (Fig. 1A, H5)
on opposite edges of the sheet, respectively. In the dimeric
structure, two D-domains build up the dimeric core where two
three-stranded sheets from each D-domain are combined to form
a six-stranded intermolecular sheet. Two DB-domains are positioned below the dimeric core (Fig. 1A), generating the arch shape
of the dimeric ScZur.
The anomalous scattering from zinc was exploited to determine
the number and the position of zinc sites. There are three zincbinding sites in each monomer of ScZur; site 1 (M), site 2 (C), and
site 3 (D) (Fig. 1B). Each site accommodates a zinc ion with the
tetrahedral geometry. The M-site at the domain interface is
formed by Asp65 from the DB-domain (S1), Cys79 and His85
from the hinge loop, and His87 from the D-domain (S3). The Csite is constructed by four cysteines (Cys90, Cys93, Cys130, and
Cys133) at one end of the D-domain. The D-site is located at the
other end of the D-domain, where His84, His86, Glu105, and
His122 participate in zinc coordination.
Effect of Mutations in Sporulation of S. coelicolor. To ﬁnd the contribution of various residues, especially metal-coordinating ones
identiﬁed by the crystal structures of ScZur and other Fur family
members, we made substitution mutants of ScZur. Cysteine residues were changed to serines, and others were changed to alanines to create variants such as E28A, F29A, R30A, H36A, H41A,
D65A, R68A, E71A, R77A, C79S, H84A, H85A, H86A, H87A,
C90S, C93S, E98A, E105A, H115A, H122A, C130S, and C133S.
The position of 22 mutated residues was presented in the 3D
structure (Fig. 2A) and in the primary sequence of ScZur aligned
with other Fur family members (SI Appendix, Fig. S1).
In contrast to wild-type S. coelicolor, which forms gray-green
spores on soya ﬂour mannitol (SFM) plates, the Δzur mutant did not
sporulate, forming only aerial mycelia of a white puffy appearance.
This phenotype has been proposed to result partly from overexpression of a Zur target gene SCO7682, encoding a putative zincophore called coelibactin (13, 14). When the wild-type zur gene was
introduced to Δzur on a pSET162-based vector, it enabled sporulation, restoring gray-green colors of the colony (Fig. 2B, WT). We
used this complementation analysis as a way to judge functionality of
Zur in S. coelicolor. Introduction of various mutant genes revealed
that some mutations did not restore sporulation, suggesting that they
lost functionality with respect to sporulation and possibly SCO7682
regulation. The nonfunctional mutations were F29A, R77A, C79S,
H85A, H87A, C90S, C93S, C130S, and C133S, retaining white colors

of the colonies. The other mutations appeared as nearly functional as
the wild-type gene, showing light to deep gray-green colors. The
nonfunctional mutations all resided at the C- or M-site, except for
F29A and R77A, which are at the interdomain interface and thus
very likely to affect domain arrangement.
Effect of ScZur Mutations on Target-Gene Expression. We then
monitored the effect of mutations on the expression of three
target genes of Zur. Transcripts from the znuA gene, encoding
a component of zinc-uptake system, rpmG2, encoding a zinc-less
paralog of ribosomal protein L33, and SCO7682, encoding coelibactin, were analyzed by S1 mapping. Fig. 3 shows representative
results for three genes, indicated with average values obtained
from three independent experiments. (The quantiﬁed data with
SDs was presented in SI Appendix, Fig. S2.) The three genes were
all derepressed in an Δzur mutant by 14-, 29-, and 33-fold, relative
to the wild-type. Introduction of a wild-type zur gene to the Δzur
mutant successfully repressed all gene expression. To our surprise, however, the effect of each mutation on repressing target
genes was varied, depending on targets. The znuA gene expression
was affected very sensitively by mutations, whereas rpmG2 and
SCO7682 were affected less sensitively. For example, 15 mutations affected znuA expression by more than twofold, whereas 8 or
9 mutations affected rpmG2 or SCO7682 by more than twofold. In
other words, transcription from the znuA gene responded more
sensitively to changes in Zur than did the other two genes.
We categorized the mutations into three or four groups based
on the extent of their effect. The critical residues that abolished
Zur activity to derepress all three genes by more than 10-fold are
Cys79 and Cys90, which constitute the C-site. Important residues
that affected Zur activity in all three genes by more than twofold
are Phe29, Arg77, His85, His87, Cys93, and Cys130. Cys133
mutation affected two genes. The rest (His36, Asp65, His84,
His86, Glu98, and Glu105) affected only the znuA expression,
implying that they serve a more subtle role in modulating Zur
activity. Interestingly, the critical and important residues that
affected all three genes constitute the M- or C-site, except Phe29
and Arg77, whereas the subtly modulating residues are at the Dsite (His84, His86, Glu105), near the M-site (Glu98), or in the
DB-domain (His36, Asp65). The effect of each residue on the
function of Zur to enable sporulation and transcriptional regulation is summarized in SI Appendix, Table S2. The residues that
affected all three genes also affected spore-formation.
Role of Each Metal-Binding Site. To delineate the role of each
metal-binding site in forming an active Zur structure, we performed biochemical and spectroscopic analyses of wild-type and
mutant Zur proteins. The C79S, C90S, and H84A mutants were
examined as representatives of M-, C-, and D-site mutations, respectively. Gel permeation chromatography through a Superdex
75 column indicated that C90S variant does not form dimers,
whereas others do (12) (SI Appendix, Fig. S3). Electrophoresis on
SDS/PAGE also demonstrated that C90S variant does not form
dimers (Fig. 4A). Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed that

22 mutated residues are indicated as small spheres in 3D structure of ScZur

1 × 105 spores of M145 (wild-type) and various Zur variant strains were
streaked on SFM. Photos were taken at 7 d after inoculation. Mutants that
do not restore sporulation remained white (underlined).

both the C79S and H84A mutants gave nearly identical spectra as
the wild-type, whereas the C90S mutant gave a remarkably different spectrum (SI Appendix, Fig. S4). All these results indicate
that the C90S mutation caused signiﬁcant changes in secondary
structure, consistent with the loss of dimerization. Therefore, zinc
binding to the C-site serves a structural role. We then measured
the metal content of various Zur preparations by inductively
coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (SI Appendix, Table S3). The average stoichiometry of zinc per monomeric Zur
was 2.4 for the wild-type, 1.5 for H84A, 1.0 for C79S, 0.25 for
C90S, and 1.2 for EDTA-treated apo-Zur. The observed amounts
of zinc support the presence of more than two zinc-binding sites,
structural importance of the C-site, and the more subtle role of
the D-site compared with the M-site.
We then measured the ability of each Zur variant to bind different target promoter probes by EMSA. In addition to the three
genes examined above, a probe for rpmF2 that encodes a paralogue of ribosomal protein L32 was included in this assay. Plotting
of the autoradiographic gel data (SI Appendix, Fig. S5) revealed
characteristic binding curves (Fig. 4 B–D). The apparent binding
afﬁnity (KD) of the wild-type, presented as the concentration of
Zur at 50% up-shift of DNA probes, was stronger for rpmG2 and
SCO7682 (17.7 and 17.6 nM) than for znuA and rpmF2 (74.9 and
68.3 nM) (Fig. 4B and SI Appendix, Fig. S5). The difference in
DNA binding afﬁnity parallels the differential sensitivity of gene
expression to mutations in vivo (Fig. 3). The C79S mutation nearly
abolished DNA binding to all promoters. On the other hand, the
H84A mutation reduced DNA binding afﬁnities of all promoters
in the order of rpmF2 (by 61-fold), SCO7682 (19-fold), znuA (11fold), and rpmG2 (7-fold). The sensitive promoter rpmF2 was
affected most, whereas the less sensitive promoter rpmG2 was
affected least. The results suggest that the H84A mutation can
also affect the nearby M-site, but they clearly reveal the potential

of modulating the D-site to achieve differential induction of
target genes.
Differential Expression of Zur Target Genes on Zinc Depletion. We
then explored whether each target gene responds to different
concentrations of zinc. For this purpose, we treated cells with [N,
N,N′,N′-Tetrakis-(2-pyridylmethyl) ethylenediamine] (TPEN),
a potent zinc-chelator, at varying concentrations for 5 min, and
analyzed transcripts by S1 mapping. The results in Fig. 5A
demonstrate that znuA and rpmF2 genes are induced at lower
TPEN, reaching nearly full induction at 4 μM TPEN with about
93% of the maximal level at 50 μM treatment. In contrast,
rpmG2 and SCO7682 genes responded less sensitively to TPEN,
with about 28% and 22% of full induction, respectively, at 4 μM
TPEN. Even at 50 μM TPEN, 5-min incubation allowed only
65% and 48% of induction at 40 min, respectively. This differential zinc-dependent induction pattern echoes the differential
sensitivity of promoters toward Zur mutations. We then examined the effect of TPEN on Zur-DNA binding in vitro. EMSA
analysis revealed that Zur-DNA complexes on znuA and rpmF2
promoters dissociated at lower TPEN (1.5–2 μM at 50% dissociation) than those on rpmG2 and SCO7682 (5.6 μM TPEN)
(Fig. 5 B and C). The EMSA results coincide with a differential
gene-expression pattern in vivo, indicating that graded modulation of Zur activity by zinc lies behind differential expression of
its targets.
Activation of Promoter-Binding Activities of Zur Occurs at Two Different Zinc Concentrations in Vitro. We then tried to estimate the

zinc concentration ranges that Zur senses to regulate different
genes. For this purpose, we determined the concentration of
added zinc that conferred DNA-binding activity to apo-Zur that
lacks regulatory metals because of EDTA treatment (SI Appendix,
Table S3). DNA-binding curves were obtained for each promoter
as a function of added ZnSO4 in the presence of a metal buffer
TPEN, as described by Outten and O’Halloran (4). Fig. 6 demonstrates clearly that binding to the two sets of promoters occurred at different zinc concentration ranges. Zur bound to the
sensitive genes (znuA, rpmF2) at higher zinc (∼3.8 μM at 50%
binding) than to the others (at ∼3.2 μM). In the presence of 5 μM
TPEN, these values correspond to free-zinc concentrations of
7.8 × 10−16 M and 4.5 × 10−16 M, respectively, reﬂecting two
different binding afﬁnities to Zur (4) (www.stanford.edu/∼cpatton/
webmaxc/webmaxcS.htm). These values are comparable with the
value (∼0.2 fM) observed for E. coli Zur (4). However, it is evident in
this study that ScZur responds to at least two different concentration
ranges, albeit not drastically apart.
Discussion
Regulatory Role of M- and D-sites in Zur. Through mutation studies,
we demonstrated that zinc binding to the C-site ensures dimeric
structural integrity of Zur. This observation coincides with previous reports that zinc binding ensures dimeric structure for Fur
from E. coli (25, 26) and that the Cys4-Zn site, which corresponds to the C-site, is critically required to maintain dimeric

structure of BsPerR and Fur from Helicobacter pylori (HpFur)
(27, 28). On the other hand, mutations at M- and D-sites did not
affect dimerization as well as the characteristics of secondary
structure. Therefore, it can be safely assumed that both M- and
D-sites serve regulatory roles to modulate Zur activity. D-site
occupation has been observed in PaFur (18) and VcFur (19). In
these iron-responsive Fur proteins, the conserved C-terminal
cysteines are lacking, and metals were found to occupy M- and
D-sites. Because D-sites are occupied by zinc and M-sites can
accommodate iron, the D-site in these proteins is regarded to
serve a structural role. On the other hand, a recent report on the
structure of active zinc-bound variant of HpFur, which contains
C-terminal cysteines, revealed the occupation of the D-site in
addition to M- and C-sites (29). In this structure, the D-site
metallation has been proposed to be nonessential for DNAbinding, but to serve a secondary role to modulate binding afﬁnity, consistent with what we discovered in the present study.
Although the domain structures of ScZur are virtually identical to those of MtZur, a remarkable difference exists between

dimeric conformations of the two structures. ScZur assumes an
arch-shaped DNA binding-competent closed conformation,
whereas MtZur is reported to assume an inactive open conformation (20). In this context, the difference in metal content at
the D-site between the two Zur proteins attracts our attention.
According to the structural report of MtZur, a zinc ion at the Dsite was reﬁned with a low occupancy because of an initially high
temperature factor (20). In contrast, the temperature factor and
the occupancy of a zinc ion at the D-site in ScZur are comparable to those of coordinating residues, clearly indicating the
presence of a zinc ion at the D-site. The fact that His84 in the
hinge loop participates in metal coordination at the D-site (Fig.
1A) suggests that metal-binding to this site may affect the metalinduced swing motion of the DB-domain.
Based on our observations, we postulate a simpliﬁed model for
modulating Zur activity through two regulatory zinc sites. Zinc
binding to the M-site at the interdomain hinge loop activates Zur
to bind its targets. Because the M-site has been revealed to accommodate various divalent cations, such as zinc, nickel, man-

ganese, and iron, in diverse active Fur family members (18, 19,
22, 23), it ﬁts the previously proposed activation model (23).
Without M-site occupation, Zur cannot bind and repress any of
its target genes, causes disturbance in zinc homeostasis, and
affects sporulation, most likely because of elevated synthesis of
coelibactin (13). Nevertheless, it appears that M-site occupation
may not be sufﬁcient to guarantee binding to all target genes of
Zur. The in vivo and in vitro observations that the D-site mutations affected target genes differently and that a higher amount
of zinc was needed to allow Zur to bind to the more sensitive
promoters (znuA and rpmF2) can be interpreted to imply that
additional zinc binding to the D-site is needed to repress some
targets, such as the sensitive group of genes. Therefore, in this
model, the M- and D-sites can serve as an on-off switch and
a tuner, respectively, for activity modulation. However, considering that Zur binds to its target sites with different afﬁnity and
that the presence of bound DNA can affect zinc-binding afﬁnity of Zur, the more sensitive induction of a subset of genes upon
smaller zinc depletion can be speculated to arise also from
the weaker afﬁnity of sensitive promoters to Zur. Even though
the precise mechanism is currently beyond our understanding,
the combined effect of two regulatory metal-binding sites and
differential DNA-binding afﬁnity of Zur seems to be behind the
scenes. Even though we formulated the model based on negatively regulated target genes of Zur as a repressor, it can also be
applied for positively regulated genes by Zur as an activator. No
such gene has been reported yet in S. coelicolor, but we expect
these genes exist, considering the example of positively regulated
zinc-exporter gene by Zur in Xanthomonas (15).
Graded Expression of Metal-Sensitive Genes in Accordance with
Metal Availability. The sensitive induction of a ZnuACB zinc

transporter system and the ribosomal L32 paralog ahead of L33
paralog and coelibactin reﬂects the presence of a graded expression of metal-responsive genes in accordance with metal
availability. The concentration range of free zinc, over which
ScZur responds to modulate transcription of the four studied
genes, spans from around 0.78 to 0.45 fM. Even though this is
not a wide range, our ﬁnding clearly demonstrates that Zur
differentially regulates its regulon members depending on the
amount of available zinc. In E. coli, Zur responds to ∼0.2 fM of
free zinc to regulate the zinc uptake gene (znuC), whereas ZntR
responds to ∼1.2 fM zinc to regulate the zinc export gene (zntA)
(4). This ﬁnding gives an idea about the range of free intracellular zinc over which E. coli responds to modulate its zincShin et al.

Materials and Methods
Bacterial Strains and Culture Conditions. S. coelicolor strains M145 (wild-type),
Δzur, or Δzur with chromosomally integrated zur gene (wild-type or sitespeciﬁc mutant), were routinely grown in YEME liquid media with 10.3%
sucrose (36). To cause zinc-depletion, various concentrations of TPEN were
added at 2 to 50 μM (ﬁnal) to exponentially growing cells in YEME for 5 or
40 min. For surface culture and to obtain spores, SFM media was used (36).
For Δzur mutants, which scarcely form spores, 30 SFM plates were grown to
obtain about 5 × 108 spores, whereas only one SFM plate was sufﬁcient to
obtain 1 × 109 spores for wild-type strains. For PCR-targeted mutagenesis, E.
coli BW25113 with pIJ790 plasmid were used as recommended (37). E. coli
ET12567 with pUZ8002 plasmid were used for conjugal transfer (38).
Preparation of ScZur Proteins. Wild-type, C79S, C90S, and H84A mutant Zur
proteins were puriﬁed from E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells containing pET3a-based
recombinant plasmid, as previously described, with some modiﬁcations (12).
EDTA was omitted in the buffer, except for preparing apo-Zur (SI Appendix).
For gel electrophoresis to detect oligomerization status, samples of 7 μg each
of puriﬁed Zur protein were used. Proteins boiled at 95 °C were mixed with
the same amount of nonboiled proteins before 13% SDS/PAGE at 80 V (39).
Crystallization, Structure Determination, and Reﬁnement. Crystals were obtained at 23 °C by the batch crystallization method with mother liquors of
15% PEG 3350 (wt/vol), 0.1 M magnesium formate, 0.1 M Bis-Tris (pH 6.5),
and 0.8 mM CHAPSO. The crystals belonged to the space group C2 with cell
parameters a = 103.6, b = 36.98, c = 71.65 Å, and β = 103.26°. For data collection, crystals were frozen at −170 °C after a brief immersion in a cryoprotectant solution containing 15% ethylene glycol in the same mother
liquor. A 2.4 Å dataset (SI Appendix, Table S1) was collected at beamline 17A
at Photon Factory. The model building was performed using COOT and reﬁnement was done with a maximum-likelihood algorithm implemented in
CNS (SI Appendix, Table S1). The structure was determined by molecular
replacement using MolRep in the CCP4 program suite. Structures of DB- and
D-domains in MtZur were separately used as search models. That is, two
independent models were used to obtain phasing information. Several

Fig. 6. Concentration ranges of zinc that activate Zur binding to different
promoters. Each promoter DNA probe was incubated with EDTA-treated
apo-Zur in the presence of varying amounts of ZnSO4 (0–5 μM) and 5 μM
TPEN in the binding buffer for 1 h. Following EMSA (SI Appendix, Fig. S6),
the percent of bound DNA was plotted against added zinc, and the data
were ﬁt to the Hill equation. Average values with SDs were obtained from
six independent experiments. The micromolar concentrations of ZnSO4 at
50% binding were 3.83 ± 0.14 for znuA, 3.81 ± 0.16 for rpmF2, 3.25 ± 0.20
for rpmG2, and 3.26 ± 0.18 for SCO7682. The calculated concentration of
free zinc was indicated in fentomolar on the parallel x axis.

responsive factors. In S. coelicolor, no zinc export system has yet
been reported, even though genome sequence predicts sequence
homologs of ZntA, ZntR, and several P-type ATPases. Future
studies on zinc-speciﬁc export systems and their regulators will
provide complementing information on the range of zinc over
which this organism responds to control transcription.
Behind the differential sensitivity of promoters to Zur activity
modulation by zinc lie the differences in Zur-binding afﬁnities of
the two groups of promoters (Fig. 4B). We tried to ﬁnd any characteristic sequence information in the promoter region, such as the
number of and sequence similarity to consensus Zur-box (SI Appendix, Fig S7). No obvious sequence patterns correlated with
binding afﬁnities. Expression of different tiers of genes has been
observed in a number of stress responses in response to the extent
of stressors, such as heat and oxidants. However, in most cases the
modulation is mediated by different sensor-regulators that detect
different range or intensity of stimuli. For example, in E. coli, where
heat-shock response is primarily mediated by a heat-shock σ factor
RpoH (σ32), heat at 42 °C increases the amount of RpoH to govern
heat response, whereas extreme heat at around 50 °C requires an
additional heat shock factor RpoE (σ24) (30–32). In ﬁssion yeast
Schizosaccharomyces pombe, responses to low and high levels of
peroxide are modulated by Pap1 and Atf1, respectively (33). Differential activation of target genes by a single regulator (Zap1) in
response to zinc deﬁciency has been reported in Saccharomyces
cerevisiae (34), where the elucidation of an underlying mechanism is
awaited. Activity modulation through two regulatory metal-binding
sites in Zur extends the versatility of this regulator to allow graded
expression of target genes in response to expanded concentration
ranges of zinc. This mechanism will be beneﬁcial for bacteria in all
zinc-limiting environments, including those in animal hosts where
zinc depletion is exploited as a defense mechanism against invading
pathogens (35). There also remains a possibility that a similar
principle abides in other metalloregulators, waiting to be examined.

rounds of reﬁnement and remodeling produced a ﬁnal model reﬁned to R
and Rfree values to 21.4% and 24.9%, respectively.
Site-Speciﬁc Mutagenesis of zur and Introduction to Δzur Cells. The template
plasmid containing the entire coding region of zur was constructed in pGEMTeasy vector (Promega), resulting in pSJ703. Site-speciﬁc mutagenesis was
done with QuixChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Twenty-two pairs of
mutagenic primers were synthesized to change codons for cysteines to serines, and other amino acids to alanines. The mutated genes were veriﬁed by
DNA sequencing, and recloned into pET3a (for pSJ704 series) and pSET162
(a derivative of pSET151, for pSJ705 series) plasmids for in vitro and in vivo
studies, respectively. The ﬁnal clones were conﬁrmed again by DNA sequencing. The pSET162-based recombinant plasmids were introduced into
Δzur mutant of S. coelicolor by conjugal transfer, and the correct exconjugants were selected on antibiotics plates according to standard procedures
(36). Each representative conjugant was isolated from a single colony, and
conﬁrmed by nucleotide sequencing of PCR products.

S1-Mapping Analysis. RNA samples were prepared from wild-type and Δzur cells
harboring chromosomally integrated copies of wild-type and mutated zur
genes. Preparation of RNA, PCR ampliﬁcation of gene-speciﬁc probes, radiolabeling of 5′ ends by 32P, and S1-mapping analysis were done as described
previously (12) and in the SI Appendix. Quantiﬁcation of S1-protected bands
was done through phosphor screen and image analyzer (FLA-2000; Fuji).

ends with [γ-32P] ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. The binding reaction
was carried out by incubating ∼3.07 fmol of labeled DNA with varying
amounts (6.8 fmol ∼27.84 pmol) of puriﬁed Zur proteins as isolated in 20 μL
of binding reaction buffer [20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 50 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT,
0.1 mg of BSA/mL, 5% glycerol, 0.1 μg of poly (dI-dC)] for 1 h at room
temperature. For zinc-depletion experiments, further incubation with TPEN
(up to 25 μM, 30 min) was carried out, followed by gel electrophoresis (12).
For zinc-addition experiments, DNA probes were preincubated in binding
reaction buffer with added ZnSO4 (up to 5 μM) and 5 μM TPEN for 30 min
before adding EDTA-treated apo-Zur (170 nM), followed by further incubation (1 h) and electrophoresis. The dried gels were exposed and quantiﬁed by a phosphorimage analyzer (BAS-2500; Fujiﬁlm). We combined
signals from all shifted bands for obtaining bound fraction, and the nonshifted band for nonbound fraction. Digitalized data were ﬁt to binding
curves through SigmaPlot 2001 program (SPSS Inc.). Apparent KD values,
corresponding to the concentration of variables (Zur, TPEN, or ZnSO4) at
half-maximal upshift of DNA probes, were determined from at least three
independent sets of experiments.

Zur-DNA Binding Analysis-EMSA. Each promoter DNA probe of ∼100 bp
containing Zur binding sites was prepared by PCR, using primer pairs as
detailed in SI Appendix, Fig. S7. Puriﬁed PCR products were labeled at 5′
