P

roteins of the AAA+ superfamily (ATPases Associated with
diverse cellular Activities) are highly ubiquitous and found
in all kingdoms of life. These proteins are characterized by the
structural conservation of a central ATPase domain of about 250
amino acids called the AAA+ module (1, 2). AAA+ ATPases
employ the energy derived from ATP hydrolysis to remodel
proteins, DNA, or RNA. Typically, the AAA+ domain can be
divided into two structural subdomains, an N-terminal P-loop
NTPase αβα subdomain that is connected to a smaller C-terminal
all-α subdomain. The αβα subdomain adopts a Rossman fold and
contains several motifs involved in ATP binding and hydrolysis,
including Walker A, Walker B, and Sensor 1 signature sequences
(3–6). The all-α subdomain, which contains the Sensor 2 motif
(7), is much less conserved across AAA+ proteins.
AAA+ proteins form oligomers, usually hexameric rings, in
the presence of nucleotides (8). The ATP-binding pocket is located at the interface between two neighboring subunits. A highly
conserved arginine from one subunit, called an “arginine finger,”
contacts the γ-phosphate of bound ATP of the neighboring subunit (9). AAA+ proteins typically go through a cycle of ATP binding, hydrolysis, and release of products. This reaction cycle results
in a series of conformational changes and mechanical movements
that allow these proteins to exert their activity either directly or
through domains attached to the AAA+ domain (3, 10).
The RavA protein (Regulatory ATPase Variant A) belongs to
the MoxR AAA+ family (11). Limited experimental data suggest
a function of MoxR AAA+ proteins as chaperones in the assembly of multimeric complexes and a possible role in small molecule
cofactor insertion/removal (11). However, how these proteins act
is not clear. In Escherichia coli, the ravA gene is in an operon with
another gene of unknown function, which we termed viaA, and
the operon is under the control of σ S promoter, suggesting a function of RavA and ViaA under stress conditions (12). This is
www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1009092107

further substantiated by our discovery that RavA physically interacts with the inducible lysine decarboxylase enzyme, LdcI/CadA,
a key enzyme in the bacterial acid stress response. We have visualized the LdcI-RavA complex by negative staining electron microscopy and found it to form a large, about 3.3 MDa, unusual cagelike structure consisting of two LdcI decamers that are linked by
up to five RavA hexamers (12). Because LdcI is fivefold symmetric whereas RavA is sixfold symmetric, understanding the construction of this complex is important to understanding how the
symmetry mismatch was used in forming the cage-like structure.
We recently solved the X-ray crystal structure of LdcI decamer
and unexpectedly found that LdcI activity is strongly inhibited
by the binding of the alarmone, ppGpp (further details on the
LdcI structure will be described elsewhere). Here, we have
determined the three-dimensional structure of RavA full-length
protein as a monomer in complex with ADP by X-ray crystallography. Insights into the intersubunit organization of the hexameric
RavA were obtained from electron microscopy. These structures
provided important insights into how nature solved the symmetry
mismatch problem between the fivefold symmetric LdcI decamer
and sixfold symmetric RavA hexamer to allow for the construction
of the RavA-LdcI molecular cage-like structure. We show that
the RavA-LdcI interaction reduces the inhibition of LdcI activity
by the alarmone ppGpp in vitro as well as in vivo. The biological
implications of this interaction are discussed.

The MoxR family of AAA+ ATPases is widespread throughout bacteria and archaea but remains poorly characterized. We recently
found that the Escherichia coli MoxR protein, RavA (Regulatory
ATPase variant A), tightly interacts with the inducible lysine decarboxylase, LdcI/CadA, to form a unique cage-like structure. Here, we
present the X-ray structure of RavA and show that the αβα and allα subdomains in the RavA AAA+ module are arranged as in magnesium chelatases rather than as in classical AAA+ proteins. RavA
structure also contains a discontinuous triple-helical domain as well
as a β-barrel-like domain forming a unique fold, which we termed
the LARA domain. The LARA domain was found to mediate the
interaction between RavA and LdcI. The RavA structure provides
insights into how five RavA hexamers interact with two LdcI decamers to form the RavA-LdcI cage-like structure.

438–441 (Fig. 1A), are missing in the final electron density map
and are indicated by dotted lines in Fig. 1B.
The RavA monomer has a complex elongated overall structure
consisting of three distinct domains (Fig. 1 A and B). The N-terminal domain of RavA is the AAA+ module, which is composed
of two subdomains: the αβα subdomain (residues 1–192, brown)
and the all-α subdomain (residues 226–306, wheat). The αβα
subdomain exhibits a Rossmann-type fold commonly found in
nucleotide binding proteins. It consists of a central β-sheet with
five parallel β-strands, ordered as 51432, sandwiched between
seven α-helices. The all-α subdomain consists of four antiparallel
α-helices. The αβα subdomain and the all-α subdomain are linked
by a 32-residue helical segment (residues 193–225, green). The
relative arrangement of the subdomains is similar to that found
in Mg chelatases (discussed below).

and L391 from the α14 helix.

The second domain is a discontinuous triple-helical domain
formed by helices α13, α15, and α16 (residues 307–330 and
442–497, light blue). This domain has a rigid structure stabilized
by hydrophobic interactions localized at the interface between
the three helices. The third domain (residues 331–437, dark
blue), which we have named the LARA domain (for reasons
described below), is a protuberance between helices α13 and
α15 of the triple-helical domain. As shown in Fig. 1 B and C, the
LARA domain forms a compact antiparallel β-barrel-like structure consisting of six β-strands (β6–β11) and one α-helix (α14).
The LARA domain also includes an N-terminal flexible region
(residues D332–S360). The domain is very basic (pI of 9.6) resulting from a highly positively charged surface formed by residues
R340, R347, R348, R398, K400, K409, and R423 (Fig. 1C). We
performed an extensive search for structures similar to that of the
LARA domain in the Protein Data Bank using secondary-structure matching (SSM) (13) and Dali (14), but no such structures
were found. Hence, we conclude that the E. coli RavA LARA
domain adopts a unique fold.
The sequence conservation at the C terminus of RavA spanning the triple-helical and LARA domains diverges quite quickly,
although, according to secondary-structure prediction, all organisms containing RavA protein with a LARA domain also have a
triple-helical domain. It was surprising to find that a phenylalanine (F472), located at the turn between helices α15 and α16 of
the triple-helical domain, is absolutely conserved (Fig. S1A). This
phenylalanine makes hydrophobic contacts with the AAA+ module and, hence, anchors the triple-helical bundle to the AAA+
module (Fig. S1 B and C). F472 might serve to transmit the
nucleotide-dependent conformational changes in the AAA+
domain to the C-terminal triple-helical and LARA domains
of RavA.
RavA Hexameric Assembly. Although RavA and many other AAA+
ATPases crystallize as monomers, their functional form is well
known to be an oligomeric ring structure. Previous work in
our laboratory provided first evidence for a hexameric assembly
of RavA induced by ATP, ADP, or 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate (AMPPNP) binding (12). Here we present a 3D structure
of the RavA hexamer formed in the presence of ADP obtained by
negative staining electron microscopy (EM) and image analysis.
Similar to other AAA+ protein structures, hexameric RavAADP is characterized by a ring-shaped core surrounding a central
pore. Some representative class averages, as well as corresponding projections of the 3D structure at similar orientations, are
shown in Fig. 2A. The distinctive feature of the class averages
is the relatively weak density of the LARA domain, which necessitated a good alignment in order to be properly visualized (see
Materials and Methods for details). The RavA hexameric ring
forms a rather unique flower-like structure and is found to be
about 220 Å in diameter and of 80-Å thickness, whereas the diameter of the central channel is about 25 Å. The 3D reconstruction
possesses a prominent handedness, visible in the core AAA+ part
and notably accentuated by the protrusions. An atomic model of
the hexamer was then generated by docking the crystal structure
of the monomer into the EM density of the hexamer and adjustment of the resulting intersubunit contacts based on a homology
model generated from the hexameric crystal structure of HslU
[PDB ID code 1DO0 (15)] (see Materials and Methods and
Fig. S2 for details). The final EM reconstruction and the resulting
atomic model of the RavA-ADP hexamer are shown in Fig. 2B.
The Organization of the AAA+ Motor Subdomains. In their classification of AAA+ proteins, Aravind and coworkers grouped RavA
within the helix 2 insert clade (8). Members of this family are found
to have (i) an insert within helix 2 of the conserved ASCE (refers to
Additional Strand, Catalytic E) division P-loop ATPase core, (ii) a
β-hairpin N terminal to Sensor 1, as well as, (iii) a long helical segEl Bakkouri et al.

ment separating the C terminus of the αβα subdomain and the
N terminus of the all-α subdomain. The X-ray structure of the
RavA AAA+ module agrees with this classification. The αβα subdomain contains two characteristic β-hairpin insertions (Figs. 1A
and 2C). The helix-2 insert (H2-I, residues Pro85–Pro106) is incorporated within helix α4, but is partially unstructured in our
model (shown as a dotted line in Figs. 1B and 2C). In the case of
the Mg chelatase subunit BchI, this insert consists of two β-strands
flanking a small helix (16). The Pre-Sensor 1 β-Hairpin insertion
(PS1-βH, residues Gln135–Pro146) is incorporated between the
Sensor 1 strand (β4) and the preceding helix (α5). It has been
shown that PS1-βH and H2-I are usually important for substrate
interaction (17–20). The long helical segment between the αβα
and all-α subdomains is shown in green in Figs. 1 A and B and 2C;
this segment consists of two helices that wrap around the surface
of the αβα subdomain making several contacts with it.
SSM and Dali structural similarity searches using the whole
RavA AAA+ module indicated only four proteins to have similar
structures as the RavA AAA+ domain: the putative ATPase from
Cytophaga hutchinsonii, BchI subunit of Rhodobacter capsulatus
Mg chelatase, archaeal minichromosome maintenance protein
MCM from Sulfolobus solfataricus, and an archaeal MCM homolog from Methanopyrus kandleri (Fig. S3). In all of these proteins,
the spatial localization of the all-α subdomain relative to the αβα
subdomain is similar to that of RavA and is significantly different
El Bakkouri et al.

from its typical position found in most other AAA+ members
(8, 21).
Fig. 2C illustrates the differences between the AAA+ module
organization of HslU, a canonical model of the typical AAA+
module fold (15), and RavA AAA+ domain. In HslU, the all-α
subdomain is located on “top” of the αβα subdomain. In the all-α
subdomain, the Sensor 2 motif (shown in dark blue in Fig. 2C), a
required motif for nucleotide binding and hydrolysis, is oriented
toward the ATP-binding site of the same protomer. In the case
of RavA, the all-α subdomain is on the “right” of the αβα subdomain; consequently, the Sensor 2 motif cannot contribute to ATP
hydrolysis on the same protomer as in HslU. However, when the
X-ray structure of the HslU hexamer is compared to the RavA
hexameric model (Fig. 2D), then it is clear that HslU and RavA
share similar organization of the subdomains in the oligomer
although the orientation of the protomers is reversed. In the
RavA hexamer, the all-α subdomain of one protomer is located
on top of the αβα subdomain of the protomer on its right (Fig. 2 D
and E), and the Arg residue of Sensor 2 faces the ATP-binding
site of a neighboring protomer (Fig. 2E and Fig. S4). In the HslU
hexamer, the all-α subdomain of one protomer is located on top
of the αβα subdomain of the protomer on its left (Fig. 2 D and E),
and the Arg residue of Sensor 2 is facing the ATP-binding site of
the same protomer (Fig. 2E and Fig. S4). Hence, when viewed
from the top, the subunits in RavA are organized clockwise,

in our laboratory has shown that RavA interacts with LdcI, an
inducible lysine decarboxylase enzyme, forming an unusual cagelike complex of about 3.3 MDa consisting of two LdcI (81 kDa)
decamers and up to five RavA (56 kDa) hexamers (Fig. 3A) (12).
We further confirmed this interaction in this study. The pull-down
of RavA from an E. coli strain in which a Sequential Peptide Affinity (SPA) tag (22) was fused at the 3′ end of the endogenous
ravA gene, also pulled down LdcI as previously observed (12).
Analysis of the complex by size exclusion chromatography
showed that the majority of RavA was part of a 3.3-MDa complex
with LdcI (Fig. S5A), which corresponds to the mass of the complex shown in Fig. 3A. LdcI migrated as a complex with RavA but
also as uncomplexed decamers as well. In another experiment,
analysis of the interaction between purified RavA and LdcI
proteins by sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation
revealed the presence of 0.8-, 2.7-, and 6.0-MDa complexes
(Fig. S5B). These complexes would correspond to LdcI decamer
alone, the RavA-LdcI cage-like complex of Fig. 3A, and a dimer
of the cage-like complex, respectively.
Docking of RavA hexameric model of Fig. 2B and LdcI decameric crystal structure that we recently determined into the EM
envelope suggested that the LARA domain of RavA might interact with LdcI (Fig. 3A and Fig. S6A). To determine the validity of
the docking model, a RavA construct was made in which the
LARA domain was deleted and was termed RavAΔLARA (consisting of residues Met1–Ala335 and Leu434–Cys498). An isolated LARA domain construct was also generated (residues
Gln329–Glu440). Circular dichroism analysis showed that both
proteins have the expected secondary-structure content. Furthermore, RavAΔLARA formed a hexameric complex in the presence
of ATP (Fig. S6B), and its ATPase activity was similar to that of
WT RavA (Fig. S6B, Inset). The interaction of LdcI with RavA
and its different constructs was then assessed by surface plasmon
resonance (SPR) using the Biacore system. In these experiments,
LdcI was immobilized on the chip. The SPR experiments clearly
showed that, although WT RavA and LARA domain do interact
with LdcI (Fig. 3B), RavAΔLARA does not bind to LdcI (Fig. 3C).
In the absence of nucleotide, WT RavA bound LdcI with an
apparent binding constant of 0.56 μM (Fig. 3B). In the presence
of ATP, the binding curve was best fit using two independent
binding sites with apparent binding constants of 0.018 μM and
1.22 μM (Fig. 3B). This might indicate that the proper hexamerization of RavA, which is attained in the presence of ATP, allows
for two RavA“legs” to bind the LdcI decamer at two different sites
as suggested by the docking analysis of Fig. 3A and Fig. S6A. How-

whereas the subunits in HslU are organized counterclockwise
(Fig. 2D).
It should be noted that, in the RavA structure, the all-α and
αβα subdomains from the same monomer make extensive interactions. The buried surface area between these two subdomains is
much larger in the case of RavA (2;797 Å2 ) than for HslU monomer (1;084 Å2 ) (Fig. 2E). As a result, in the HslU hexamer, the
all-α subdomain makes more extensive interactions with the αβα
subdomain of the neighboring protomer (2;930 Å2 ) than in the
RavA hexamer (754 Å2 ).
Even with these major differences in the assembly of the
subunits, the overall structures of the RavA and HslU AAA+ hexamers remain similar with a high conservation in the organization
of the ATP-binding site. Fig. S4 shows the localization of the
nucleotide between two subunits of the RavA and HslU hexamers.
In both cases, the nucleotide makes contact with three subdomains. For HslU, the nucleotide is sandwiched between the αβα
and the all-α subdomains of the same subunit and faces the αβα
subdomain of the left neighboring subunit, whereas the nucleotide
in RavA contacts the αβα subdomain of one subunit and faces the
all-α and the αβα subdomains of the left neighboring subunit.

ever, it should be noted that, because of the experimental setup,
the full complex shown in Fig. 3A, in which RavA hexamers can
bridge two LdcI decamers, is unlikely to form under the conditions
of the SPR experiments because LdcI is cross-linked to the chip.
The isolated LARA domain is also able to bind LdcI albeit with
a lower apparent K d of 54 μM (Fig. 3B). Hence, these observations
strongly suggest that the LARA domain is the RavA domain
required for LdcI interaction, hence the acronym LARA: LdcI
associating domain of RavA.
Bioinformatic analysis provided further support for the finding
that the LARA domain mediates the interaction of RavA with
LdcI. In 47 representative bacterial strains that contained RavA
based on BLAST searches (23), we asked whether these strains
also contain LdcI. As mentioned earlier, the C-terminal fragment
of RavA including the triple-helical bundle and LARA domain is
not well conserved. Hence, the presence of the LARA domain in
RavA across the different strains was assessed using JPred secEl Bakkouri et al.

our prior observations (12). However, when ppGpp is added to
the preformed RavA-LdcI complex, the presence of RavA reduces the inhibitory effect of ppGpp on LdcI by about 40% under
the conditions of the experiment (Fig. 4B). Moreover, the RavAΔLARA truncation mutant is not able to reduce the inhibitory
effect of ppGpp on LdcI activity, which is consistent with our
results showing that the LARA domain is responsible for the
RavA-LdcI interaction. When LdcI is preincubated with ppGpp
and then RavA is added, RavA is not able to reduce the inhibition
of LdcI by the alarmone (Fig. 4C). Hence, RavA either blocks the
access to the ppGpp binding site in LdcI or RavA induces a local
conformational change in LdcI that reduces its ppGpp binding
affinity. Alternatively, ppGpp might cause a conformational
change in LdcI to reduce RavA binding to the decarboxylase.
It should be pointed out that the effect of RavA on LdcI inhibition by ppGpp is probably underestimated because these experiments were done at low concentrations of MgCl2 . Under such
conditions, RavA has low ATPase activity; addition of higher concentrations of MgCl2 lead to the precipitation of ppGpp by Mg2þ .
To further validate our in vitro results and to determine if the
modulation of ppGpp binding to LdcI by RavA can be observed
in vivo, the activity of LdcI was tested in different strains undergoing a stringent response. Four strains were used: ΔcadBA, WT
+ ravA, WT + ravAΔLARA, and WT + ravA(K52Q). The last
three strains overexpress RavA, RavAΔLARA, and RavA
(K52Q) proteins by IPTG induction (refer to Materials and Methods). RavA(K52Q) is ATPase deficient because the conserved
Walker A K52 is mutated to Q (Fig. 1A). Endogenous RavA
is expressed at low levels and is induced only in the stationary
phase (12). Cells were grown to log phase in defined rich media
buffered at pH 5, and, when the OD600 of each strain was approximately 0.2, proteins were induced with 1 mM IPTG for 1 h. Cells
were then shifted to minimal media weakly buffered at pH 5
containing no amino acids to induce ppGpp production, and
supplemented with 30 mM lysine to follow the LdcI activity by
monitoring pH change of the media; no cell growth occurs during

ondary structure prediction program (24). It was interesting to
find that RavA in all strains containing LdcI has a LARA domain,
whereas strains that do not have LdcI contain RavA that has or
does not have the LARA domain (Fig. S6C). The LARA domain
in these strains might have other functions or the domain will
eventually degenerate.

RavA Antagonizes the Inhibitory Effect of ppGpp on LdcI Activity. The
LdcI crystal structure revealed the presence of a binding site for
the bacterial alarmone guanosine tetraphosphate (ppGpp) at the
interface between two protomers in the pentameric ring (Fig. 3A).
Biochemical assays showed that ppGpp binding to LdcI results in
drastic inhibition of the LdcI activity of approximately 10-fold at
pH values greater than 5. The docking shown in Fig. 3A suggests
that the LARA domain of RavA might bind at a site in LdcI that
could affect ppGpp binding to the decarboxylase.
The activity of the decarboxylase was measured in the presence
and absence of RavA and ppGpp using an isothermal titration
calorimetry (ITC) approach. Initially, we ensured that the presence of GTP, GDP, ppGpp, and pppGpp does not affect RavA
ATPase activity (Fig. 4A). When the RavA-LdcI complex is preformed, LdcI activity is not significantly changed consistent with

The LARA Domain Mediates RavA-RavA Interactions. The docking
shown in Fig. 3A suggests that the LARA domain might also mediate RavA-RavA interactions within the RavA-LdcI cage-like
complex by interacting with the triple-helical domain and/or the
LARA domain of the neighboring RavA (Fig. S6A). SPR experiments were carried out in which RavA or RavAΔLARA is immobilized on the chip and the LARA domain is titrated. The results
indicate that the LARA domain can bind to RavA with an apparent K d of about 0.5 μM (Fig. 3D). This interaction is drastically
reduced when the binding experiment is performed between
RavAΔLARA and the LARA domain (Fig. 3D), suggesting that
the LARA domain plays an important role in RavA-RavA interactions within the RavA-LdcI cage-like complex.

this time (Fig. 4D and Fig. S7). Consistent with the in vitro results,
WT + ravA strain increased the pH of the media at a higher rate
than the WT + ravAΔLARA strain, whereas no significant pH
change was observed for the ΔcadBA cells (Fig. 4D). Hence, the
formation of the RavA-LdcI complex reduced the inhibitory
effect of the alarmone on LdcI, allowing the cells to better
respond to low acidity. On the other hand, RavAΔLARA cannot
form a complex with LdcI (Fig. 3D) and, hence, LdcI should still
be inhibited by ppGpp resulting in a lower rate of pH increase,
as observed (Fig. 4D). The strain overexpressing RavA(K52Q)
mutant increased pH faster than the strain overexpressing RavAΔLARA, but not as well as the strain overexpressing WT RavA
(Fig. 4D), indicating that the binding of RavA to LdcI is not
enough to modulate alarmone binding to the decarboxylase, but
that the ATPase activity of RavA is also needed.
Discussion
The organization of the AAA+ module of RavA as revealed
by the X-ray structure of the protein (Figs. 1B and 2C) explicitly
demonstrates that the protein is closely related to the family of
Mg chelatases. We had previously found that RavA and LdcI interact tightly to form an unusual cage-like structure (12). Having
the X-ray structure and the EM reconstruction of RavA (this
study), as well as the X-ray structure of LdcI and the negative
staining EM reconstruction of the RavA-LdcI complex (12),
allowed us to gain important insights into the design principles
of this cage that is formed by the interaction of a fivefold symmetric oligomer of LdcI with a sixfold symmetric oligomer of
RavA (Fig. 3A). The RavA hexamer displays six “legs,” which
are spanning the triple-helical domain and the LARA domain.
Two of the legs interact with an LdcI dimer at the top of the complex, and two other legs show the same set of interactions with an
LdcI dimer at the bottom of the complex. These interactions
seem to be mainly mediated by the LARA domain. The two
remaining legs of RavA are interacting with a neighboring
RavA leg on the left and on the right (Fig. 3A and Fig. S6A). The
RavA-RavA leg–leg interactions seem to involve the triple-helical
domain, as well as the LARA domain (Fig. 3A). Hence, the construction of the RavA leg makes all these interactions possible.
The LARA domain exhibits a unique fold and, based on the
bioinformatic analysis of Fig. S6C, seems to be optimally evolved
to mediate the interaction of RavA with LdcI.

The RavA-LdcI cage-like structure might have multiple functions in the cell yet to be elucidated; however, one consequence
we found here for the formation of the RavA-LdcI complex is the
reduction of the inhibitory effect of ppGpp on LdcI activity.
When cells are undergoing acid stress and LdcI is induced to
about 2,000 decamers per cell, nutrient limitation will result in
the production of the alarmone. Because we estimate that there
are about 50–100 RavA hexamers per cell in the stationary phase
(12), only a small population of LdcI molecules is expected to be
in complex with RavA. This population of LdcI will not be
strongly inhibited by ppGpp, allowing the cells to continue to respond to acid stress at the risk of depleting lysine amounts. It is
interesting to note that RavA and ppGpp have similar binding
constants to LdcI: K d of 0.02—1 μM for RavA-LdcI interaction
(Fig. 3B) and K d of 0.01–0.7 μM for LdcI-ppGpp interaction. The
binding of RavA to apo-LdcI does not affect LdcI activity to any
significant extent (Fig. 4B and ref. 12). Hence, there is a fine-tuning of LdcI activity by ppGpp and RavA, which is required for the
cells to respond to acid stress, as well as to prevent the depletion
of their amino acids. This fine-tuning probably involves other factors and proteins and also occurs for other amino acid decarboxylases involved in the bacterial acid stress response.
