exameric helicases and translocases are motor proteins that
play a central role in cellular transactions ranging from
replication and repair to transcriptional regulation, chromosome
packaging, and proteolytic homeostasis (1–4). Used to drive the
processive and, at times, highly rapid movement of extended
nucleic acid or protein chains through a central pore, ring-shaped
motors face several challenges to their operation. One is that certain enzymes must transition through controlled ring opening
and/or subunit assembly events to allow long, polymeric substrates
that lack freely accessible ends to access interior motor elements (5–
7). Another is that, once loaded, the molecular plasticity inherent to
these assemblies must be harnessed to precisely coordinate ATP
binding and hydrolysis between multiple subunits with the powering of substrate translocation, while at the same time alternating between tight and loose grips on the substrate to allow for
processive movement. The substrate-dependent molecular rearrangements that underpin ring dynamics during these events remain poorly understood, not only for hexameric helicases and
translocases, but for related ring-shaped switches as well.
The Escherichia coli Rho transcription termination factor is
a well-established model system for understanding hexameric
translocase and helicase function (8, 9). During termination,
Rho uses a cytosine-specific RNA-binding domain appended to
the N terminus of a RecA-type ATPase fold (10, 11) to bind
nascent RNA transcripts at cytosine-rich sequences [known as
Rho utilization (rut) sites] (12, 13). Once loaded, Rho consumes
ATP to translocate 5′→3′ toward a paused RNA polymerase,
eventually promoting transcription bubble collapse and RNA
release (14–19).
Structural studies have provided insights into the mechanics of
RNA loading by Rho, imaging the helicase in both closed-circular and notched/lockwasher-shaped states (20–24). These
findings have suggested that Rho monomers assemble into a
www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1616745113

pliant hexamer that can spontaneously open to allow nucleic acid
entry into the translocation pore (22, 24, 25), a property that has
been observed in other hexameric helicases such as the eukaryotic MCM2-7 complex (26–28). By comparison, the structure of
a closed-ring Rho complex bound to single-stranded RNA and
the ATP-mimetic ADP·BeF3 has provided a picture of a prospective translocation intermediate of the motor (29). This work,
combined with that of a prior landmark model for the human
papillomavirus E1 helicase bound to single-stranded DNA
and ADP (30) [as well as more recent work on the replicative
helicase, DnaB (31)] has led to two general principles for understanding hexameric helicase function. One is that, as proposed first for the T7 gp4 protein (32), most hexameric helicases
likely use a sequential, rotary ATPase mechanism similar to that
used by the F1 ATPase to power translocation (33). Another is
that both the relative order of hydrolysis between subunits and/or
differences in subunit orientation within a motor can determine
the polarity of nucleic acid translocation (29, 30, 34, 35).
Despite present-day insights, there remain many unanswered
questions regarding the loading and translocation mechanism of
Rho. For example, there has been no systematic assessment of
the extent to which the various crystallographic states observed
thus far correlate with the predominant structures adopted by
Significance
Hexameric, ring-shaped translocases are molecular motors that
convert the chemical energy of ATP hydrolysis into the physical
movement of protein and nucleic acid substrates. Structural
studies of several distinct hexameric translocases have provided insights into how substrates are loaded and translocated;
however, the range of structural changes required for coupling
ATP turnover to a full cycle of substrate loading and translocation has not been visualized for any one system. Here, we
combine low- and high-resolution structural studies of the Rho
transcription termination factor, defining a set of conformational transitions that accompany substrate binding and
translocations by a processive hexameric helicase.

Ring-shaped hexameric helicases and translocases support essential
DNA-, RNA-, and protein-dependent transactions in all cells and
many viruses. How such systems coordinate ATPase activity between
multiple subunits to power conformational changes that drive the
engagement and movement of client substrates is a fundamental
question. Using the Escherichia coli Rho transcription termination
factor as a model system, we have used solution and crystallographic
structural methods to delineate the range of conformational changes
that accompany distinct substrate and nucleotide cofactor binding
events. Small-angle X-ray scattering data show that Rho preferentially adopts an open-ring state in solution and that RNA and ATP
are both required to cooperatively promote ring closure. Multiple
closed-ring structures with different RNA substrates and nucleotide
occupancies capture distinct catalytic intermediates accessed during
translocation. Our data reveal how RNA-induced ring closure templates a sequential ATP-hydrolysis mechanism, provide a molecular
rationale for how the Rho ATPase domains distinguishes between
distinct RNA sequences, and establish structural snapshots of substepping events in a hexameric helicase/translocase.

Rho in solution. The relative roles that ATP and RNA play in
promoting ring opening vs. ring closing are similarly unresolved.
At the same time, the range and types of movements that accompany ATP turnover events to support RNA translocation
have yet to be fully defined. Likewise, it is unclear how the
physical nature of the nucleic acid substrate itself—its chemical
identity and base composition—feeds back to ATPase centers to
influence motor activity. Answers to these questions are needed
to understand fundamental aspects of hexameric helicase loading and translocation, not just by Rho, but by hexameric motor
proteins in general.
To better define the physical basis by which substrate-coupled
conformational changes underpin hexameric motor mechanism,
we conducted both solution and crystallographic structural
studies of E. coli Rho with the goal of characterizing novel
conformational intermediates in conjunction with different RNA
sequences and nucleotide-binding modes. Small-angle X-ray
scattering (SAXS) confirmed that the current open- and closedring models imaged crystallographically correspond to dominant
states adopted in solution in the absence and presence of substrates, respectively, and further establish that Rho ring closure
occurs only when both RNA and ATP are present. Three crystal
structures of Rho (including an experimentally phased structure
at higher resolution than that determined previously) reveal ring
rearrangements accompanying ATP cycling, which, together with
comparisons to other oligomeric RecA-family motors, uncover a
common allosteric linkage that physically connects nucleic-acid
binding with ATPase activation in members of this widespread
motor family. Together, our data highlight unexpected substeps
in the Rho loading/translocation cycle and help explain previous
research implicating RNA sequence as a regulator of Rho
function in transcription termination (36–39).
Results
Both RNA and ATP Are Required to Drive Rho Ring Closure. To probe

how Rho physically and differentially responds to the binding of
substrates such as nucleotide and RNA, we first used SAXS to
verify whether available crystal structures of the helicase correspond to major or minor population states in solution (Fig. 1 A
and B and SI Appendix, Fig. S1 A and B) (40). SAXS is an ideal
technique for analyzing the ensemble of states accessed in solution by macromolecular assemblies with conformational or
configurational flexibility (41). SAXS data were initially collected on Rho in the absence of ligand and on Rho mixed with
one molar equivalent per hexamer of a poly-pyrimidine RNA
(rU12) and 2 mM ADP·BeF3, a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog.
E7692 | www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1616745113

Consistent with size-exclusion chromatography (SI Appendix,
Fig. S1 C and D), SAXS curves for Rho exhibited no sign of
aggregation under any of the conditions tested, and distance
distribution (P(r)) profiles, Guinier analysis, and Kratky plots also
were consistent with a well-behaved, hexameric particle (SI Appendix, Fig. S2 and Table S1). Notably, data collected in the
absence and presence of both RNA and ADP·BeF3 proved to be
extremely close matches to the theoretical curves calculated from
crystal structures of models of open- and closed-ring states of
Rho, respectively (Fig. 1 A and B). Although our theoretical
models do not fully account for interdomain and intersubunit
flexibility [which would require polymer physics-based modeling
of all flexible connections (42)], our data indicate that the openand closed-ring crystal structures seen previously for Rho are
consistent with the conformations of native particles observed
in solution.
To assess the individual contributions of RNA and nucleotide
to ring closure, we next conducted SAXS experiments in either
the presence or absence of RNA and over several ADP·BeF3
concentrations. Data collected in the absence of RNA, but with
0, 0.5, 1, or 2 mM ADP·BeF3, induced only modest changes in
the scattering profile (SI Appendix, Fig. S1A). By contrast, scattering data collected in the presence of RNA exhibited distinct
changes as ADP·BeF3 concentrations were increased (SI Appendix, Fig. S1B). Data collected at intermediate concentrations
of nucleotide could not be properly modeled by individual
Rho crystal structures, so we used the programs FOXS and
OLIGOMER to fit a two-component model consisting of both
the open- and closed-ring Rho structures (SI Appendix, Tables S2
and S3) (43–45). The two-component analysis produced greatly
improved fits for the intermediate states, indicating that, in the
absence of RNA and nucleotide, the vast majority of Rho hexamers are open in solution and remain so even at high (2 mM)
ADP·BeF3 concentrations (Fig. 1C). By contrast, with the addition of RNA, nucleotide titration leads to ring closing in Rho,
such that by 2 mM ADP·BeF3, the hexamer population is
dominated by the closed-ring state. Together, these data confirm
that Rho forms an open lock-washer in solution and further
demonstrate that both RNA and nucleotide are required to
promote ring closure (5). This RNA- and ATP-dependent conformational change in Rho may correspond to the rate-limiting
step previously observed in stopped-flow kinetics measurements of ATP hydrolysis (46), a concept supported by the
marked acceleration of both ATPase and ring closure rates in
response to primary site occupancy (38, 47).

RhoPolyU-P1 model primarily in the position of subunit F and in the Q and R loops
of subunits A and E.

A Closed-Ring Rho State Manifests a Sequential Shift in ATPase
Status. Having established that existing crystallographic struc-

tures are suitable models for the open and closed Rho states in
solution, we next set out to determine whether different substratebound, closed-ring forms of Rho might exist. We postulated that
different RNA sequences or nucleotide-binding conditions might
influence the formation of such intermediates. Because our initial
closed-ring Rho crystals were difficult to work with (hereafter
referred to as RhoPolyU-P1, in reference to the RNA sequence and
space group in which the protein crystallized) (48), we set out to
find a new crystal packing arrangement that could be obtained in
the presence of different RNA and nucleotide conditions, but that
still possessed at least one complete Rho hexamer per asymmetric
unit (so as to image the particle in the absence of crystal symmetry
influences). We therefore conducted a new, broader set of screens
with purified Rho in the presence of RNA and nucleotide, discovering a crystal form belonging to the space group P21 that
satisfied these criteria (Methods).

From the new Rho form, we were able to experimentally
phase and refine a higher-resolution (2.6 Å) structure of an
intact hexamer bound to seven nucleotides of a centrally associated poly-U RNA, and that displayed electron density for
ADP·BeF3·Mg2+ bound to all six ATP-binding sites (hereafter
referred to as RhoPolyU-P21) (Fig. 2 A–D and Table 1). The experimental phases and higher resolution allowed us to correct
two small building errors in previous Rho structures (SI Appendix,
Fig. S3). A global alignment of the new RhoPolyU-P21 model with
the original Rho PolyU-P1 state revealed that the two hexamers are highly similar structurally (Fig. 2A), with a root mean
squared deviation (rmsd) for all shared backbone Cα atoms of
1.55 Å. As seen previously, five subunits of the RhoPolyU-P21 state
form a smoothly ascending spiral staircase that wraps around a
single-stranded RNA helix; the sixth (subunit F) occupies a
“transit” position midway between the uppermost (A) and bottommost (E) protomers to close the ring (Fig. 2B). In addition,
four classes of nucleotide-binding sites were again evident at the
six intersubunit interfaces. Using criteria such as nucleotide B
factors [a measure of positional accuracy, or “orderedness” (49)]
and coordination geometry, these sites have been classified as
corresponding to either “exchange” (E), “ATP-bound” (T),
“hydrolysis” (T*), or product (D) states along the ATPase cycle
(Fig. 2A) (29).
Globally, the conformations of the ATPase sites and the sequential order of ATPase states in the new RhoPolyU-P21 Rho model
initially appeared similar to those seen in the original RhoPolyU-P1
structure, with the modeled nucleotides refining to a relative Bfactor distribution consistent with the formation of three tight and
three weak ATP-binding environments as observed biochemically
(50–55) (SI Appendix, Fig. S4). However, inspection of the distance
vectors calculated between Cα atoms for the RhoPolyU-P1 and
RhoPolyU-P21 models revealed that subunit F, as well as the RNAbinding R loops of subunits E and A, have moved with respect to
one other around a vector approximately parallel to the ring axis
(Fig. 2E).
Because the A, F, and E subunits are thought to represent the
likely sites for the release of nucleotide hydrolysis products and the
binding of fresh ATP within the hexamer (29), we elected to
compare the nucleotide-binding regions of the two Rho models in
more detail. This analysis uncovered pronounced changes in some
of the nucleotide-binding sites, which, in turn, revealed a shift in the
pattern of functional states between the RhoPolyU-P1 and RhoPolyU-P21
forms of Rho (Figs. 2A and 3). The most striking change was that the
presumptive catalytic water molecules seen in subunit A and B active
sites of the initial closed-ring structure now appear in the catalytic
centers of subunits B and C in the new structure (Figs. 2A and 3 A–C
and SI Appendix, Fig. S5 A–C). Moreover, each of these waters
also has shifted its local position from a nonideal location in the
RhoPolyU-P1 model to take up a direct, in-line attack configuration with the BeF3 group of the bound nucleotide in the
RhoPolyU-P21 structure (Fig. 3B). Repositioning of the waters is
mediated at both interfaces by a conserved arginine [the “arginineswitch” (RS), R269], the catalytic glutamate (CE) residue (E211)
that polarizes the water to assist hydrolysis, and a backbone carbonyl
(G337) of the adjacent protomer. The glycine-mediated contact was not
observed in the prior RhoPolyU-P1 structure. Consistent with biochemical
studies implicating their importance to overall Rho function
(10, 56–60), a conserved network of ion pairs at the B/C and
C/D interfaces—which runs from the RNA-binding pore to the
ATPase center—appears to help orient amino acids responsible
for in-line placement of the attacking water (SI Appendix, Fig.
S6). Overall, the new placement for the catalytic waters in
RhoPolyU-P21, together with other changes in the relative orientations of catalytically important amino acids (Fig. 3 and SI Appendix,
SI Discussion), supports the proposed existence of hydrolysis-competent active sites in the closed-ring Rho states (29). This shift also
advances the relative position of the two T* states by one subunit

toward the lone E state and adds a second D state compared with the
RhoPolyU-P1 structure determined previously (Fig. 2A).
Intersubunit Relationships in the Nucleotide-Exchange Region Mirror
Those of an Open-Ring State. A key supposition of the rotary cycling

model based on the original RhoPolyU-P1 crystal form has been that
the E/F interface, which is relatively open and solvent exposed,
corresponds to a nucleotide-exchangeable (E) site where substrate
can bind to or product can dissociate from the hexamer, respectively (29). To test this idea, we back-soaked nucleotide out of
the new RhoPolyU-P21 crystal form and determined the structure of
the helicase by X-ray crystallography. Inspection of all active sites
in the model revealed very weak and discontinuous electron
density for the nucleotide-binding site of subunit E, indicating a
very low occupancy for ADP·BeF3 that precluded modeling of
nucleotide into the site (nucleotide density in the other active sites
was unchanged) (Fig. 4 A and B). Intersubunit distance vectors
calculated between the back-soaked structure (referred to hereafter as RhoEmpty) and the fully occupied RhoPolyU-P21 structure
show that the relative positions of subunits E and F shift by ∼1.7 Å
with respect to one another, but that the rest of the subunits in the
hexamer undergo only minor positional changes (Fig. 4C). A
comparison of the E/F interface in the presence and absence of
ADP·BeF3 reveals an increased separation of the two subunits
that moves the Arg finger out of the active site and that buries
∼120 Å2 less total surface area at the interface (Fig. 4D). Together, these observations further confirm the proposition that the
E/F active site corresponds to a nucleotide-exchange point, and
show that product release coincides with an increased opening
of the subunit interface at this catalytic center. Interestingly,
upon the disappearance of nucleotide from the E state, the
relative B factors for the nucleotide in the active site of subunit
F also increase relative to other Rho structures (SI Appendix,
E7694 | www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1616745113

Fig. S4), suggesting that product release may cooperatively
weaken the association of nucleotide in the immediately adjacent D state.
Inspection of the E/F active site shows that the E state is
unique within the closed-ring Rho hexamer in adopting a relative
intersubunit orientation markedly different from that of the
other protomers. This altered configuration arises due to a
transition of subunit F (which is flanked by subunits A and E,
respectively) from the top step of the helical RNA staircase to
the bottom (Fig. 2B). Subunit F is also the only protomer that
does not contact RNA in any closed-ring structure determined
so far, and its interface with subunit E in the RhoEmpty structure
represents a completely substrate-free component of the catalytic
cycle. Given these considerations, we compared the intersubunit
positions of the E/F protomer conformation of the back-soaked
model with those of a completely RNA-free, open-ring Rho
structure of Rho determined previously. Interestingly, the intersubunit orientation of motor domains in the open-ring structure
[Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID code 1PVO], which all assemble with
a left-handed helical pitch, proved to be a very close match to the
orientation of the E/F protomer pair in both the RhoEmpty and
RhoPolyU-P21 structures, but distinct from other subunit dimers in the
RNA-bound models (which adopt a right-handed pitch) (Fig. 4E).
This congruency indicates that, upon ATPase product and RNA
release, a single interface in the Rho hexamer relaxes to an energetically favorable conformation present in the open-ring Rho
structure. Therefore, the nucleotide-dependent structural transition,
which promotes ring opening and closing during RNA loading, also
plays a direct role in catalytic cycling.

structure. (D) Subunit D/E interface. This site retains contacts characteristic of the T state in both structures. The CE in RhoPolyU-P21 has broken its atypical contact with
the Mg2+ ion observed in RhoPolyU-P1, suggesting that it is transitioning to a slightly more active arrangement. (E) Subunit E/F interface. The arginine finger in the
RhoPolyU-P1 E state appears to be pointing out of the active site, whereas the arginine finger in RhoPolyU-P21 clearly points into the active site and coordinates the bound
BeF3. However, the arginine valve in the RhoPolyU-P21 structure is pulled slightly out of the active site, resulting in the same number of contacts between the arginine
groups and the BeF3 molecule. The catalytic glutamate in this active site is in an atypical conformation in both structures, interacting with the Mg2+ ion directly
(RhoPolyU-P1) or indirectly via coordinated waters (RhoPolyU-P21). In the 90° rotated view, the catalytic glutamate and arginine switch in RhoPolyU-P21 are moved out of the
catalytic site in the E state compared with the RhoPolyU-P1 structure. (F) Subunit F/A interface. The arginine valve in the RhoPolyU-P1 D state points out of the active site,
whereas the arginine valve in the RhoPolyU-P21 structure points into the active site and coordinates the bound BeF3. In the 90° rotated view, the arginine valve now
points into the active site due to an opening of the intersubunit interface in RhoPolyU-P21 relative to RhoPolyU-P1 that relieves a steric clash between the guanidinium
group of the arginine and G337 of the adjacent subunit.

with pyrimidine-rich RNAs providing a greater increase in ATP
turnover compared with purine-rich substrates (37, 38). To better understand this dependency, we crystallized and determined
the structure of Rho in complex with a poly-purine RNA (rA12)
and ADP·BeF3 (hereafter referred to as RhoPolyA) and compared it to the other Rho structures determined thus far (Fig. 5).
Notably, the Rho·poly-A complex cocrystallized in the same P21
space group and unit cell as the new closed-ring Rho model
bound to poly-U. The poly-A substrate similarly forms an overwound, single-stranded RNA helix in the Rho pore that is highly
similar to that formed by poly-U (Fig. 5 and SI Appendix, Fig.
S7), despite the extra bulk afforded by the additional fivemember ring on the purine bases. This finding indicates that the
tight coiling of RNA seen in the original Rho model is not an
effect of RNA sequence or crystal packing, but likely reflects the
standard manner by which the helicase encircles substrate
during translocation.
Close inspection of the poly-A Rho model with its poly-U
counterparts reveals notable differences in the specifics of RNA
binding (Fig. 5 and SI Appendix, SI Discussion). Interestingly,
these differences are evident not just between purine- and pyrimidine-bound Rho hexamers, but also between the different
poly-U models imaged thus far (Fig. 5 A–C). In particular, the
RhoPolyU-P21 and RhoPolyA structures lack electron density for the
5′-most base present in the original RhoPolyU-P1 structure, and
instead manifest new density for two additional bases at the 3′ end
of the RNA (Fig. 5 and SI Appendix, Fig. S7 B–G). However, the
Thomsen et al.

bound RNAs also show conformational differences between these
three structures, with the additional 3′ nucleotides visible in the
poly-A–bound Rho model extending in a straight line from the
helicase pore, but in the new poly-U structures folding back into a
tight kink that deviates from the interior RNA spiral configuration
but maintains base-stacking interactions (Fig. 5 and SI Appendix,
Fig. S7). The U-U kink seen in the poly-U models allows for a
network of contacts to be formed between the ribose 2′-OH and
the uracil O2 atom of the penultimate nucleotide, a newly evident
water molecule, and Lys-326 of both subunits B and C (the latter
of which alters a contact that had been seen previously between
this invariant amino acid and the backbone phosphate of RNA in
the original RhoPolyU-P1 hexamer) (Fig. 5 A–C and SI Appendix,
Fig. S8). Interestingly, in analyzing the RhoEmpty structure, we
observed electron density for the additional, kinked 3′ bases of
RNA similar to that present in RhoPolyU-P21; however, this
model also exhibited density for the 5′-most base seen in
RhoPolyU-P1 (Fig. 5B and SI Appendix, Fig. S7 B–D). Thus, upon
loss of nucleotide and opening of the E-state active site, the polyU RNA bound to RhoEmpty appears to adopt a hybrid conformation between the original RhoPolyU-P1 crystal form and the
new RhoPolyU-P21 crystal form.

determined here to look more closely at the linkages that mediate intersubunit contacts between the nucleic acid and nucleotide binding sites. By coaligning all six pairwise interfaces of the
RhoPolyU-P21 model, using the ATP-binding P-loop as an reference point, we found that a single α-helix (Rα1), which contains
residues responsible for forming the salt-bridge network linking
the RNA binding pore to the ATPase center, undergoes a large
range of previously unnoticed hinge movements (Fig. 6A and
SI Appendix, Fig. S6). The N terminus of this helix (which corresponds to the “R-loop” of Rho and the “L2”-loop of RecA
helicases such as DnaB and T7 gp4) binds RNA via K326 (Fig.
5), whereas the C terminus of this helix contains backbone carbonyls that interact directly with the catalytic water molecule and
the arginine-based γ-phosphate sensors in the two T* states
(Figs. 3B and 6B). This movement appears to be caused by an
intersubunit levering motion of ∼10 Å at the helix’s N terminus,
which alters the interactions in an ordered manner that correlates with the ATPase state of each subunit (Fig. 6B and Movie
S1). This observation suggests that R-loop–mediated RNA
binding, aided by interactions within an intersubunit allosteric
network, not only positions the catalytic glutamate via the arginine switch residue as described (29), but also directly controls
the position of the arginine finger, arginine valve, and catalytic
water by coupled movements with the associated Rα1 helix.
In conducting this analysis, we note that the α-helix corresponding to Rα1 is a conserved feature of the RecA fold and is
present not only in Rho’s closest homolog [the F1-ATPase (62)],
but also in more distantly related RecA-family hexameric helicases and translocases. In all cases, the C-terminal carbonyls of
the helix equivalent to Rα1 contact amino acids that interact with
the γ-phosphate moiety (and catalytic waters when present) and
that appear poised to help control the active-site organization of
their respective hexameric motors through a similar mechanism
(Fig. 6 C–E) (31, 62, 63). These comparisons indicate that this
helix, which lies downstream of the R/L2 loop region, is likely
involved in allosterically coupling substrate movements to
ATPase status in RecA-like motors in general.

solution-based structural methods and X-ray crystallography to
better understand how a RecA-family hexameric motor protein,
Rho, couples changes in nucleotide status to conformational
transitions that underpin ring loading and translocation events.
Our SAXS data confirm that distinct open- and closed-ring
structures are accessed before and after RNA engagement, respectively (Fig. 1 A–C), suggesting that the transition between
these two states likely occurs as a relatively simple rigid body
rotation of subunits with respect to each other (Movie S2).
Notably, our studies indicate that at nucleotide concentrations
approaching those in the cell [values between 2 and 10 mM ATP
have been measured for E. coli (64–66]], Rho spontaneously and
preferentially occupies an open-ring state, a form that is well suited
for engaging nascent RNA transcripts. A need for contacts engendered by both substrate nucleic acid and ATP binding to cooperatively induce ring closure is consistent with the idea that
formation of a translocation-competent state may capture and

structures are at the E/F interface. (D) Superposition of chain E from the
RhoPolyU-P21 and RhoEmpty structures reveals that nucleotide release induces a
rigid body shift in chain F (arrows) that causes the active site to open. The

RNA Sequence Dependencies of the Rho Functional Cycle. In addition
to the insights afforded into ring dynamics and the establishment of
a sequential ATPase order, the structures presented here help to
explain some of the known effects that RNA sequence has on Rho’s
ATPase activity. In general, the molecular basis for substrate-specific sequence dependencies in hexameric helicases and translocases
has remained relatively ill-defined. Some ring-shaped helicases,
such as T7 gp4, decelerate when confronted with GC-rich duplexes
(69), indicating that motor function can be impacted by substrate
stability. For Rho, transcription termination activity is stimulated by
cytosine-rich sequences (13), due in part to the recognition requirements of its primary RNA (rut)-binding sites (10, 38) and also
to the ability of primary site occupancy to promote Rho ring closure
as demonstrated in the accompanying study (47). However, Rho’s
RNA-stimulated ATPase and translocation activities also appear to
be directly affected by pyrimidine-specific sequence preferences
independent of primary site interactions (36–38).
The differences in secondary-site RNA binding seen here between
poly-U and poly-A bound forms of Rho (along with the preferential
ring closure capability of poly-U over poly-A described in the accompanying study (47) indicate that sequence discrimination in the
helicase may in part arise from interrogation of RNA sequence at
the point where the nucleic acid threads into the ring. In particular,
the 3′ kink seen in the new RhoPolyU-P21 structure allows a ribose 2′OH and two pyrimidine bases to interact with an invariant lysine,

harness strain as a motive force to help promote nucleotide cycling.
Consistent with this model, the formation of a relaxed, left-handed
intersubunit orientation characteristic of the open-ring structure is
seen only in the product release state, which also releases its grip
on RNA to reset the RNA binding cycle (Fig. 4E).
Strain imparted by substrate-induced conformational changes may
underlie ATP cycling in other, more distantly related hexameric helicases. For example, recent structures of DnaB-family helicases have
shown that the ATPase domains of these hexameric motors adopt an
uncoupled, planar conformation in the absence of nucleic acid substrate (67), but form a steep, right-handed helical conformation with a
single open interface when DNA and GDP·AlF4 are present (31, 67).
Electron microscopy data on the eukaryotic minichromosome maintenance proteins (MCMs) have revealed that a left-handed open-ring
conformation is the default state of metazoan MCM hexamers (27),
and that the Cdc45·GINS complex, along with ATP and DNA, are
needed to drive the formation of a stable closed ring with an internal,
right-handed pitch (26, 34). Together, these studies support the idea
that nucleic acids cooperatively activate ATP hydrolysis in many ringshaped RNA and DNA translocases by serving as a template for the
asymmetric assembly of ATPase subunits. This asymmetry, in turn,
promotes the formation of a defined sequence and order of active-site
states (29, 30), which allows the energetics of cooperative substrate
binding in one subunit to be allosterically coupled to cooperative
product release in another. One exception to this trend may be the
papilloma virus E1 helicase, in which five of its six subunits have been
seen to adopt a right-handed spiral as part of closed-ring hexamer in
the absence of ATP and DNA (68).

allows for the modeling of eight bases of RNA (orange/white). Compared
with the RhoPolyU-P1 structure, there is additional density for two 3′ bases in a
kinked conformation. (C) The RhoPolyU-P21 structure allows for modeling of
seven bases of RNA (orange/white). Compared with the RhoEmpty structure,
density is lacking for the 5′ base. This structure reveals a hydrogen-bonding
network stabilizing interactions between R-loop residue K326 of subunits B
and C, a water molecule, and the 2′-OH and uracil base of the bound RNA
kink. (D) The structure of RhoPolyA solved under similar conditions to
RhoPolyU-P21 also reveals two additional 3′ bases, but in a pseudo A-form
helical arrangement, rather than the kinked conformation. In contrast to the
H-bonding network observed with the kinked PolyU substrate, no additional
protein–RNA contacts are formed.

Lys-326, on two different R loops. These contacts are absent in
the 3′ RNA region when Rho is bound to poly-A and in the original
RhoPolyU-P1 model (where the 3′ nucleotides are unstructured;
Fig. 5). Intriguingly, the lysines involved in binding the U-U kink in
RhoPolyU-P21 project from subunits B and C, which also manifest the
two T* states observed in the hexamer (Fig. 2A). These interactions
suggest that Lys-326, in addition to its role neutralizing the backbone charge of RNA bound in Rho’s translocation pore (29), may
also serve as a sensor for RNA sequence to help properly organize
the B- and C-subunit active sites (Fig. 3A). Such a function would
explain why pyrimidine-rich rut sites are particularly well-suited as
secondary site ligands to promote nucleotide hydrolysis by Rho, in
that they stabilize an RNA structural motif that reciprocally helps
set up an idealized ATPase configuration.
The differences in the 3′ RNA structure seen here for the
purine and pyrimidine substrates likewise have implications for
understanding how RNA sequence is coupled to stepping efficiency. For instance, by using nucleotide analog interference
mapping (NAIM) to insert dNTPs into RNA, Rho has been
found to be inhibited by the presence of deoxyribose at intervals
of every seven nucleotides, with the level of inhibition dependent
on the local sequence environment (36). Our structures reveal
that pyrimidine, but not purine substrates, can specifically interact with Lys-236 of Rho by forming a specific kink that involves the 2′-OH and pyrimidine base of the incoming 3′-RNA
end (Fig. 5). Given that movements of the R-loop are directly
coupled to changes in the allosteric network that couples
ATPase status with RNA binding (Fig. 6 and SI Appendix, Fig.
S6) (29), the ability to adopt a kink by pyrimidines may help
underpin the positional and sequence dependency of the 2′-OH
activation step seen to occur approximately every seven steps by
NAIM (36, 70).
Structural Snapshots Reveal Translocation Substeps in a Hexameric
Motor Protein. The present study provides the most comprehen-

sive structural analysis to date for a hexameric helicase bound to
different nucleic acid substrates and nucleotide intermediates. In
comparing the original RhoPolyU-P1 and the new RhoPolyU-P21 models
of Rho, both hexamers can be seen to possess a single E-state
active site (subunit E) that sits adjacent to a T (ATP-bound)

state ATPase center (subunit D). The two structures diverge,
however, in that the RhoPolyU-P1 form contains a second T-state
active site (subunit C) followed by two hydrolysis-like T* states
(subunits B and A), whereas the RhoPolyU-P21 model is shifted,
possessing a lone T-state followed immediately by two T* catalytic centers (Fig. 2). As a consequence, the RhoPolyU-P1 structure
contains only a single product (D) state (subunit F), whereas the
corresponding Rho PolyU-P2 1 structure contains two (subunits F
and A). This observation is consistent with prior studies showing
that there exists a 2- to 4-subunit delay in ATP hydrolysis and
product release in Rho and related RecA-family hexameric helicases such as T7 gp4 (ref. 71 and SI Appendix, SI Discussion).
Although the E-state active site (subunit E) remains the most
solvent-accessible ATPase center in both crystal forms of Rho,
changes in the relative disposition of key functional amino acids
are nonetheless evident for this region between the RhoPolyU-P1
and RhoPolyU-P21 structures. In particular, the subunit E active
site of the new RhoPolyU-P21 model exhibits a displaced and offline catalytic glutamate, but forms a new contact between the
arginine finger and the BeF3 moiety; by contrast, in the original
RhoPolyU-P1 structure, the correct positioning of the catalytic
glutamate is maintained but the arginine-finger/nucleotide contact is broken (Fig. 3 D and E). Concomitant with these changes,
two bases at the 3′ end of the bound RNA become ordered
and coordinated in the RhoPolyU-P21 structure, whereas in the
RhoPolyU-P1 model, only a single extra base is apparent at the 5′
RNA end (Fig. 5). Interestingly, back-soaking of the new poly-U
Rho crystal form, which results in nucleotide dissociation from
the E-subunit interface, produces a hybrid state in which RNA
density is evident at both the 5′ and 3′ ends.
Together, the suite of Rho structures not only recapitulates
the movements expected for 5′→3′ translocation along RNA, but
also highlights the existence of substeps within the context of a
sequential ATPase mechanism (Fig. 7 and Movie S3). In this
scheme, formation of an empty ATPase center would promote
downstream (3′) contacts between Rho and its substrate, while
maintaining 5′ interactions leftover from the prior round of hydrolysis. ATP binding would next disrupt the 5′ RNA contact,
initiating a new translocation cycle to pull the 3′ end of the

bound RNA into the motor pore. Finally, product formation
would complete the translocation step, helping to shepherd the
5′ RNA end out of the helicase, after which ADP release would
reset the system by forming new contacts to the incoming 3′ base.
Although conformational substeps have been observed structurally for superfamily 1 and 2 helicases and for motors such as
the F1 ATPase, myosin, and kinesin (72–75), similar insights
have not been forthcoming for hexameric helicase/translocase
systems. Functional substeps (as well as macrosteps) are frequently observed in single-molecule studies of motor proteins
(76, 77), but the architectural underpinnings of these events often remained unresolved. The present work demonstrates the
existence of distinct physical substates in a RecA-family hexameric helicase and, moreover, implicates both RNA binding
and different stages of the ATPase cycle in the formation and
dissolution of these states. Future efforts involving high-resolution
single-molecule studies and structure-guided mutagenesis are
needed to establish the timing by which different states interconvert with each other and the role that specific, protein1. Delagoutte E, von Hippel PH (2003) Helicase mechanisms and the coupling of helicases within macromolecular machines. Part II: Integration of helicases into cellular

Structural Analysis. All figures were prepared by using PyMOL (Schrödinger).
Structural superpositions were conducted with the CEALIGN PyMOL plugin (81).
Energy-minimized linear interpolations were computed by using a CNS script
written by the Yale Morph Server (82). To place atomic B factors from different
structures on the same relative scale (SI Appendix, Fig. S4), atomic B factors for
each structure were divided by the average B factor for that structure and then
multiplied by the average B factor for all structures. Distance vectors between
various Rho structures were calculated as described (83). Vector length corresponds to distances between Cα atoms among different structures multiplied by
a scale factor of three to assist visualization, and vector color corresponds to
relative distance (dark blue, 0 Å; red, 1.5 Å or greater).

Methods
SAXS Data Collection and Analysis. Native Rho protein was prepared in a
similar manner to selenomethionine-labeled protein as described (22). Rho
protein (40 mg/mL) in size-exclusion buffer [50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 500 mM KCl,
10% (vol/vol) glycerol, and 1 mM Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP)) was
dialyzed overnight into SAXS buffer (150 mM KCl, 50 mM Hepes pH 7.5, 5 mM
MgCl2, and 5% (vol/vol) glycerol). Dialyzed protein was then further diluted to a
concentration of 5 mg/mL in SAXS buffer containing various concentrations of
RNA (rU12) or ADP·BeF3, aliquoted into a 96-well plate, and used for data
collection at room temperature using an automated system at Advanced Light
Source Beamline 12.3.1. Raw SAXS data were integrated, scaled, and buffersubtracted with the program OGRE (Greg Hura, Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory, Berkeley, CA). PRIMUS was used to merge data from a 1- and 10-s
exposure and to manually remove outliers near the beam stop to obtain highquality scattering curves with very little noise (43). Guinier analysis was performed by using AUTORG (78). Distance distribution functions [P(r)], maximum
diameters (Dmax), and real- and reciprocal-space radius of gyration (Rg) values
were calculated with GNOM (79). Structural models were generated by using an
open-ring Rho model [PDB ID code 1PVO (22)] and the closed-ring crystal
structure determined here (RhoPolyU-P21). Missing loops or domains were added
to the structural models by superposition with other structures or subunits
containing the missing residues. OLIGOMER and FOXS were used to compare
theoretical scattering curves to the data and compute the relative contributions
of multicomponent datasets (44, 45, 80). Background subtraction as implemented in FOXS or OLIGOMER was used to account for errors in buffer composition and improve the fit of the high-resolution data.
