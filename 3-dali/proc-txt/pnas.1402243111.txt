The symbiosis between rhizobial microbes and host plants involves
the coordinated expression of multiple genes, which leads to nodule
formation and nitrogen fixation. As part of the transcriptional
machinery for nodulation and symbiosis across a range of Rhizobium, NolR serves as a global regulatory protein. Here, we present
the X-ray crystal structures of NolR in the unliganded form and
complexed with two different 22-base pair (bp) double-stranded
operator sequences (oligos AT and AA). Structural and biochemical
analysis of NolR reveals protein–DNA interactions with an asymmetric operator site and defines a mechanism for conformational
switching of a key residue (Gln56) to accommodate variation in
target DNA sequences from diverse rhizobial genes for nodulation
and symbiosis. This conformational switching alters the energetic
contributions to DNA binding without changes in affinity for the
target sequence. Two possible models for the role of NolR in the
regulation of different nodulation and symbiosis genes are proposed. To our knowledge, these studies provide the first structural
insight on the regulation of genes involved in the agriculturally
and ecologically important symbiosis of microbes and plants that
leads to nodule formation and nitrogen fixation.

he symbiosis between rhizobial bacteria from the Rhizobium,
Sinorhizobium, Mesorhizobium, Azorhizobium, and Bradyrhizobium genera and leguminous plants leads to the formation of
root nodules (1, 2). These plant organs are specialized for nitrogen fixation and assimilation and are of major ecological and
agricultural importance. For example, nitrogen-fixing nodules
account for one quarter of total nitrogen fixed globally each year
(3). The development of nitrogen-fixing nodules by rhizobia
involves a variety of interactions between the plant and microbe;
however, at the center of this process are a set of nod (nodulation)
genes required for the synthesis of oligosaccharide-nodulation factors, for determining host-plant specificity, and for optimizing the
efficiency of symbiosis (4–6). Successful interaction between the
rhizobium and host plant requires expression of both positive and
negative transcriptional control of genes related to nodulation and
symbiosis (7, 8).
Expression of nod genes in rhizobium is regulated by flavonoids
released from the host plant in conjunction with the positive activator NodD, which is a member of the LysR-type transcriptional
regulator (LTTR) family of proteins (9, 10). Extensive analyses
reveal that, in response to small molecules produced by the plant,
the rhizobial NodD protein binds to a cis-acting element—the nod
box—located upstream of genes required for nodulation (11–16). In
addition to the positive control provided by NodD, negative regulation of the nod regulon in Rhizobium meliloti and other rhizobia by
NolR occurs (17, 18).
In rhizobia, NolR modulates expression of the NodD activator
protein, the core nod genes, and multiple genes involved in symbiosis (17, 19–24). Based on amino acid sequence homology, NolR
was proposed to be a helix-turn-helix family member that binds to
a nonpalindromic consensus motif —(A/T)TTAG-N9-A(T/A) (17).

NolR is well-conserved across multiple Sinorhizobium and
Rhizobium species (23). Originally, NolR was identified as a
negative regulator of nodulation that bound to overlapping
transcription initiation sites in the nodD1 and nodA promoters
and at the nodD2 promoter (17). Differential regulation of nod
genes by NolR suggested that only the genes related to the
synthesis of the core Nod factor structure were controlled by this
transcription factor (22). Interaction of NolR with the target
DNA site led to reduced levels of Nod factors (22). Control of
Nod factor production by NolR may also aid in optimization of
nodulation specificity, as NolR binding sequences were later found
in the promoter regions of nodABC, nodD1, ttsI-nodD2, nolR,
hesB, and nodZ (23). Transcript levels of nolR are high in freeliving rhizobia and in the bacteroid but are down-regulated by
luteolin, a nod gene inducer (24). Subsequent studies implicated
NolR as a global regulatory factor that responds to environmental
factors to fine-tune a range of symbiotic signals, not just the
genes required for nodulation, and that the absence or presence of NolR affects symbiotic interactions with host plants (19,
20, 23, 24). For example, NolR represses expression of the type
III secretion system ttsI gene, which is required for secretion of
nodulation outer proteins (nops) that are beneficial for symbiosis
of Sinorhizobium fredii with some soybean cultivars (24). The
molecular basis for NolR recognition of nonpalindromic DNA
target sites and subsequent control of nodulation and symbiosis
genes is unclear.
To understand how NolR functions as a global regulator of
nodulation, we used a combination of X-ray crystallography,
Significance
Nitrogen nodules formed by the symbiosis of rhizobial microbes
and legume roots are essential for fixation of nitrogen in the
environment. As part of the symbiosis that leads to nodule formation, a series of changes in gene expression of the Rhizobium
must occur. The protein NolR is a global regulator of rhizobial
genes for symbiosis and nodulation. Here, we describe the threedimensional structure of this transcription factor in unliganded
and DNA bound forms. These structures show how NolR recognizes asymmetric DNA binding sites and reveal a previously
unknown mechanism for conformational switching that alters
the energetics of interaction to accommodate variable DNA
sequences. Two models for the role of NolR in the regulation of
nodulation and symbiosis genes are also proposed.

thermodynamic analysis of protein–DNA interactions, and site-directed mutagenesis. The structures of NolR in the unbound form
and in complex with two different 22-base pair (bp) double-stranded
DNA fragments (oligos AT and AA) reveal a homodimeric protein
adopting a winged helix-turn-helix fold. These structures suggest
a previously unknown mechanism for conformational switching of
a key glutamine side-chain to accommodate DNA-sequence variation in nonpalindromic operator sites without a loss of interaction
affinity but with altered thermodynamic contributions to binding.

Overall Structure of NolR. NolR from S. fredii USDA191 was ex-

pressed as an N-terminally His-tagged protein in Escherichia coli
and purified by nickel-affinity and size-exclusion chromatography.
The His-tag was removed by thrombin digestion for crystallization.
NolR migrated as a dimeric 26-kDa species (monomer Mr ∼ 13
kDa) by size-exclusion chromatography. Crystals of uncomplexed
native NolR and selenomethionine (SeMet)-substituted NolR in
complex with a 22-bp oligonucleotide duplex corresponding to the
consensus NolR DNA binding motif (oligo AT) were obtained and
optimized for data collection (Table S1). The 3D structure of
SeMet-substituted NolR bound to oligo AT was determined
using single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) phasing.
The resulting model was used to solve the structure of unliganded NolR by molecular replacement.
The overall structure of NolR reveals that the protein is a winged
helix-turn-helix transcription factor (25) (Fig. 1 A and B). Two
α-helices (α1 and α5) of each monomer form the coiled-coil dimerization interface of NolR. A triangular set of α-helices (α2–α4)
positions α3 (residues 45–52) and α4 (residues 55–69) as the helixturn-helix motif for interaction with the DNA major groove, and the
“wing,” a two-stranded antiparallel β-sheet (β1a and β1b), extends
into the minor groove (Fig. 1B). For cocrystallization, the conserved
NolR operator site from R. meliloti was used (Fig. 1C) (17). The
operator contains two conserved motifs with variable positions that
can be either A or T. Comparison of the free and bound forms of
NolR indicates that the structure changes little upon DNA binding
with a 0.433-Å root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) for 196 Cα
atoms in the homodimer. The crystal structure reveals that the
NolR dimer binds to position residues of α4 from one monomer to
contact the first sequence block (Fig. 1 B and C, purple) on the 5′
strand of the operator and that the same helix of the second
monomer interacts with the sequence of the second consensus block
(Fig. 1 B and C, red) on the 3′ strand.
Sequence and structural comparisons identify NolR as a member
of the ArsR/SmtB family of transcription factors (26–29). NolR
shares 22–40% amino acid sequence identity with BigR, HlyU,
CadC, CzrA, NmtR, and SmtB (Fig. S1A). Moreover, the secondary
structure features forming the helix-turn-helix motifs of these proteins are highly conserved (Fig. S1A). A search of the Protein Data
Bank using the DALI server (30) identifies BigR, HylU, and CadC
as the closest structural relatives of NolR (Fig. S1 B–D) with Z-scores
of 14.4–14.9 and 2.0–2.7 Å rmsd for 95–97 Cα atoms (26, 31–33). The
major differences between these proteins occur in the length and
positioning of the N-terminal α-helical region at the dimerization
interface (Fig. S1 B–D). Residues of the regulatory metal-binding
sites found in other ArsR/SmtB family members are missing from
NolR (26–29, 31–33).
Asymmetric Operator Site Recognition by NolR. The structure of
NolR complexed with DNA (Fig. 1 B and C) provides detailed
information on how this homodimeric protein recognizes an
asymmetric operator site to regulate expression of nodulation and
symbiosis genes. Electron density for oligo AT DNA bound to
NolR was well-defined (Fig. S2A). NolR binds to the operator,
with the α4 helix of each monomer positioned 39 Å apart within
major grooves of the DNA duplex (Fig. 1B). The molecular surface of NolR along the DNA-binding interface of each monomer
is positively charged and provides an interaction surface for

phosphate groups of the DNA whereas the opposite side of NolR is
largely negative in charge (Fig. S2B). Analysis of the operator DNA
geometry using 3D-DART (34) shows that the duplex bends 16.8°
from an ideal B-form upon interaction with NolR (Fig. S2C). Each
monomer of the NolR dimer interacts with a sequentially distinct
half-site on the operator primarily through residues on α4 (Fig. 2).
Within the first block of the consensus sequence (Fig. 2A, purple), two clusters of residues from chain A form extensive interactions with the phosphate backbone of each DNA chain (Fig. 2 A
and B). Gln79, Ile81, and Tyr83 hydrogen bond with T1 and A2 of
the 5′ strand. On the 3′ strand, Asn28, Arg31, and His62 contact the
phosphates of T17’ and C18’. Gln56, Ser57, Ser60, and Gln61
provide hydrogen-bond interactions with T1, A2, T3, and T4 of the
5′ strand. Ser57 and Gln61 hydrogen bond with T19’ and A20’ of
the complementary strand. At the second half site, (Fig. 2A, red)
a similar set of residues from monomer B provides additional
protein–DNA contacts (Fig. 2 A and C). Gly46, Arg67, Ile81, and
Tyr83 of chain B interact with the phosphate groups of C6’, T7’, and
T8’ on the 3′ strand. In the second site, Ser60 from α4 hydrogen
bonds to the phosphate of T7’ instead of a nucleotide base. Interactions with the 5′-strand phosphates of C12 and C13 are contributed by Asn28, Lys30, Arg31, and His62. The β-sheet wing of
monomer B binds in the minor groove to place Gln79, which is on
the loop between the two β-strands, within hydrogen-bond distance
of A21 and A22 of the 5′ strand (Fig. 2A and Fig. S3). Ser57 of

In contrast, the side-chain of Gln56 in the second site, which was
oriented away from T7’ in the NolR•oligo AT crystal structure,
flips to position the amide group for interaction with A7’ in the
NolR•oligo AA complex (Fig. 3 B and C). Movement of Gln56
to accommodate the variable A/T positions in each half-site of
the NolR consensus DNA binding sequence provides a mechanism for recognition of diverse operator sites of genes involved in
nodulation and symbiosis of rhizobia and plants (17).

The X-ray crystal structures of NolR bound to oligo AT (Fig. 2)
and oligo AA (Fig. 3) provide molecular insight on how changes
in the position of Gln56 allows for interaction with operator sites
with varied sequence at key positions. To examine NolR binding
to varied target sites, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was
used to characterize interaction with oligos AT and AA. Binding
of each DNA duplex to NolR was observed by ITC (Fig. S5);
however, the energetic contributions to protein–DNA interaction
varied for each operator sequence (Table 1). Analysis of DNA
binding to NolR indicated binding of one dimer per operator
site, as observed crystallographically, with comparable affinity
(Kd ∼ 0.4 μM). Interestingly, the thermodynamics of interaction
were distinct. NolR binding to oligo AT displayed a greater
entropic contribution to protein–DNA interaction whereas association with oligo AA was dominated by enthalpic energy. These
data indicate that differences in operator site sequence do not
alter binding affinity but do change the energetics driving NolR–
DNA interaction.
The structures of NolR also implicate key residues as important for DNA binding. To examine the contribution of Arg31,
Gln56, Ser57, Ser60, and Gln61, a series of site-directed mutants

monomer B provides bridging contacts with the nucleotide bases of
T8’ on the 3′ strand and G15 of the 5′ strand. These interactions are
similar to those observed in chain A. The side-chain of Gln61 hydrogen bonds to T14 of the 5′ strand. Interestingly, the side-chain of
Gln56 in chain B adopts a conformation that flips the amide group
away from T7’ of the 3′ strand. In contrast, the side-chain of Gln56
in the first site is oriented toward the A2 adenine ring.
Movement of Gln56 in Recognition of Variable DNA Sequence. The
shift in position of Gln56 in each half-site of the oligo AT DNA,
either to interact with A2 in the first site or away from T7’ in the
second site, suggested that movement of this residue may play
a role in the previously observed recognition by NolR of variable
operator sites (17–24). To examine the possible role of Gln56 as
a conformational switch in DNA binding, NolR was crystallized
with oligo AA DNA (Fig. 3A). The oligonucleotides used to form
this duplex maintain the sequence of the first half-site but substitute a T for A17 and an A for T7’ on the 5′ and 3′ strands,
respectively. The 3.0-Å resolution crystal structure of NolR in
complex with oligo AA was solved by molecular replacement
(Table S1). The overall structures of NolR with either DNA
bound are nearly identical with a 0.2-Å rmsd for 196 Cα atoms in
the homodimer. Comparison of the orientation of Gln56 in the
DNA binding sites of each structure show that the interaction
with A2 in the first half-site was identical (Fig. 3B and Fig. S4).

were generated, expressed, and purified. The Q56A mutation
was designed to remove the mobile side-chain from NolR for
examination of the energetics of protein–DNA interaction by
ITC. Arg31, which provides a charge–charge interaction with the
DNA backbone, is invariant across members of the ArsR/SmtB
family (Fig. S1A). Ser57, which in NolR is positioned for bridging
interactions between each DNA strand, is also highly conserved
(Fig. S1A). Ser60 provides either a base contact (site 1) or interacts with the phosphate backbone (site 2) and is invariant in
the ArsR/SmtB family (Fig. S1A). Gln61 of NolR is either a glutamine (NolR, BigR, HlyU) or a histidine (CadC, CzrA, NmtR,
SmtB) in the ArsR/SmtB family (Fig. S1A).
The NolR R31A, S57A, S60A, and Q61A mutant proteins
were soluble and migrated as dimeric species, as observed for
wild-type protein; however, each protein displayed a loss of DNA
binding based on the lack of heat signal observed by ITC. These
results indicate that these residues in NolR provide critical interactions for formation of protein–DNA complexes. In contrast,
binding of oligos AT and AA to the NolR Q56A mutant was
observed (Fig. S6). Substitution of Gln56 with an alanine results
in less than twofold changes in the Kd values for each DNA
duplex compared with wild-type NolR (Table 2). Removal of the
amide side-chain in the G56A mutant results in comparable
enthalpic and entropic contributions to DNA binding of each
duplex. This result is consistent with the movement of Gln56
accounting for the energetic differences for variable DNA operator sequences observed with wild-type NolR.
Discussion
Although the symbiosis between rhizobial microbes and host
plants that leads to nitrogen-fixing nodules is an ecologically and
agriculturally important process (1–3), the molecular basis underlying the transcriptional regulation of nodulation and symbiosis remains incompletely understood. Nodulation requires
induction of nod gene expression; however, efficient symbiosis
with host plants occurs only when these genes are expressed in
an appropriate quantitative, spatial, and temporal pattern and
involves both positive and negative regulation (7, 8, 35). Mutations that alter either positive or negative regulation of nod genes
result in aberrant and delayed nodulation phenotypes.
As part of the transcriptional regulation machinery of nodulation and symbiosis in various Rhizobium, NolR was originally
identified as a putative helix-turn-helix family member that bound
a nonpalindromic consensus motif in the core nodABC gene cluster
(17). Later studies broadly implicate NolR as a global regulator of
multiple symbiosis-related genes. The crystal structure of NolR is
consistent with DNA footprinting studies that mapped the operator site as containing the (A/T)TTAG-N9-A(T/A) consensus
motif (17); however, the NolR structures obtained in complex
with two different DNA duplexes (Figs. 1–3) more accurately
define the interaction sequences in each asymmetric half site as
ATTAG on the 5′ strand and CTTC on the 3′ strand. A remarkable
feature of NolR is that the homodimer binds to an asymmetric

operator site with variable sequences at two positions, one in
each half site, which allows versatility in recognition of NolR
operator sites of multiple target genes (19, 20, 22–24).
The 3D structures of NolR in complex with oligo AT (Fig. 2)
and oligo AA (Fig. 3) provide new insight on protein–DNA
interactions that regulate nodulation and symbiosis gene expression. Binding contacts with the phosphate backbone are
largely contributed by residues on α2, α3, and the β-wing. These
contacts likely drive nonspecific association with the operator.
Base-specific interactions come from Gln56, Ser57, Ser60, and
Gln61 on α4 and Gln79 on the β-wing (Fig. 2 and Fig. S3). The
hydrogen-bond network between residues of α4 in each half-site
and the DNA duplex shows conserved interactions for operator
binding. Ser57 anchors protein interaction by contacting T3 in
the first half-site and T8’ in the second half-site (Fig. 2). Ser57
also provides hydrogen bonds with A20’ in site one and G15 in
site two. Gln61 supports the bridging interactions of Ser57 at both
sides of the operator. The amide of Gln61 hydrogen bonds with
T19’ and T14 in the first and second half-sites, respectively. ITC
analysis of the NolR S57A and Q61A mutants, which showed a
lack of interaction, confirms these residues role in DNA binding.
Comparison of NolR operators in nodD1, nodZ, nolR, nodABC,
and ttsI with oligos AT and AA reveals that this central set of
interactions would likely be conserved across recognition sites
(Table S2). In particular, the high conservation of the first half-site
suggests that this site is critical for driving NolR–DNA interaction
and that nucleotide variation in the second half-site leads to differences in repression by NolR; however, further studies are required to examine how sequence variations potentially modify
NolR binding interactions and/or alter target-gene expression.
In addition to these critical contacts with the core consensus
motifs, movement of Gln56 allows for accommodation of variable sequences at A2 and T7’ (Fig. 3). The structure of NolR
with oligo AT showed that the Gln56 side-chain hydrogen bonds
with A2 in the first half-site (Fig. S4) but is flipped away from T7’
in the second site (Fig. 3). Substitution of T7’ with A7’ in oligo
AA provides an additional hydrogen bond interaction that orients Gln56 toward the base (Fig. 3). Although NolR binds both
operator sequences with comparable affinity, the energetics of
protein–DNA interaction differs between the two oligonucleotides (Fig. S5 and Table 1). Interaction with oligo AT displays
a larger contribution from entropy compared with oligo AA, but
introduction of an additional hydrogen-bond interaction with
A7’ in oligo AA enhances the enthalpic component of binding.
Mutation of Gln56 to an alanine did not significantly alter the
affinity of NolR for either oligo AT or oligo AA (Fig. S6 and
Table 2) but led to a decreased enthalpic contribution to binding
of oligo AA. Movement of Gln56 leads to compensatory energetic effects that maintain the binding affinity of NolR for varied
operator sites.
The X-ray crystal structures of NolR in complex with DNA
also provide a first view of protein–DNA interaction in the ArsR/
SmtB transcription factor family (Fig. S1). Unlike other ArsR/
SmtB transcription factors (26–29, 31–33), no global structural

protein that in turn activates expression of genes associated with
symbiosis (i.e., nopX, nopA, rhcJ and rhcQ) (41–43). Bending of
DNA following NodD binding to the nod box has been suggested as important for activating expression of genes downstream (13). Multiple studies suggest that binding of LTTR
transcription factors at activator sites alters DNA structure to
allow for either direct interaction with RNA polymerase or to
enhance RNA polymerase promoter escape by DNA bending
(10). In the case of the nodABC gene cluster, the NolR operator
overlaps with the nod box (17, 23). Binding of NolR at the operator may either physically compete with NodD at the nod box
or alter bending at the promoter to down-regulate expression of
downstream nodulation genes (Fig. 4B). The structures of NolR
complexed with DNA suggest that the β-wing and α3 would likely
sterically interfere with NodD binding at the nod box. It is possible that bending of the operator by NolR (Fig. S2C) either
rigidifies the DNA to alter interaction with the promoter or
changes the structure of the nod box to modulate NodD interaction. Further studies are needed to fully understand how these
opposing transcription factors modulate gene expression.
In conclusion, the structural and thermodynamic studies presented here provide, to our knowledge, the first insights on the
molecular foundation for the regulation of gene expression in
nodulation and symbiosis and suggest how the global regulatory
protein NolR recognizes variable asymmetric operator sites in
the promoter regions of diverse rhizobial genes.
Methods
Protein Expression, Purification, and Mutagenesis. The coding region of nolR
was PCR-amplified from S. fredii USDA191 genomic DNA using oligonucleotide primers that included NdeI and XhoI restriction sites, respectively, to
facilitate cloning. The PCR product was digested with NdeI and XhoI and
ligated into pET-28a. The resulting vector was then transformed into E. coli
BL21 (DE3) cells. Transformed E. coli cells were grown at 37 °C in Terrific
broth containing 50 μg·mL−1 kanamycin until A600nm ∼ 0.6–0.9. After induction with 0.1 mM isopropyl 1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside, the cultures
were grown at 20 °C overnight. Following centrifugation, the cell pellet was
suspended in 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, 1 mM
β-mercaptoethanol (βME), 10% (vol/vol) glycerol and 1% Tween 20. Sonication was used for cell lysis. After centrifugation, the supernatant was
passed over an Ni2+-nitriloacetic acid column. The column was washed with
buffer minus Tween 20, and the bound His-tagged protein was eluted using
250 mM imidazole in wash buffer. The N-terminal His-tag was removed by
thrombin digestion in dialysis against wash buffer. A mixed Ni2+-nitriloacetic
acid/benzamidine Sepharose column was used to remove undigested protein and thrombin. Size-exclusion chromatography was performed using a
Superdex-75 26/60 FPLC column equilibrated in 150 mM Tris (pH 8.5), 100 mM
NaCl, and 5 mM βME. Fractions corresponding to the protein peak were
pooled and concentrated to 10 mg·mL−1 by centrifugal filtration. Protein
concentration was determined using the Bradford method, with BSA as
a standard. SeMet-substituted NolR protein was produced by inhibition of
the E. coli methionine biosynthesis pathway (44) and was purified as described above. Site-directed mutants of NolR (R31A, Q56A, S57A, S60A,
and Q61A) were generated using the QuikChange PCR method and were
expressed and purified using the same methods used with wild-type NolR.
Protein Crystallography. All NolR protein crystals were grown by the hanging
drop vapor diffusion method at 4 °C. For crystallization of NolR in the
presence of oligo AT, two 22-bp-long oligonucleotides (5′-dTATTAGAGAACCCTGAAGTTAA-3′ and 5′-dATTAACTTCAGGGTTCTCTAAT-3′) were suspended
in purification buffer and annealed. Crystals of SeMet-substituted NolR
(10.0 mg·mL−1) in complex with oligo AT DNA (1 mM) grew in drops containing a 1:1 mixture of protein and crystallization buffer [20% PEG-3350,
0.1 M sodium citrate/citric acid, and 0.2 M sodium citrate (pH 4.0)]. Crystals of
native NolR (10 mg·mL−1) were formed in drops of a 1:1 mixture of protein
and crystallization buffer [1.6 M sodium phosphate monobasic/0.4 M potassium phosphate dibasic, 0.1 M sodium phosphate dibasic/citric acid (pH
4.2)]. Crystals of native NolR (10 mg·mL−1) in complex with 1 mM oligo AA
DNA (1 mM) (5′-dTATTAGAGAACCCTGATGTTAA-3′ and 5′-dATTAACATCAGGGTTCTCTAAT-3′) were obtained in conditions similar to that of the NolR
oligo AT complex. All crystals were stabilized in crystallization solution with
30% glycerol before flash freezing in liquid nitrogen for data collection at
100 K. All X-ray diffraction data (wavelengh = 0.979 Å) were collected at

changes in the unliganded and DNA bound forms of NolR were
observed, which likely results from a lack of metal-binding sites
in the dimer interface of NolR. In the ArsR/SmtB proteins,
metal binding triggers conformational changes that result in derepression of gene expression by driving repositioning of the
helix-turn-helix DNA interaction motif (26–29, 31–33). This
movement results in a switch from a “closed” DNA-binding structure to an “open” low-affinity conformation of the homodimer.
To date, there is no evidence for other ligand interactions with
NolR that trigger conformational changes that alter binding of
the operator site.
Previous structural studies of ArsR/SmtB proteins largely focused on the role of metal-dependent conformational changes
and not protein–DNA interaction, with one exception. NMR and
mutagenesis probed residues in CzrA from Staphylococcus aureus
for roles in binding to the palindromic 28-bp czr operator (28).
This work suggests that CzrA interaction with target DNA increases protein motion in the allosteric sites and showed essential
roles for residues analogous to Gln56, Ser57, Ser60, and Gln61
in DNA binding by CzrA, but did not reveal the details of protein–
DNA contacts required for phosphate backbone interactions
and/or base specificity.
At the molecular level, interaction of NolR with operator sites
of genes related to nodulation and symbiosis suggests at least two
models for how the repressor functions. The first model of NolR
regulation of gene expression is that of binding to an operator
within the transcription initiation site of a target gene (Fig. 4A).
The NolR binding sites for nodD1, nodZ, and nolR (Table S2)
are all examples of this arrangement. NodD1 is the major transcription factor for nodulation and NodZ is an α1,6-fucosyltransferase for Nod-factor assembly (7–9, 14, 35–40). In each
gene, a NolR operator is positioned 15–60 bp upstream of the
coding region (23). Likewise, the presence of a NolR binding site
35 bp in front of the nolR gene suggests that levels of NolR
modulate its own expression. Increased expression of NolR in
free-living Rhizobia down-regulates expression of nodD1 and
other nodulation/symbiosis genes, such as nodZ (22). In this
arrangement, NolR binding to the operator would compete with
RNA polymerase in the promoter site (Fig. 4A).
A second model of action involves the binding of NolR to its
operator site to alter how NodD either recognizes the nod box or
how it interacts with RNA polymerase at the transcription initiation site (Fig. 4B). NolR operator sites are present in the
regulatory regions of the nodABC operon and the ttsI gene
(Table S2) (23). The role of NodD as a key regulator of nodABC
gene expression is well explored at the genetic level (39). Binding
of NodD to the nod box sequence 218 bp upstream of nodABC
activates gene expression. Similarly, NodD binding to the nod
box 295 bp upstream of the ttsI gene controls expression of a

beamline 19-ID of the Argonne National Laboratory Advanced Photon
Source. HKL3000 (45) was used to index, integrate, and scale diffraction
data. The structure of SeMet-substituted NolR in complex with oligo AT DNA
was determined by SAD phasing. SHELX (46) was used to determine SeMet
positions and to estimate initial phases from the peak wavelength dataset.
Refinement of SeMet positions and parameters was performed with MLPHARE
(47). Solvent flattening using density modification implemented with ARP/
wARP (48) was used to build an initial model. Subsequent iterative rounds of
manual model building and refinement, which included translation-librationscreen parameter refinement, used COOT (49) and PHENIX (50), respectively.
The structures of unliganded NolR and NolR complexed with oligo AA DNA
were solved by molecular replacement in PHASER (51) using the SeMetsubstituted NolR structure as a search model, with model building and refinement performed with COOT and PHENIX. Waters were added to the
unliganded NolR model using default parameters in PHENIX. Crystallographic statistics are summarized in Table S1.
