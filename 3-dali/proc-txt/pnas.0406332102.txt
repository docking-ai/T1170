Cytosolic thymidine kinase 1, TK1, is a well known cell-cycleregulated enzyme of importance in nucleotide metabolism as well
as an activator of antiviral and anticancer drugs such as 3ⴕ-azido3ⴕ-deoxythymidine (AZT). We have now determined the structures
of the TK1 family, the human and Ureaplasma urealyticum enzymes, in complex with the feedback inhibitor dTTP. The TK1s have
a tetrameric structure in which each subunit contains an ␣兾␤domain that is similar to ATPase domains of members of the RecA
structural family and a domain containing a structural zinc. The zinc
ion connects ␤-structures at the root of a ␤-ribbon that forms a
stem that widens to a lasso-type loop. The thymidine of dTTP is
hydrogen-bonded to main-chain atoms predominantly coming
from the lasso loop. This binding is in contrast to other deoxyribonucleoside kinases where specific interactions occur with side
chains. The TK1 structure differs fundamentally from the structures
of the other deoxyribonucleoside kinases, indicating a different
evolutionary origin.

crystal structures 兩 deoxynucleotide metabolism 兩 prodrug activation

A

balanced supply of deoxyribonucleotides is essential for all
living organisms for repair and replication of nuclear, as
well as mitochondrial, DNA. The deoxyribonucleotides are
synthesized by two main routes, the de novo and salvage pathways. In de novo synthesis, deoxyribonucleotides are formed
from ribonucleotides in a regulated manner by the enzyme
ribonucleotide reductase (1). Deoxyribonucleoside kinases
(dNKs) catalyze the first phosphorylation step of deoxyribonucleosides in the salvage pathway (2). Humans have four such
kinases: two cytosolic enzymes, thymidine kinase 1 (TK1) and
deoxycytidine kinase, and two mitochondrial enzymes, thymidine kinase 2 (TK2) and deoxyguanosine kinase, with different
substrate specificities. TK1 differs from the others in several
respects. It has a narrow specificity, phosphorylates only deoxythymidine (dT) and deoxyuridine, and is strictly cell-cycleregulated. TK1 activity is low or absent in resting cells, starts to
occur in late G1 cells, increases in S phase (coinciding with the
increase in DNA synthesis), and disappears during mitosis (3–6).
The synthesis of isotopically labeled dT and the demonstration
of its incorporation into DNA after cellular uptake and phosphorylation were landmark discoveries in cell biology, providing
a way to define the various phases of the cell cycle (7, 8). Recent
studies based on these methods have provided insight into the
role of TK1 and TK2 for the cytosolic and mitochondrial dTTP
pools (9). The researchers demonstrated a rapid exchange of
dTTP between the two compartments. In cells with active TK1,
[3H]dT salvage competed effectively with de novo synthesis, and
most of the mitochondrial pool of labeled dTTP was imported
from the cytosol, indicating low contribution from TK2. In
TK1-deficient cells, however, cytosolic labeled dTTP was derived from the mitochondrial pools because of phosphorylation
of labeled dT by the mitochondrial TK2. That TK1 plays an
important physiological role is further emphasized in studies of
Tk⫺/⫺ knockout mice. Although viable, the TK1-deficient mice
17970 –17975 兩 PNAS 兩 December 28, 2004 兩 vol. 101 兩 no. 52

had an abnormal immune system, developed fatal kidney disease, and had increased mutation rates (10).
In chemotherapeutic treatment of cancer and viral diseases,
deoxynucleoside kinases are key enzymes in the activation of
otherwise nontoxic prodrugs, the nucleoside analogs. Well
known examples are the phosphorylation by herpes virus
1–thymidine kinase (TK) of the guanosine analog acyclovir
and the TK1-catalyzed phosphorylation of the anti-HIV drug
3⬘-azido-3⬘-deoxythymidine (AZT or zidovudine) (11, 12). TK1
is also used in cancer diagnostics (13).
Based on the amino acid sequence, deoxynucleoside kinases
may be arranged in two families: the TK1 family and a family
containing all of the others, the dNKs (12). The dNKs form a
homologous family with sequence similarities throughout the
whole peptide chain, a family to which also insect and herpes
viral dNKs belong (12). Herpes virus 1–TK was the first member
of the family for which the structure was determined (14, 15).
Other members of the dNK family are generally smaller but have
similar core structures, and their different substrate specificity
can be related to a few differences at the active site (12, 16–19).
TK1 has sequence similarities to the dNKs in a P loop but lacks
other significant conserved sequence motifs. Furthermore, the
other dNKs are dimers, whereas the active form of TK1 is a
tetramer (20).
TK1-like sequences are found in a broad variety of organisms
from plants to humans, as well as in poxvira and in several
bacteria, e.g., the Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus and the Gram-negative Escherichia coli. Recently,
Ureaplasma urealyticum TK (Uu-TK) was cloned and expressed
and characterized biochemically (21). U. urealyticum is a mycoplasma species with a known genome of ⬇600 genes (22). These
bacteria colonize the urogenital tract and are associated with
infertility, altered sperm motility, and pneumonia in neonates
(23). Initial characterization of Uu-TK demonstrated that it has
similar enzyme kinetic properties to human TK1 (hTK1) regarding the narrow specificity for deoxyuridine and dT and with
dTTP serving as a feedback inhibitor (21). No genes for the de
novo synthesis of deoxyribonucleotides have been found in the
U. urealyticum genome. Therefore, this bacterium has to rely
solely on salvage for synthesis of DNA precursors. Thus, Uu-TK
is a good target for antibacterial drugs blocking bacterial TK1
but not hTK1.

Despite its metabolic importance and pharmaceutical role in
prodrug activation, no structure of the TK1-like enzymes has
so far been reported. Here we describe the structures of hTK1
as well as Uu-TK, which show a high degree of similarity and
contain a unique Zn domain with a lasso-like loop covering the
nucleoside-binding site. Availability of the 3D structure of
TK1 is valuable for the design of new TK1-selective and
efficient antiviral, antibacterial, and anticancer prodrugs and
specific antibodies for clinical diagnostics.
Methods
lacking 41 C-terminal amino acids was created by inserting a
stop codon after amino acid 193 by the recombinant PCR
technique with the plasmid pGEX-2T-LyTK1val106 as described
in ref. 24. LyTK1Val106 is derived from the tk1 gene from
human lymphocytes (25), where codon 106 encodes a valine
instead of a methionine as reported for the original tk1 clone
(26). Amino acid 106 has been shown to have high impact on
the enzymatic and oligomerization properties of TK1, with the
valine 106 TK1 form behaving essentially as the endogenous
TK1 (25, 27). Comprehensive sequencing studies verify that
valine is, in fact, the naturally occurring amino acid at site 106
(25, 28, 29). Expression and purification of TK1 was performed
as described in ref. 25, except that Triton X-100 replaced
3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate in all buffers.
The U. urealyticum tdk gene was cloned, and native protein
was expressed and purified as described in ref. 21. For
production of selenomethionine (SeMet)-substituted Uu-TK,
the Uu-TK construct was transformed into the chemical
competent, methionine auxotrophic E. coli strain B834(DE3)
(Novagen). The bacterial culture was grown in SelenoMet
media (Molecular Dimensions, Apopka, FL) containing 21.6
gl⫺1 base mix, 5.1 gl⫺1 nutrient mix, 50 ␮g ml⫺1 L-methionine,
and 50 ␮g ml⫺1 carbenicillin at 37°C to an OD of 0.6 at 600 nm.
The SelenoMet media was changed to contain SeMet before

Crystallization. Crystals of the recombinant truncated hTK1

cocrystallized with dTTP were grown with the hanging drop
vapor diffusion method by using Hampton Screen I (Hampton
Research, Aliso Viejo, CA). The final crystallization conditions at 15°C were: 0.1 M Na citrate (pH 5.6), 20% 2-propanol,
and 14 –16% polyethylene glycol 4000. The crystallization
solution was mixed in equal volumes with 7–13 mg兾ml protein
that contained 5 mM dT T P. Both native and SeMetsubstituted Uu-TK were crystallized by using the hanging drop
vapor diffusion method at 15°C. Native protein solution consisted of 8 mg兾ml Uu-TK and 5 mM dTTP, whereas reservoir
solution contained 19% polyethylene glycol 2000, 0.2 M LiCl,
5 mM DTT, and 0.1 M Mes (pH 6.0). SeMet-substituted
protein crystallized in similar conditions. To increase the size
of SeMet crystals, streak-seeding (30 –32) was carried out. The
crystallization solution with 20 –30% glycerol added was used
as cryoprotectant.
Structure Determination. Crystals of hTK1 were soaked in 10 mM

KAu(CN)2 for 40 min and back-soaked for 30 s in a cryosolution containing reservoir solution plus 20% glycerol before
f lash-freezing in liquid nitrogen. Synchrotron data were indexed by using MOSFLM and were scaled with SCALA (33).
Crystals belonged to the space group C2 and contained two
tetramers in the asymmetric unit (subunits A–H). Twelve gold
sites were located by using SHELX (34) and were refined in
AUTOSHARP (35, 36), where two new sites were added. After
heavy-atom site refinement, density modification and solvent
f lattening were performed. The initial electron density map
was obtained with DM (33, 37). Maps were improved by using
eightfold noncrystallographic symmetry (NCS) averaging in
DM, and the major part of the structure was built in this map
by using O (38). After rigid body refinement, refinement was

continued by using a native data set to 2.4-Å resolution.
Eightfold NCS was used during restraint refinement in REFMAC5 (33, 39). A total of 165 residues could be built into the
electron density in the best-defined subunit, subunit G. Statistics for the data collection and refinement are shown in
Table 1.
Native data from Uu-TK were collected at the European
Synchrotron Radiation Facility and processed and scaled by
using DENZO and SCALEPAC (40). A complete single anomalous
diffraction dataset was collected at the peak wavelength. The
data were processed with MOSFLM (41) and scaled with separated anomalous pairs with SCALA (33). Crystals belonged to
the monoclinic space group P21 and contained one tetramer in
the asymmetric unit (subunits A–D). By using data to 4 Å, 12
heavy-atom positions were located with SHELX (34) and refined
in AUTOSHARP (35, 36). Electron density was improved by
cyclic averaging before model-building. From this map, most
of the polypeptide chain could be tracked and assigned with
correct amino acids. After simulated annealing refinement,
performed in CNS (42), most of the polypeptide could be built.
Further refinement with initially strict fourfold noncrystallo17972 兩 www.pnas.org兾cgi兾doi兾10.1073兾pnas.0406332102

graphic symmetry restraints was carried out in REFMAC5 (39).
Restraints were loosened in the latest rounds of the refinement
cycle, and native data to 2.5-Å resolution were used. All
model-building was made by using O (38). Each monomer
consisted of 223 amino acids, of which residues 11–217 were
visible in the electron density (subunits B and D). Monomers
A and C lacked residues 50 – 67 in a f lexible loop. Datacollection and refinement statistics are shown in Table 1.
The sequence alignment was performed in CLUSTALW (43),
and the picture was made by using ALSCRIPT (44). The figures
were made with PYMOL (45).
Determination of Zn2ⴙ Bound to TK. The Zn2⫹ content of truncated
hTK1 and Uu-TK was determined after desalting the enzyme
preparations used for crystallography into buffers with minimal trace metals. Zn2⫹ levels were measured by atomic
absorbance spectroscopy and were related to the protein levels
as determined by the absorbance at 280 nm. The molar ratio
was 0.56 for hTK1 and 0.51 for Uu-TK. No absorbance at
visible wavelengths was detected with the two TK protein
solutions.

as in other structural zinc motifs (52). The zinc atom is ⬇20 Å
from the active site.
The hTK1 crystals contain two tetramers and Uu-TK contains
one tetramer in the asymmetric unit; the tetramers are very
similar to each other (Fig. 1). The monomers are organized with
222 symmetry, and the tetramer has a central channel lined
mainly by polar and charged residues. There are two types of
monomer–monomer interactions in the tetramers. One of these
is dominated by a long helix from the two subunits forming an
antiparallel pair. In the second interaction area, the ␤-sheet of
one subunit is connected in an antiparallel manner by means of
water molecules to the ␤-sheet in another subunit.
In the full-length Uu-TK enzyme, the C-terminal structure,
with an extended arm-like loop and a terminal helix, interacts
with a helix on the adjacent monomer. The missing C terminus
of hTK1 contains a sequence motif (KEN) that serves as an
ubiquination ligase signal involved in the mitotic degradation of
TK1 (6). This part of the human enzyme is probably located in
a similar, exposed subunit-contacting element.
The structures of the distantly related hTK1 and Uu-TK, with
a sequence identity of 30%, are very similar. The subunits can be
superimposed with an rms deviation of 1.2 Å for 147 C␣ atoms.
TK1-like sequences exist for a large number of species that all
have a characteristic sequence pattern with many conserved
residues, indicating that the members of the family have very
similar structures.
The ␣兾␤-domain of TK1 differs from the ␣兾␤-domain of the
other dNKs in strand order and positions of the helices. Particularly, the substrate-binding site that is formed by two helix pairs
and the helical lid structure in the other dNKs are missing. The
finding that TK1 uses a hitherto unknown Zn domain with a
lasso-like loop to interact with the base and has an ␣兾␤-domain
more similar to a domain in RecA proteins than to other dNK
structures indicates a different evolutionary origin of the TK1
family.
The Deoxyribonucleoside-Binding Site. dNKs catalyze the phos-

phoryl transfer from a phosphate donor, normally ATP, to the
nucleoside substrate. The phosphate donor is bound at an
exposed site containing the phosphate-binding P loop, whereas
the deoxynucleoside is bound at a more buried site. dNKs are
generally feedback-inhibited by the dNTP end product. Structural studies of the dNK from Drosophila (Dm-dNK) revealed
a general mechanism for feedback-inhibition of dNKs (53).
The end-product dNTP binds with its base and deoxyribose in
the nucleoside-binding site like a deoxyribonucleoside substrate, and the triphosphates of the inhibitor bind backward to
the phosphate-binding site at the P loop, i.e., as a bisubstrate
inhibitor. The dTTP molecule in TK1s binds similarly as dTTP
in Dm-dNK (Fig. 3) with the base of the dTTP buried within
the protein; the triphosphates are more exposed.
Whereas the triphosphates bind to the ␣兾␤-domain, the base
and the deoxyribose bind in a cleft between the ␣兾␤-domain
and the lasso domain. The base stacks against the conserved
Arg and Tyr on the lasso-domain side. The ring of the
conserved Tyr is parallel to the base and covers most of this
side. On the opposite side, the base stacks against two phenylalanines perpendicularly oriented relative to the base, with
Leu and Val at its edges.
The hydrogen-bond donors and acceptors of the base all form
hydrogen bonds to main-chain atoms (Fig. 3): O2 and N3 form
bonds to main-chain atoms of the lasso-loop and O4 forms bonds
to a main-chain nitrogen of the ␣兾␤-domain. The methyl group
of thymine is positioned in a hydrophobic pocket directed toward
the ␤-carbon of a Ser in Uu-TK and a Thr in hTK1 surrounded
by Met, Leu, and Tyr.
The 3⬘-oxygen atom of the deoxyribose is hydrogen-bonded
to the main-chain amino group of a conserved Gly in the lasso

Results and Discussion
The Structure of TK1s. The difficulty in obtaining a TK1-type TK
structure probably reflects that the enzyme has flexible parts.
Because initial attempts to crystallize hTK1 were unsuccessful,
we truncated the enzyme for the C-terminal 41 amino acids that
previously have been shown to stabilize TK1 during the cell cycle
without abolishing the specific activity (46). The enzymatic and
oligomerization properties of the truncated hTK1 were virtually
unchanged. For further stabilization of the enzyme, we used the
feedback inhibitor dTTP and determined the 3D structures of
C-terminally truncated hTK1 and the full-length Uu-TK in
complex with dTTP. Both structures are tetramers, and each
subunit consists of two domains, one ␣兾␤-domain and a small
zinc-containing domain. The active site is buried between these
domains (Fig. 1).
The ␣兾␤-domain has a central, six-stranded parallel ␤-sheet,
which is sandwiched between a long ␣-helix and the flexible loop
region on one side and three shorter helices on the other side.
The ␣兾␤-domain of TK1 is of the same type as ATP-binding
domains in enzymes of the RecA-F1ATPase family and is present
in several helicases and DNA repair proteins (47). The TK1
domain is generally smaller than those of the other members of
the family. A search at the Dali server (48) reveals that the most
similar structure in the database is CobA, which transfers the
adenosyl moiety from ATP to corrinoid substrates (49). TK1 and
CobA have all six parallel strands and the helices in common, and
the CobA domain is roughly the same size as the ␣兾␤-domain of
TK1. Ninety-one C␣ atoms could be superimposed with an rms
deviation of 1.53 Å. This superpositioning includes all strands
and helices of the domains.
The small domain of 70–80 aa contains a long, lasso-shaped
structure that covers the deoxynucleoside site in TK1 (Fig. 1). No
similar structure was found in the database by using the Dali
server. The domain contains two perpendicular ␤-ribbons connected by a metal that was interpreted as a zinc ion. Direct
chemical analysis confirmed that the enzymes contained zinc.
One of the ␤-ribbons opens up in a lasso-shaped loop that binds
the base of the feedback inhibitor through main-chain hydrogen
bonds. The lasso loop is kept in place by a conserved Arg–Tyr
couple that is hydrogen-bonded and binds to main-chain atoms
(Fig. 2). Arg and Tyr stack against the base of the nucleotide. The
zinc is tetrahedrally coordinated by two cysteine pairs in the
human enzyme as in structural zinc motifs (50, 51). The last of
the cysteines is substituted by a His in the Ureaplasma enzyme

in hTK1) may serve as the catalytic base abstracting a proton,
thereby activating the 5⬘-oxygen to act as a nucleophile in the
reaction. The other dNKs have a Glu in an equivalent position,
implicating similar catalytic mechanisms (12). Beside a Mg ion
bound to the phosphates, Arg-60 (hTK1 numbering) is in a
position to stabilize the transition state of the reaction.
If the P loop, the preceding strand, and the subsequent helix
of TK1 are superpositioned on the other dNKs, the base in TK1
is bound perpendicular to the others, with the tip displaced about
6 Å (Fig. 3). In the other dNKs, a Gln side chain binds at the edge
of the base, and a Tyr–Glu couple binds to 3⬘-OH of the
deoxyribose (12). These features are absent in TK1.

Substrate Specificity. The narrow substrate specificity of TK1 is

consistent with a smaller binding site than in herpes virus 1–TK
and other dNKs, with tight interactions of the protein and the
base by main-chain hydrogen bonds to all polar groups of the
base. At the 5-position of the base, the presence of a halogeno
or ethyl group has no real effect on enzyme activity, consistent
with 5-fluoro-2⬘-deoxyuridine being a good substrate. Bulkier or
more polar groups, as amino and 2-bromovinyl, would be
sterically hindered upon binding (54, 55). This property is
consistent with the rather small hydrophobic pocket, where the
methyl group fits snuggly.
It has been shown that TK1 accepts large substitutions at the
3-position of the ring (56). Although N3 is hydrogen-bonded to
a main-chain carbonyl in this position, the 3-position of the ring
points toward the contact area between the ␣兾␤-domain and the
lasso domain. For large substituents at the 3-position, the lasso
domain may not close down completely, but substituents at N3
may compensate the loss of a hydrogen bond to N3 by other
interactions.
The high specificity for 2⬘-deoxyribonucleosides is consistent
with the tight interactions at the 2⬘-carbon. Binding of ribonucleosides would cause steric interference among the 2⬘-OH
and the carbonyl of the conserved Gly and the ring of the
conserved Tyr in the lasso domain, because both residues are in
van der Waals contact with the 2⬘-carbon. The 3⬘-OH interactions with the main-chain atoms of a conserved Gly in the lasso
domain take part such that one side of the 3⬘-OH is exposed at
the surface and thus tolerates substitutions. 3⬘-azido-3⬘deoxythymidine is an example of such an analog modified in this
position (11, 12).
TK1 and Drug Design. The high conservation of the dT-binding site

Fig. 3. Binding interactions of dTTP at the active site as found in hTK1. (A)
The active-site amino acids are well conserved; only the residues that differ in
Uu-TK are in brackets. The hydrogen-bond donors and acceptors of the base
all form hydrogen bonds to main-chain atoms: O2 and N3 bond to main-chain
atoms of the lasso loop, and O4 bonds to main-chain nitrogen of the ␣兾␤domain. The methyl group of thymine is positioned in a hydrophobic pocket
directed toward the ␤-carbon of a Ser in Uu-TK and a Thr in hTK1 surrounded
by Met, Leu, and Tyr. The 3⬘-oxygen atom of the deoxyribose is hydrogenbonded to the amino group of a conserved Gly in the lasso domain and to the
side chain of the conserved Asp in the flexible loop of the ␣兾␤-domain. (B)
Comparison of hTK1 and Dm-dNK with dTTP. hTK1 (brown) was superimposed
with Dm-dNK bound with dTTP (light green). The P loop and the flanking
regions were used in the superpositioning. (C) The thymidine base in hTK1 is
bound perpendicularly compared with the way it is bound in Dm-dNK. dT and
the sulfate ion bound to Dm-dNK are shown in black, dTTP bound to hTK1 is
shown in brown, and dTTP bound to Dm-dNK is shown in light green.

domain and to the side chain of the conserved Asp in the
f lexible loop of the ␣兾␤-domain. The 5⬘-oxygen of the deoxyribose is close to a Glu in the ␣兾␤ domain. This Glu (Glu-98

with main-chain atoms makes selective drug development difficult, because there is little variation in the substrate cleft among
different species. To create new prodrugs that could be selectively phosphorylated by Uu-TK but not hTK1, there are possibilities around the 5-methyl group of dT, where there is contact
with the ␤-carbon of a Thr in hTK1 and of a Ser in Uu-TK.
Otherwise, substitutions at N3 that have been show to be useful
can be exploited further.
The environment of the deoxyribose is rather open around
the 3⬘– 4⬘ edge and may be used in the development of new
prodrugs. An alternative is substitutions at O4⬘ of the ring,
which is ⬇4.5 Å from the conserved Gln-100 (human sequence
numbering).
In gene therapy using viral TK, it was observed that some
patients developed an immune response against the viral enzyme
during the treatment (57). Gene therapy with hTK1 with modified specificity may circumvent the immunity problem. The two
TK structures also will aid development of new immunological
reagents for cell biology and cancer diagnostics.
