The eukaryotic CMG (Cdc45, Mcm2–7, GINS) helicase consists of the
Mcm2–7 hexameric ring along with five accessory factors. The
Mcm2–7 heterohexamer, like other hexameric helicases, is shaped
like a ring with two tiers, an N-tier ring composed of the N-terminal
domains, and a C-tier of C-terminal domains; the C-tier contains the
motor. In principle, either tier could translocate ahead of the other
during movement on DNA. We have used cryo-EM single-particle 3D
reconstruction to solve the structure of CMG in complex with a DNA
fork. The duplex stem penetrates into the central channel of the
N-tier and the unwound leading single-strand DNA traverses the
channel through the N-tier into the C-tier motor, 5′-3′ through
CMG. Therefore, the N-tier ring is pushed ahead by the C-tier ring
during CMG translocation, opposite the currently accepted polarity.
The polarity of the N-tier ahead of the C-tier places the leading Pol e
below CMG and Pol α-primase at the top of CMG at the replication
fork. Surprisingly, the new N-tier to C-tier polarity of translocation
reveals an unforeseen quality-control mechanism at the origin.
Thus, upon assembly of head-to-head CMGs that encircle doublestranded DNA at the origin, the two CMGs must pass one another to
leave the origin and both must remodel onto opposite strands of
single-stranded DNA to do so. We propose that head-to-head motors may generate energy that underlies initial melting at the origin.
CMG helicase
replisome

Escherichia coli DnaB, phage T4, and phage T7 replicative helicases
(SF4), the bacterial Rho transcriptional terminator (SF5), and archaeal minichromosome maintenance (MCM) and eukaryotic
Mcm2–7 (SF6). The current report examines CMG helicase
from Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
Hexameric helicases are sculpted from dumbbell-shaped subunits with an N-terminal domain (NTD) and a C-terminal domain
(CTD) that give the hexamer the appearance of two stacked rings
that we refer to here as the N-tier ring and C-tier ring (1, 3). The
CTD contains the ATP sites and this domain is the motor that
drives translocation and DNA unwinding. It is generally accepted
that hexameric helicases unwind DNA by the strand-exclusion
model in which the helicase encircles and translocates along one
strand while sterically excluding the other strand (1, 3, 11).
High-resolution crystal structures of helicases are essential to
understand how translocation occurs, yet none have been crystallized with a replication fork, and only three have been crystalized with a ssDNA substrate. These structures include BPV E1
Significance
All cellular life forms use a ring-shaped hexameric helicase
during DNA replication. CMG (Cdc45, Mcm2–7, GINS) is the
eukaryotic replicative helicase. CMG contains the ring-shaped
hexameric Mcm2–7 that harbors the helicase motors. CMG is
known to bind many other proteins, including a leading and
lagging polymerase and primase. Thus, the threading of DNA
through the CMG helicase at a replication fork determines the
orientation of the associated polymerases at the replication
fork, an important structural feature with many consequences
that may direct future experimentation. This report uses cryoEM single-particle reconstruction to image CMG that motored
to a block site at a forked junction, enabling direct visualization
of DNA threading through CMG.

eplicative helicases are hexameric rings in all domains of life
(1–3). In bacteria and archaea, the replicative helicase is a
homohexamer and encircles single-strand (ss) DNA at a replication fork. Some viral and phage replicative helicases are also
ring-shaped hexamers, including bovine papilloma virus (BPV)
E1, simian virus 40 (SV40) large T-antigen (T-Ag), and the T4
and T7 phage helicases. Unlike other replicative helicases, the
eukaryotic replicative Mcm2–7 helicase is composed of six nonidentical but homologous Mcm subunits that become activated
upon assembly with five accessory factors (Cdc45 and GINS
tetramer) to form the 11-subunit CMG (Cdc45, Mcm2–7, GINS)
(4–6). Numerous studies have outlined the process that forms
CMG at origins in which the Mcm2–7 heterohexamer is loaded
onto DNA as an inactive double hexamer in G1 phase, and
becomes activated in S phase by several initiation proteins and
cell-cycle kinases that assemble Cdc45 and GINS onto Mcm2–7
to form the active CMG helicases (7–9).
Helicases assort into six superfamilies (SF1–SF6) based on
sequence alignments (10). The SF1 and SF2 helicases are generally monomeric and the SF3–SF6 helicases are hexameric rings
used in DNA replication and other processes. The bacterial SF4
and SF5 helicases contain RecA-based motors and translocate
5′-3′, whereas the eukarytic SF3 and SF6 helicases contain AAA+
(ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities)-based motors
and translocate 3′-5′ (3, 10). Examples of well-studied hexameric
helicases include the viral BPV E1 and SV40 T-Ag (SF3),

(12), Rho (3), and DnaB (13), representatives of SF3, SF5, and
SF4 helicases, respectively. The polarity of DNA relative to the
ATP sites is informative. In all hexameric helicases studied to
date, the ATP sites are located at subunit interfaces and use
residues from both subunits (e.g., P-loop ATP binding site in
one, and arginine finger in the neighbor) (1, 3, 14). Interestingly,
the ssDNA binds the C-tier motors of BPV E1, E. coli Rho, and
E. coli DnaB in the same direction, such that when viewed 3′-5′
along DNA, the P-loops are clockwise to the neighboring arginine finger (Fig. 1), yet they translocate on DNA in opposite
directions (3). Hence, in BPV E1 helicase the N-tier is pushed
from behind by the C-tier motor, whereas in Rho and DnaB the
C-tier motor is in front and pulls the N-tier ring behind during
translocation (3, 12, 13). The object of this report is to determine
whether the DNA orientation through the N-tier and C-tier rings
of CMG is different or similar to the hexameric helicases of
other superfamilies.
The archaeal MCM and eukaryotic Mcm2–7 of CMG are in the
SF6 class and translocate 3′-5′ along the leading-strand template.
High-resolution studies of MCM and CMG bound to their DNA
substrates are lacking, but a negative-stain EM study of a streptavidin (SA)-tipped partial duplex bound to Drosophila melanogaster CMG (15), and FRET studies of an archaeal MCM (16),
indicate that the C-tier is ahead and pulls the N-tier ring behind
during translocation. This DNA orientation requires the DNA to
pass through the helicase in the opposite direction compared with
the SF3, SF4, and SF5 hexameric helicases. The Mcm SF6 class
might bind DNA opposite to the other superfamilies, but we
reexamined this herein because CMG is a central scaffold for
replisome factors and the way DNA threads through CMG has
important consequences for the orientation of proteins at a replication fork. In this report, we solved the structure of S. cerevisiae
CMG bound to forked DNA by cryo-EM single-particle reconstruction. To our knowledge, this report is unique in visualizing
a replicative helicase bound to a forked junction using a high-

subunit interfaces in both the bacterial RecA-based motors and eukaryotic
AAA+ motors. ATP signifies the Walker A site and R signifies the arginine
finger. Crystal structure analysis of BPV E1 (12), E. coli DnaB (13), and E. coli
Rho (3), members of the SF3, -4, and -5 superfamilies, respectively, show that
DNA binds the motors in similar fashion, illustrated here by looking down
the DNA axis from the 3′ terminus, and into the motors from the C-surface
view; the P loops lie clockwise to the arginine finger.

resolution technique. The results reveal that DNA traverses CMG
5′-3′ along the axis from the N-tier to the C-tier, and therefore
DNA polarity through CMG is the same as determined for the
other hexameric helicase superfamilies. Consistent with the 3′-5′
direction of translocation of CMG, the N-tier is first to reach the
forked junction, followed by the C-tier. Our earlier work demonstrated that Pol e binds the C-tier of CMG and Pol α-primase
binds the N-tier (17). The new DNA orientation reverses our
previous proposal of replisome architecture (17) that was based on
the opposite DNA polarity through the D. melanogaster CMG and
the archaeal MCM (15, 16). The N-tier ahead of the C-tier during
CMG translocation has profound implications, not only for the
replisome architecture but also for origin initiation. These implications are presented in Discussion.
Results
The CMG–ssDNA Complex. To analyze whether the C-tier precedes

the NTD during translocation of CMG, we initially assembled
CMG onto a synthetic DNA fork containing a 25-mer doublestranded DNA (dsDNA) stem, a leading ssDNA 3′ dT40 tail, and a
16-mer 5′ (CCGA)4 ssDNA tail. The (CCGA)4 sequence was used
for the lagging strand because CMG does not bind this sequence,
whereas CMG binding to dT40 is readily apparent (18). CMG was
mixed with a 4.2-fold molar excess of DNA fork and 0.2 mM
Adenylylimidodiphosphate (AMPPNP) followed by gel filtration to
remove excess DNA (SI Appendix, Fig. S1). Purified CMG–DNA–
AMPPNP was analyzed by cryo-EM single-particle 3D reconstruction which yielded a 4.9-Å structure of CMG–DNA containing 14 nucleotides of ssDNA and 3 molecules of AMPPNP,
referred to here as CMG–ssDNA (Fig. 2 and SI Appendix, Figs.
S2–S4 and Table S1). CMG is known to act on the leading strand,
but the forked junction was not visible. We presume that AMPPNP
does not support CMG translocation to the forked junction. ATP
would enable CMG to reach the fork, but then CMG would destroy the duplex by unwinding it. We devise a strategy later in this
report that enables use of ATP without unwinding DNA and directly visualize CMG bound to a forked junction.
Six of the 14 nucleotides of ssDNA in CMG extend through the
central channel of the N-tier ring in an approximately linear fashion
and interact with loops of the (oligonucleotide/oligosaccharidebinding) OB folds in Mcm4 and Mcm7 (Fig. 2). The linear ssDNA
passes through and binds to a narrow gap between the two upper
OB loops (loop #2, between β-strands 3 and 4 of the OB domain)
of Mcm7 and Mcm4 (SI Appendix, Fig. S4A). These loops are
distinct from the lower OB-fold loops (loop #1, between β-strands
1 and 2 of the OB domain) that bind ssDNA perpendicular to the
channel in an archaeal MCM N-tier (19). Importantly, the upper
OB loops of Mcm4 and Mcm7 are well ordered even in the apo
CMG structure, and they are the only two main projections into the
central channel (see figure 1 C and E of ref. 20). The remaining
eight nucleotides proceed into the C-tier motor ring and assume a
right-handed B-form spiral, through interaction with the DNAbinding presensor-1 (PS1) and Helix-2 insertion (H2I) β-hairpin
loops of Mcm subunits 3, 5, 2, and 6 (Fig. 2 and SI Appendix, Fig.
S4B). A cryo-EM study of D. melanogaster CMG–DNA–ATPγS at
7–9.8 Å observed no nucletides in the N-tier but six nucleotides in
the C-tier proximal to Mcm 7, 4, and 6, which are positioned on the
opposite side of the AAA+ central channel (21). Superimposition
of the S. cerevisiae CMG–AMPPNP–ssDNA and D. melanogaster
CMG–ATPγS–ssDNA models, made by aligning the CTDs of
Mcm6 and Mcm4, reveals that the ssDNA in these two models
appear to belong to the same (leading) strand and are both in the
B-form–like spiral (SI Appendix, Fig. S5). This observation indicates
that the CTDs of all six Mcm proteins bind the leading strand
during translocation, but DNA binding to particular subunits may
be at different stages of the nucleotide cycle.
We also obtained a 6.2-Å structure of CMG–ssDNA containing
only nine nucleotides of ssDNA, located mostly inside the N-tier

ring (Fig. 2B). The 9-mer has the same conformation as the initial
nine bases in the 14-mer CMG–ssDNA structure, revealing that
ssDNA is held in a specific linear orientation along the axis of the
central channel in the N-tier independent of DNA contacts to the
C-tier. Assuming CMG threads onto the 3′ end of the leadingstrand template (i.e., the known translocation strand of CMG),
the 9-mer and 14-mer structures hint that the 3′ terminus first
enters the N-tier ring (i.e., CMG–9-mer DNA) and then wiggles
its way into the C-tier ring to produce the CMG–14-mer DNA
structure. This is, in fact, the direction DNA threads into CMG, as
is described later in this report.
ATP Site Occupancy. The 4.9-Å CMG–ssDNA structure provided
sufficient resolution to determine ATP site occupancy (Fig. 3).
Georgescu et al.

Interestingly, only three of the six ATP sites in the CMG–DNA
structure contain a bound nucleotide (the Mcm2/3, Mcm2/5, and
Mcm5/6 sites), indicating that these consecutive ATP sites have
the highest affinity for nucleotide. Interestingly, the subunits that
comprise these sites are the same subunits that also bind the
ssDNA. Hence, binding of a nucleotide to a subunit correlates
with subunit binding to ssDNA. Two of these nucleotide-bound
sites (Mcm2/3 and Mcm2/5) correspond to the two sites that are
most required for helicase activity determined by mutagenesis of
D. melanogaster CMG (5).
Our earlier cryo-EM study of apo CMG revealed two conformers, a compact conformer in which the C-tier ring is parallel
to the N-tier ring, and an extended conformer in which the C-tier
ring is tilted relative to the N-tier ring, thus extending the length

that the WHD domains no longer occlude the central channel (Fig.
4 A and B and SI Appendix, Fig. S6). The CMG–ssDNA structure
shows a very different configuration of the WHD modules, and
indicates that upon ssDNA binding, the Mcm5–WHD moves out
of the central channel and becomes disordered, the Mcm6–WHD
moves backward and away from the channel, and the Mcm4–WHD
now partially occludes the channel opening. These changes make
it likely that CMG can encircle dsDNA, consistent with reports demonstrating that Mcm2–7 matures into two fully assembled CMGs on
dsDNA before origin DNA unwinding occurs (22–25).
Superpositioning the apo CMG with the CMG–ssDNA suggests
that when ssDNA binds to CMG, the complete C-tier AAA+ ring
of Mcm2–7 makes a horizontal movement toward the Cdc45 side
of CMG by ∼15 Å, whereas the N-tier ring of Mcm2–7, and the
GINS/Cdc45 do not move (Fig. 4C and Movies S1 and S2). We do
not know the significance, if any, of this conformation change to
CMG activity.

of the central channel (20). It was proposed that the Mcm2/5
interface, known to open during Mcm2–7 loading onto the origin
DNA, is closed and bound to nucleotide in the compact state.
The CMG–ssDNA structure described herein is in the compact
state (Figs. 2 and 3), consistent with nucleotide binding to the
Mcm2/5 interface.
Conformation Changes of CMG Upon Binding ssDNA/AMPPNP. Our

previous apoenzyme structure of CMG showed that the C-terminal
winged helix domain (WHD) of Mcm5 occluded part of the central
channel and was pinned in the channel by the WHD of Mcm6,
restricting the central channel to a width that could only accommodate ssDNA (20). However, the CMG–ssDNA structure shows

Comparison of ssDNA-Bound CMG to Other Hexameric Helicases. BPV
E1 contains AAA+ motors with conserved PS1 and H2I β-hairpin
loops that bind ssDNA, and both Rho and DnaB also have loops
in the C-tier that bind DNA (SI Appendix, Fig. S7) (3, 12, 13). In
each case, the ssDNA is configured into a right-handed spiral.
However, only in the CMG and the DnaB helicases is the ssDNA in
the dsDNA-like B form; the central channels of Rho and E1 hexamers are too small for the ssDNA to assume the canonical B-form.
A noteworthy difference between CMG and the E1 and Rho helicases is that the C-tier of CMG binds eight nucleotides using only
four subunits, whereas all six subunits of E1 and Rho bind a total of
six bases of ssDNA (3, 12). The six motor domains of DnaB bind 12
nucleotides (13). It is presumed that these lengths correspond to
the step size, 2 bp/ATP for DnaB and 1 bp/ATP for E1 and Rho.
The DNA binding loops in E1 and Rho either point up or down
relative to the axis of the central channel depending on the nucleotide bound state (3, 12). With ATP bound, the loops point up,
against the direction of translocation, whereas in ADP and apo
sites, the loops progressively position “downward.” The loop
movements are due to a rotation of the domain to which the loop
is attached and are proposed to move DNA through the central
channel during ATP hydrolysis (12). The DNA binding loops of
Mcm3, -5, -2, and -6 that interact with DNA in the CMG–ssDNA
structure point upward relative to the central axis, and would
move ssDNA in the 3′-5′ direction if they changed conformation
to a “down” position. The DNA loops of Mcm subunits 4 and 7
are well ordered, and they do not bind DNA in our structure.
However, they interact with the ssDNA in the cryo-EM structure
of D. melanogaster CMG determined in the presence of ATPγS at
7.4-Å resolution (SI Appendix, Fig. S5) (21). Therefore, all six
Mcm proteins are capable of binding the ssDNA in the C-tier
motor ring, and together they bind 12 bases (i.e., one subunit binds
two bases). This one-protein–two-nucleotide stoichiometry is the
same as in the DnaB hexamer (13). However, a conformational
change is likely required in order for Mcm4 and Mcm7 in the
S. cerevisiae CMG to interact with DNA, perhaps in a different
nucleotide state. We should note that our earlier cryo-EM analysis
of CMG suggested that it functions as an inchworm ratchet during
translocation, and this process may not require the loops to move;
instead the C- and N-tiers move relative to one another during
translocation (20). Clearly further studies are required to understand the translocation mechanism of CMG.
DNA Nanopointers Suggest the Polarity of ssDNA Binding to CMG.

The resolution of CMG–ssDNA was insufficient to determine
the polarity of the ssDNA chain within CMG, although this can
be deduced from the CMG–forked DNA structure later in this
report. As another means to assess the direction that DNA
proceeds through CMG, we used nanopointer 20-mer dT oligonucleotides with SA bound to biotin at either the 3′ or 5′ end.
Georgescu et al.

PNAS PLUS

This strategy was used in the study of D. melanogaster CMG,
except the DNA was a partial duplex (15). In side view, the
N-tier and C-tier of CMG are easily recognized. The SA bound
to the 3′ biotinylated 20-mer nanopointer gave 2D averages of
CMG side views having visible SA density only on the C-tier side
of CMG (Fig. 5A). Because the 3′ biotin is covered by the SA, it
cannot enter CMG, and therefore this result indicates that the 5′
terminus of DNA enters the C-tier ring. The SA bound to the 5′
biotinylated 20-mer nanopointer provided 2D averages of CMG
side views with the SA density only on the N-tier side of CMG
(Fig. 5B). The observation that the 3′ and 5′ biotinylated
nanopointers bind opposite faces of CMG supports the expectation that DNA binds CMG with a preferred polarity. We also
used a partial duplex having the same sequence as used in the
D. melanogaster CMG study (15). This DNA has a 3′ 40-mer
ssDNA of dT residues and a 20-mer duplex containing a biotin–
SA conjugate. The side views showed the SA only on the N-tier
side of CMG, and the extra distance of the SA from the CMG is
likely due to the length of the rigid 20-mer duplex (Fig. 5C).
Although this result is consistent with the 20-mer ssDNA
nanopointers, we note that the nanopointer technique indicates
that the DNA orientation through S. cerevisiae CMG is opposite
that of D. melanogaster CMG. Therefore, we were unsure whether
results using nanopointers can provide a faithful representation of
DNA polarity through CMG, and we applied a different method
to image CMG at a true replication fork.
Georgescu et al.

Cryo-EM of CMG on a DNA Forked Junction. To directly visualize
CMG at a forked DNA junction, we used ATP to allow CMG to
translocate, and blocked CMG from unwinding the forked DNA
by using two SA-biotin blocks on the duplex stem as illustrated in
Fig. 6A. A dual SA block was sufficient to block forks in Xenopus
extracts (11). SA was prebound to DNA, then CMG was added
along with ATP for 6 min before cryo-grid preparation. The 2D
class averages revealed the SA blocks as a diffuse intensity just
above the N-tier of CMG (Fig. 6B). The 3D reconstruction produced a 6.2-Å structure, revealing CMG bound to the forked
junction (Fig. 6C and SI Appendix, Figs. S8–S10). As expected
from the experiments of Fig. 5 using 20-mer nanopointers, the
N-tier ring faces the forked junction and the C-tier ring is behind
the N-tier ring. dsDNA is tilted by 28° from the Mcm2–7 channel
axis. Interestingly, dsDNA slightly enters the N-tier ring, followed
by unwound ssDNA that traverses the central channel of the N-tier
and C-tier rings (Figs. 6C and 7). The major and minor grooves of
the duplex are clearly visible (Figs. 6 and 7 and SI Appendix, Fig.
S8), thereby identifying the 3′ and 5′ ends, and that the ssDNA that
proceeds down the central channel of CMG has a 5′-3′ polarity,
consistent with the known translocation directionality of CMG.
Superposition of the CMG–fork DNA structure with the CMG–
ssDNA structure shows very little change in conformation (SI
Appendix, Figs. S11 and S12), and the ssDNA 14-mer aligns nicely
to the forked DNA (SI Appendix, Fig. S13). This polarity is also
consistent with the known translocation direction of CMG. The
same three ATP sites are filled as in the CMG–ssDNA structure,

Fig. 4. DNA binding to the apo CMG causes a rearrangement of the WHDs that opens up the C-tier channel, and a major shift of the C-tier AAA+ ring toward
the Cdc45 side, whereas the N-tier ring stays stationary. (A) The apo enzyme of CMG contained the WHD of Mcm5 inside the central channel, pinned there by the
WHD of Mcm6. The Mcm4 WHD was not visualized in the apo structure (20); its location is marked by a magenta oval based on the double hexamer structure
(57). (B) The CMG–ssDNA–AMPPNP structure. The orange arrows in A indicate that, upon ssDNA binding, the Mcm5–WHD moves out of the C-tier channel and
becomes disordered, Mcm6–WHD moves back and away from the channel. The large void previously occupied by Mcm5–WHD and Mcm6–WHD is now partially
occupied by Mcm4–WHD. The dashed red spiral in B indicates that the B-form ssDNA exits the C-tier ring unobstructed. (C) When ssDNA binds to the apo CMG
helicase, the entire C-tier AAA+ ring of Mcm2–7 moves horizontally by about 15 Å toward the Cdc45 side (Left), but the N-tier ring does not move (Right).

speculate that this loop, and possibly together with the upper
OB loop of Mcm4, may facilitate DNA unwinding, or may act
to prevent both strands of a DNA fork from entering into the
central channel. However, definitive conclusions about the exact

although the resolution cannot distinguish whether bound nucleotide is ATP, ADP, or a mixture (SI Appendix, Fig. S14). Given
that the forked junction was not visualized in the CMG–ssDNA
structure using AMPPNP, we presume the ATP was required for
CMG to translocate along the leading-strand template to reach the
forked junction. The presence of SA is reported to stop CMG
about 10 bp before the biotinylated nucleotide (11), and therefore
CMG may have unwound about 5 bp before being blocked.
However, dsDNA near the SA blocks is not clearly visualized and
we cannot be sure how many base pairs, if any, have become unwound. The lagging-strand template is not visible in the 3D reconstruction and therefore we assume it is too mobile to visualize
by these methods. Because the dsDNA is tilted and enters the
N-tier ring of CMG at a glancing angle, it seems likely that the
unwound lagging strand will emerge from the central channel, and
might pass through a gap between the Zn finger (ZF) domains of
Mcm3 and Mcm5 to reach the nearby Pol α-primase (17).
The duplex stem of the forked junction is partially buried by
the six ZF domains in the central channel of the N-tier and the
upper loop of the OB-fold of Mcm7 appears to bind at the forked
junction (Fig. 7C and SI Appendix, Fig. S13). It is tempting to

hydrolysis by using the nonhydrolysable AMPPNP, CMG is able to load
itself onto the leading strand, but is unable to translocate to the fork

and 9-base ssDNA as shown in Figs. 2–4. However, in the presence of ATP
hydrolysis, CMG moves to the junction and unwinds the double strand
until it hits the dual SA blocks (Right). (B) Comparison of cryo-EM 2D class

role of the N-tier in helicase mechanism will require higher resolution to identify candidate-specific amino acid residues, followed by direct mutagenesis and biochemical characterization.
The CMG–forked DNA structure agrees with conclusions derived using 20-mer nanopointers, and both results demonstrate
that DNA lies 5′-3′ along CMG when viewed from the N-tier to
the C-tier. This DNA orientation is the same as observed in crystal
structures of ssDNA bound to BPV E1 (SF3) (12), E. coli DnaB
(SF4) (13), and E. coli Rho (SF5) (3). The result indicates that all
four superfamilies of hexameric helicases bind DNA with the
same polarity. Given the opposite directions of helicase with
AAA+ and RecA motors, eukaryotic E1 and S. cerevisiae CMG
AAA+ helicases translocate with the N-tier ring ahead and the
C-tier motor behind, and bacterial RecA based helicases, E. coli
Rho and DnaB, translocate 5′-3′, with the C-tier motor ahead of
the N-tier ring.
Discussion
In principle, the 3′-5′ translocation of CMG could proceed with
the C-tier motor ring ahead of the N-tier ring, or the other way
around, with the N-tier ring ahead of the C-tier motor ring. This
report determines that the C-tier ring follows the N-tier ring
during translocation of S. cerevisiae CMG on DNA. The orientation of the N-tier and C-tier during translocation has important
biological consequences, discussed below.
Implications of N-Tier Before C-Tier to Replisome Architecture. We
previously demonstrated that Pol e and Pol α-primase bind opposite sides of S. cerevisiae CMG, with Pol e on the C-tier side of
CMG and Pol α-primase on the N-tier side of CMG (17). Earlier
Georgescu et al.

reports identified the C-tier ring of D. melanogaster CMG is ahead
of the N-tier during translocation (15), consistent with FRET
studies of an archaeal MCM (16). Given these earlier findings, we
initially proposed Pol e is on the leading face of S. cerevisiae CMG
(i.e., because Pol e binds the C-tier of CMG) and Pol α-primase
below (17). The present study demonstrates that the DNA orientation in S. cerevisiae CMG is opposite that reported for
D. melanogaster CMG. It is possible the two CMGs bind DNA in
opposite orientations, or that DNA nanopointers do not faithfully
represent DNA orientation for all CMGs and one must obtain
structures of CMG at a DNA fork to determine the N-tier and
C-tier orientation on DNA. The direction of DNA through
S. cerevisiae CMG generalizes to the orientation of DNA through
the hexameric helicase–ssDNA complexes of the SF3, -4, and -5
helicases solved by crystal structure analysis (i.e., Fig. 1) (3, 12, 13).
The finding that the N-tier ring leads the C-tier ring during DNA
translocation by S. cerevisiae CMG informs a revised architecture
of the replisome at the fork (explained below).
The new polarity of S. cerevisiae CMG on DNA, along with
previously established structural information of S. cerevisiae CMG
binding other replisome proteins, predicts a replisome architecture illustrated in Fig. 8A. The present report reveals that the 3′
end of DNA enters the N-tier of S. cerevisiae CMG, and this DNA
threading places Pol e at the “bottom” of CMG, where it can
extend the leading strand immediately as the unwound DNA
emerges from CMG. The new DNA threading places Pol α-primase
at the top of the fork near the unwound lagging strand, a strategic
position for immediate priming of the lagging-strand ssDNA
template.

Fig. 8. Implications of the N-tier ahead of C-tier direction of DNA translocation by CMG. (A) CMG in side view binds Pol α-primase and the Ctf4 trimer at the
N-tier face, and the Pol e is located on the C-tier AAA+ face. Given that the N-tier of CMG translocates ahead of the C-tier, the lagging strand is unwound from
the leading strand at the N-tier, and excluded from the central channel, placing the lagging strand adjacent to Pol α-primase for immediate priming. Pol e is
positioned on the C-tier, below the helicase to immediately extend the leading-strand 3′ terminus upon exit from CMG. The Pol e catalytic domain is in the
NTD of Pol2 which has been proposed to be attached to the CTD of Pol e by a flexible tether (see text for details) (17, 26, 27). This may allow the catalytic Pol e
NTD to transiently release the leading strand while remaining attached to CMG, exposing the leading 3′ terminus to RFC (or other proteins) for loading
additional PCNA needed for Caf1-mediated nucleosome assembly and mismatch repair of the leading strand. (B) At the origin of initiation, two head-to-head
CMGs are assembled around the duplex DNA (Top). Given the N-tier followed by the C-tier translocation polarity, the CMGs move toward one another, but
are blocked when encircling dsDNA. Each CMG must transition to encircle ssDNA (Middle) to motor past one another and form bidirectional replication forks
(Bottom).

A clear advantage of DNA threading 3′ into the N-tier of CMG,
combined with the known Pol e and Pol α-primase attachments to
CMG, is that the amount of ssDNA exposed during replication is
vastly minimized (i.e., discussed and compared in refs. 26 and 27).
Additionally, threading 3′ DNA into the N-tier places the N-terminal Mcm2 histone binding motif in front of the fork, where it
may interact with a parental H3–H4 tetramer (28, 29). This new
arrangement, with the lagging machinery on top of the fork, may
give an advantage to the lagging strand in inheriting parental
nucleosomes and their epigenetic marks. It will be interesting to
determine whether the spatial arrangement of the lagging-strand
machinery relative to CMG plays a role in the inheritance of parental epigenetic marks on nucleosomes that favors the laggingstrand DNA compared with the leading strand.
Implications of N-Tier Ahead of C-Tier During CMG Translocation to
Genome Integrity. The POL2 gene of Pol e consists of two

halves: the N-half encodes the active polymerase and the C-half
comprises an inactive polymerase (30). The C-half of POL2 is
essential to cell viability and binds the accessory factors Dpb2, -3,
and -4, whereas the active N-terminal polymerase encoded by
POL2 is not essential, although cells are severely compromised in
S-phase progression (31–33). Our earlier chemical cross-linking
MS study showed that the N- and C-halves of Pol2 each have
numerous internal cross-links, yet there is only one cross-link between the two halves of Pol2, suggesting the N- and C-halves of
Pol2 are distinct folding units connected by a linker region that
separates them spatially (SI Appendix, Fig. S15A) (17). Flexible
domains within Pol e were also observed in an early cryo-EM study
of Pol e (34) and is seen in 2D averages of Pol e (SI Appendix, Fig.
S15C). We noted earlier that the catalytic NTD of Pol2 may be
mobile and averaged out in the CMG–Pol e 3D reconstruction,
E704 | www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1620500114

thus explaining the noted loss of about 30% of the expected volume of Pol e in CMG–Pol e, as suggested previously (17, 26, 27).
The illustration in Fig. 8A suggests how a mobile catalytic domain of Pol e may enable dynamic on/off action on the leading 3′
terminus. Specifically, the catalytic NTD of Pol2 may grip the
leading 3′ terminus as it extrudes from CMG, and could periodically dissociate from the leading-strand 3′ terminus yet remain
bound to the replisome through connection to the CTD of Pol e
that firmly binds CMG. This proposed dynamic action of Pol e on/off
DNA would provide access of other polymerases or replication
factor C (RFC) to the leading 3′ terminus. Access of the RFC
clamp loader to the leading 3′ terminus could be important to
genomic integrity because it may enable loading of multiple proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) clamps, thereby explaining
how the leading strand may become populated with PCNA. PCNA
is required for mismatch repair (35, 36) and PCNA clamps are also
required by Caf1 and Hir, nucleosome assembly factors that require PCNA for assembly of new nucleosomes on DNA (37, 38).
The CMG N-Tier/C-Tier Polarity on DNA Provides an Unrecognized
Quality Control Mechanism at the Origin. Translocation of CMG

along DNA with the C-tier motors pushing the N-tier ring ahead
has important implications for the mechanism of initiation at
origins. The Mcm2–7 double hexamer is oriented head-to-head
(N terminus to N terminus) in the PreRC during the G1 phase. In
the S phase the Mcm2–7 double hexamer matures into head-tohead CMGs at the origin before ssDNA is generated (22–25). The
two CMGs at the origin eventually separate because individual
replication forks contain just one CMG (39, 40). If the C-tier moved
ahead of the N-tier during CMG translocation, the head-to-head
CMGs could simply motor away from one another in opposite directions, the current prevailing view. However, we demonstrate
herein that the C-tier motor rings push the N-tier rings of CMG

DNA Sequences. DNA oligos were synthesized by IDT: (i) The replication fork (41/
65-Tamn fork) was obtained upon annealing equimolar amounts of: a 41-mer
lagging-strand oligo, (5′/5Biosg/GGCAGGCAGGCAGGCACACACTCTCCAATTCTCACTTCCTA -3′) and a 65-mer leading-strand oligo (5′/56TAMN/TAGGAAGTGAGAATTGGAGAGTGTGTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT*T*T*T*T*T-3′).
(ii) The SA-dual blocked fork was obtained upon annealing equimolar amounts
of: a 45-mer lagging-strand oligo, (5′-GGCAGGCAGGCAGGCACACACTCTCCAATTA/iBiodT/CACTTCCTACTCTA-3′) and a 70-mer leading-strand oligo (5′/5Cy3/
TAGAGTAGGAAGTGA/iBiodT/AATTGGAGAGTGTGTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT*T*T*T*T*T-3′).
Preparation of CMG–DNA–AMPPNP Samples for Cryo-EM. Sixty-five microliters
of 4.5 mg/mL CMG (380 pmols) freshly dialyzed in 300 mM NaCl, 10% (vol/vol)
glycerol, 40 mM Tris-acetate pH7.5, 2 mM DTT, 2 mM Mg acetate, was mixed
with 8 μL 41/65-Tamn fork (1,600 pmols); the CMG:DNA mix was further
dialyzed in two steps: (i) 5% (vol/vol) glycerol/150 mM K-glutamate, then (ii)
2% (vol/vol) glycerol/50 mM K-glutamate in 25 mM Tris-acetate buffer
pH 7.5, 2 mM Mg acetate, and 1 mM DTT. Both buffers contained 0.2 mM
AMPPNP. After the second dialysis step, 70 μL of 3.2 mg/mL CMG:DNA was
injected onto a Superose 6 Increase 3.2/300 (GE) gel-filtration column
equilibrated in the second dialysis buffer without the glycerol. The complex
separation was monitored at 260 nm, 280 nm, and 555 nm. Approximately
40-μL fractions were collected, analyzed on an SDS/PAGE gel [6% (wt/vol)
polyacrylamide], and the CMG–DNA complex peak fractions were used for
the preparation of cryo-grids.
Preparation of CMG-Blocked Fork DNA-ATP Samples for Cryo-EM. Proteins were
freshly dialyzed to remove the glycerol to less than 0.5% (verified with an
Abbé refractometer). Thirteen microliters of 1.05 mg/mL CMG in 20 mM Trisacetate pH 7.5, 40 mM K-glutamate, 40 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, and 2 mM Mg
acetate was mixed with 2 μL of 10 μM 45-Bio/70-Bio,Cy3 previously blocked
with monovalent SA. The sample was incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Three microliters of the CMG:blocked fork was then incubated
with 0.5 μL 1 mM ATP for 5 min at room temperature and immediately
applied to grids.
Nanopointer Detection by Negative-Stain EM. First, 2 μL of 1.65 μM of CMG
was combined with 2 μL of 2.2 μM 20-mer ssDNA-biotin and incubated 5 min
at room temperature. Then, 2 μL of 2.2 μM of monovalent SA was added and
incubated an additional 5 min. We diluted the solution to 0.09 mg/mL and
applied a 4-μL sample to a glow-discharged, carbon-coated copper grid
and waited for 30 s. We blotted the excess sample with a piece of filter
paper, added 2 μL of 2% (wt/vol) uranyl acetate aqueous solution, waited
30 s, blotted the excess stain, and repeated the stain application, leaving a
very thin layer of stain solution to air dry. For the tailed dsDNA, we PAGEpurified the 20:60-mer hybrid using the same sequences as described previously (15); the staining procedure was the same as for the 20-mer ssDNAs.
We recorded images either in a JEOL 2010F transmission electron microscope
(200 kV) equipped with a Gatan 4k-by-4k CCD camera or in an FEI Tecnai
Spirit (120 kV) equipped with an FEI Eagle 4k-by-4k CCD camera. Each dataset
had between 200 and 300 micrographs, with at least 170,000 particles per
dataset. Particle picking used either Swarm or Gaussian autopicking in
EMAN2.1 (43), and exported the coordinate files to RELION 1.4 or RELION
2.0 (44). CTF calculations were performed using Gctf 1.06 (45), and the
particles were binned 2× or 4× to speed up 2D classification. Finally, side
views in which the SA label was clearly seen were selected for further 2D

classification. Of a total of 29,423 particles in the side views of the dataset
containing the 3′ biotin-labeled 20-mer dT ssDNA, 1,856 particles had clearly
labeled SA (6.3%). The 20-mer dT ssDNA-5′SA dataset had 4,091 labeled particles
of a total of 19,281 side view particles (21.2%). In the tailed dsDNA-containing
dataset, 9,449 particles were clearly labeled by SA of a total of 53,527 side
views (17.7%).
Sample Preparation and Cryo-EM. S. cerevisiae CMG and Pol e were purified as
previously described (46, 47). To prepare EM grids, we first diluted each
sample with 20 mM Tris-acetate, pH 7.5, 40 mM K-glutamate, 2 mM DTT, and
0.1 mM EDTA. Sample homogeneity was first verified by negative-stain EM.
Negative stain of Pol e was performed as described above for CMG with
nanopointers. For cryo-grid preparation, we applied 3 μL of CMG–DNA
complex at a final concentration of 0.6 mg/mL to glow-discharged C-flat 1.2/
1.3 holey carbon grids, which were then incubated for 10 s at 10 °C and 95%
humidity, blotted for 3 s, and plunged into liquid ethane using an FEI
Vitrobot IV. We loaded the grids into a 300-keV FEI Titan Krios electron
microscope and collected images automatically in low-dose mode at a
magnification of 22,500× and a pixel size of 1.3 Å per pixel. A Gatan K2
Summit direct electron detector was used for image recording with an
underfocus range from −1.2 to −3.4 μm under superresolution mode (0.5×
binning). The dose rate was 10 e− per pixel-frame per second, and the total
exposure time was 8 s. The total dose was divided into a 40-frame movie,
and each frame was exposed for 0.2 s.
Image Processing and 3D Reconstruction. We collected about 2,000 raw movie
micrographs for CMG–DNA and 3,000 raw movie micrographs for CMG–bio–
DNA–SA. The movie frames were first aligned and superimposed by the
motioncorr program (48). Contrast transfer function parameters of each
aligned micrograph were calculated with CTFFIND4 (49). We manually
picked about 5,000 particles from different views to generate several good
2D averages that were used as templates for the subsequent automatic
particle picking. Automatic particle picking was then performed for the
whole dataset. Approximately 660,000 and half a million particles were
initially picked for CMG–ssDNA and CMG–forked DNA, respectively. We then
sorted them according to similarity to the 2D references. The bottom 10% of
particles that had very low z-scores were deleted from the particle pools. The
2D classification of all of the remaining particles was performed and particles in bad classes were removed. Next, 395,443 good particles of the CMG–
DNA sample and 243,796 good particles of the CMG–bio–DNA–SA sample
were kept for the following 3D classification. For CMG–ssDNA, we derived
six 3D models from the dataset: one model was identified having 14-mer
ssDNA and their associated particles were combined for further refinement;
one model was identified having 9-mer ssDNA and their associated particles
were combined for further refinement; two models showed no DNA inside
and closely resembled the closed and extended forms of apo CMG reported
previously (20); two remaining models were distorted and those particles
were discarded. A total of 83,043 and 83,002 particles were used for the final
refinement of the CMG–9-mer and CMG–14-mer ssDNA, leading to the 6.2-Å
map and 4.9-Å map, respectively (SI Appendix, Table S1). For the CMG–
forked DNA dataset, five 3D models were derived: one model showed clear
DNA and SA densities and their associated particles were combined for
further refinement (58,511 particles); the other models either did not have
DNA density or were distorted, and those particles were discarded, resulting
in only one 3D map at 6.1 Å (SI Appendix, Table S1). All particle numbers for
each of the three reported cryo-EM maps are detailed in SI Appendix, Figs.
S3 and S9. Finally, all of the resolution estimations were based on goldstandard Fourier shell correlation calculations to avoid overfitting and
reported resolutions were based on the Fourier shell correlation = 0.143
criterion. All of the density maps were corrected for modulation transfer
function of the detector and by applying a negative B-factor sharping. All
of the steps mentioned above, including particle autopicking, 2D classification, 3D classification, 3D refinement, and postprocess, were done in
RELION 1.4 (44) and RELION 2.0 (50). Local resolution was estimated using
ResMap (51). The negative-stain EM dataset of the full-length Pol e contained
28,785 raw particles. These particles were sorted into 64 classes in EMAN2 (43).
Six 2D class averages in views that showed a square-like feature were selected
for comparison with the side views of the CMG–Pol e.
Structural Modeling, Refinement, and Validation. Models of all S. cerevisiae
CMG subunits were directly extracted from the cryo-EM structure of the
yeast CMG (20). Specifically, each Mcm protein was split into two parts, NTD
and CTD, for subsequent docking. These models were rigid body-fitted into
the 3D density map with COOT (52) and Chimera (53). The single-stranded or
forked DNA was then manually built into the long density that ran through

from behind, and therefore head-to-head CMGs push inward toward one another (Fig. 8B). Therefore, the two CMGs must pass
one another to migrate out of the origin. For the two CMGs to pass
they must first transition from dsDNA to encircle opposite strands
of the parental DNA (Fig. 8B). Interestingly, a similar orientation of
the two E. coli DnaB helicases has been noted that requires them to
pass one another during initiation at the E. coli origin (41). Importantly, neither CMG can pass the other if one of the two CMGs
encircles dsDNA. Thus, the head-to-head geometry, and N-tier to
C-tier orientation during translocation, combine to provide a quality
control mechanism that requires both CMGs to encircle ssDNA
before either leaves the origin. Head-to-head hexameric helicases
that encircle dsDNA have also been demonstrated to facilitate DNA
melting (42), and thus the head-on orientation of two CMGs may
provide energy for the initial unwinding of dsDNA at origins.
