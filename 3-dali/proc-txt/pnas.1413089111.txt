The eukaryotic small ribosomal subunit carries only four ribosomal
(r) RNA methylated bases, all close to important functional sites.
N7-methylguanosine (m7G) introduced at position 1575 on 18S rRNA
by Bud23–Trm112 is at a ridge forming a steric block between
P- and E-site tRNAs. Here we report atomic resolution structures of
Bud23–Trm112 in the apo and S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM)bound forms. Bud23 and Trm112 interact through formation of a
β-zipper involving main-chain atoms, burying an important hydrophobic surface and stabilizing the complex. The structures revealed
that the coactivator Trm112 undergoes an induced fit to accommodate its methyltransferase (MTase) partner. We report important structural similarity between the active sites of Bud23 and
Coffea canephora xanthosine MTase, leading us to propose and
validate experimentally a model for G1575 coordination. We identify Bud23 residues important for Bud23–Trm112 complex formation and recruitment to pre-ribosomes. We report that though
Bud23–Trm112 binds precursor ribosomes at an early nucleolar
stage, m7G methylation occurs at a late step of small subunit biogenesis, implying specifically delayed catalytic activation. Finally, we
show that Bud23–Trm112 interacts directly with the box C/D snoRNA
U3-associated DEAH RNA helicase Dhr1 supposedly involved in central pseudoknot formation; this suggests that Bud23–Trm112 might
also contribute to controlling formation of this irreversible and dramatic structural reorganization essential to overall folding of small
subunit rRNA. Our study contributes important new elements to our
understanding of key molecular aspects of human ribosomopathy
syndromes associated with WBSCR22 (human Bud23) malfunction.

base stacking through increased hydrophobicity or altering steric
hindrance (10). rRNA base MTases use S-adenosyl-L-methionine
(SAM) as a methyl donor, and most have been shown or predicted
to belong to class I, containing the characteristic Rossmann-like
fold domain (11).
In budding yeast, six base methylations have been inventoried
on the large subunit, on the 25S rRNA. The six enzymes involved, Bmt2, Bmt5, Bmt6, Nop2, Rcm1, and Rrp8, have only
been identified recently (12–15); of these, only Nop2 (responsible for m5C2870) is essential to growth, whereas loss of any of
the others, including Bmt2 (m1A2142), Bmt5 (m3U2634), Bmt6
(m3U2843), Rcm1 (m5C2278), and Rrp8 (m1A645), does not impair cell
growth significantly (12–15). The small subunit 18S rRNA contains
one hypermodified base: m1-aminocarboxypropyl(acp)3-Ψ1191,
which is methylated at the N1 position by Nep1 (Emg1) (16), two
contiguous dimethylated adenosines m62 A1781 m62 A1782 , modified
at N6 by Dim1 (7), and one methylated guanosine m7G1575,
methylated at N7 by the Bud23–Trm112 complex (8, 17, 18). In
contrast to the majority of large subunit MTases, deletion of genes

Significance
Ribosomes are essential cellular nanomachines responsible for
all protein synthesis in vivo. Efficient and faithful ribosome
biogenesis requires a plethora of assembly factors whose
precise role and timing of action remains to be established.
Here we determined the crystal structure of Bud23–Trm112,
which is required for efficient pre-rRNA processing steps
leading to 18S rRNA synthesis and methylation of 18S rRNA at
position G1575. For the first time, to our knowledge, we
identified where on Bud23–Trm112 the contacts with precursor
ribosomes occur. We further report that the essential helicase
Dhr1 interacts directly with Bud23–Trm112, proposing a concerted action of these proteins in ribosome assembly. Finally,
we reveal that the methyltransferase activity of Bud23–Trm112
and its requirement for pre-rRNA processing are disconnected
in time.

n living cells, all proteins are synthesized by ribosomes, consisting in eukaryotes of four rRNAs and 80 ribosomal proteins.
Synthesizing these nanomachines is a complex multistep process
involving at least 200 assembly factors and dozens of small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) (1, 2). Ribosome assembly factors are
recruited to incipient ribosomes in a controlled stepwise and
dynamic process (3), and they are required for the synthesis, maturation, transport, and assembly of ribosomal components. Maturation of components includes pre-rRNA processing (generation of
the 5′ and 3′ termini of mature rRNA from long precursor molecules) and RNA modification (selection of specific rRNA residues
during subunit biogenesis for covalent modification). rRNA processing and modification are highly coordinated processes (4).
Methylation is a prevalent posttranscriptional rRNA modification, occurring either on riboses or bases (5). Ribose methylation
is essentially performed by box C/D snoRNA-guided enzymes (6),
whereas base methylations are specifically catalyzed by standalone
protein-only methyltransferases, which are highly conserved from
yeast to metazoans (7–9). Base methylation is thought to contribute to expanding the structural repertoire of RNA, promoting

Detailed experimental procedures are available in SI Materials and Methods.
Cloning, Production, and Purification of the Dhr1 [58-270] Domain. Plasmid
pVH481 (Table S1) encoding the full-length Saccharomyces cerevisiae DHR1
gene was used as template to amplify the DNA region encoding the Dhr1
[58–270] domain with primers oMG205 and oMG206 (Table S2). The PCR
amplicon was digested with BglII and XhoI (Fermentas) and cloned into
pGEX-6P-1 (BamHI–XhoI) to yield plasmid pMG679. The various plasmids,
oligonucleotides and strains used in this study are presented in Tables S1–S5.
The GST-Dhr1 [58–270] protein was expressed at 37 °C for 3 h, following
induction with 0.5 mM IPTG, in a transformed Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)
Gold strain cultured in 1 L of 2xYT medium. Cells were harvested and
resuspended in 20 mM Tris·HCl (pH 7.5), 200 mM NaCl. The protein was
purified on a Glutathione Sepharose 4B resin (GE Healthcare) and eluted
with the same buffer supplemented with 20 mM reduced glutathione. GST
was cleaved from the Dhr1 [58–270] domain by overnight incubation with

Reconstitution of Dhr1–Bud23–Trm112 Ternary Complex. The complex was
reconstituted by mixing Bud23–Trm112 with a 1.5 M excess of Dhr1 [58–270] in

The ternary complex was injected on Superdex 200 10/300 GL (GE Healthcare)

Results and Discussion
An Induced Fit in Trm112 Is Necessary to Accommodate the
Methyltransferase Bud23. The crystal structure of the complex

between Trm112 and the Bud23 MTase domain (residues 1–202)
from S. cerevisiae (referred to hereafter as Bud23–Trm112) was
determined in the absence and presence of SAM cofactor at 2 Å
and 2.2 Å resolution, respectively (Table S6). The structures of
the apo and SAM-bound forms of the complex are very similar
(rmsd value of 0.2 Å). The Bud23 MTase domain adopts a typical class I SAM-dependent MTase fold composed of a central
seven-stranded β-sheet flanked by four α-helices on one side
(αY, αZ, αA, and αB) and two on the other (αD and αE; Fig. 1A
and Fig. S1A). SAM binds Bud23 in a canonical manner compared with class I SAM-dependent MTases, i.e., at the
C-terminal extremity of the central seven-stranded β-sheet (SI
Results and Discussion). Upon SAM binding, residues I12–H20
and A126–N131 of Bud23 become ordered (Fig. 1B). Residues
K21–G24, which adopt an extended conformation in the absence
of SAM, rearrange so as to expand helix αY by four residues.
As a result, the N-terminal residues (residues 12–15) fold as an
extended loop followed by helix αY (residues 16–24), which lies
on the SAM cofactor. Finally, the W122 side chain, adopting two
alternate conformations in the apo structure, is locked in a single
conformation upon SAM binding (Fig. 1B).
Trm112 is composed of a zinc-binding domain formed by the
N- and C-terminal extremities of the protein and consisting of an
α-helix (α1) packed against a four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet,
as well as a central helical domain (helices α2–α4; Fig. 1A and
Fig. S1B). The structures of Trm112 alone and in the complex
are very similar (rmsd value of 0.9 Å) (20). However, a slight
rigid body rotation of the Trm112 central domain relative to the
zinc-binding domain is observed to accommodate Bud23 in
the Trm112–Bud23 complex, compared with the structure of the
Trm112 protein alone. Another important difference is observed
for Trm112 residues 128–136, which drastically rearrange in the
complex upon rotation of the peptide bond connecting N127 to
L128 so as to avoid steric clashes with Bud23. A similar rearrangement was previously described for the corresponding region
from Encephalitozoon cuniculi Trm112 in the complex with
Mtq2 (EcMtq2-Trm112) (31). Hence, we conclude that Trm112
undergoes an induced fit to accommodate Bud23. Because similar rearrangements were described in other Trm112-MTase
complexes in other species, we suggest this induced fit is conserved to adapt Trm112 to its multiple MTase partners.
Formation of the Bud23–Trm112 Complex Is Required for Efficient 18S
rRNA Maturation. In the Bud23–Trm112 complex, both proteins

interact mainly via formation of a parallel β-zipper between
Bud23 strand β3 and Trm112 strand β4 to form a remarkable
continuous 11-stranded β-sheet (Fig. 1 A and C). Complex formation involves a large surface area of 1,230 Å2 formed by 19 and
24 residues of Bud23 and Trm112, respectively. The interface is
characterized by the presence of a central large hydrophobic core
composed of residues F50, V72, L87, L95, M96, L97, P105, and

subunit is lethal (Nep1, Dim1) or affects cell growth drastically
(Bud23–Trm112) (7–9, 19). Surprisingly, however, the analysis of
catalytically dead methyltransferase mutants has revealed it is the
protein itself, rather than its enzymatic activity in RNA methylation, that is essential to subunit biogenesis, and in particular for
pre-rRNA processing (7–9, 19). Nonetheless, these base methylations all cluster at functionally important and highly conserved
sites on the ribosome, suggesting possible roles in translation.
Recently we demonstrated that Bud23 is active in 18S rRNA
N7G methylation as a heterodimer in a complex with Trm112
(17). Trm112 is a small zinc finger protein that interacts with and
activates three class I MTases in addition to Bud23; these are all
related to translation and include Mtq2, which methylates the
translation termination factor eRF1, and Trm9 and Trm11,
which both modify tRNAs (20–22). Trm112 is required for Bud23
metabolic stability and hence for Bud23-mediated methylation of
18S rRNA and efficient small subunit synthesis (17). Bud23–
Trm112 binds early nucleolar pre-ribosomes and could act at the
time of A2 cleavage (17). Genetic interactions suggest that Bud23
might be involved in disassembly of the small subunit processome
(18), a large ribonucleoprotein complex corresponding to nascent
pre-40S ribosomes that have undergone initial U3 snoRNAdependent pre-rRNA cleavages (23). More recently, Bud23 was
reported to interact physically and functionally with the DEAH
box helicase Dhr1 (24), also required for processing at cleavage
site A2 and with a predicted role in central pseudoknot formation (25).
Human Bud23, known as WBSCR22 (or MERM1), is also
required for 40S subunit biogenesis and 18S rRNA G1575
methylation (26, 27). WBSCR22 has been identified as a cancer
metastasis promoter, a breast cancer biomarker, and a putative
therapeutic target in myeloma (28, 29). WBSCR22 is also one of
the multiple genes associated with the neurodevelopmental disorder William–Beuren syndrome (30).
More than 200 ribosome assembly factors have been identified
in budding yeast, though their precise role in subunit biogenesis
remains largely to be elucidated. Here we have combined structural and functional approaches to characterize the 18S rRNA
MTase Bud23–Trm112. We report essential features of methylation catalysis, including most importantly an experimentally
validated model for guanosine substrate coordination in the catalytic pocket of Bud23, and the requirement for an induced fit in
the coactivator Trm112 to achieve complex formation and stabilization. We further report that Bud23–Trm112 interacts directly with the U3 snoRNA-associated helicase Dhr1, forming in
vitro a trimeric complex. This observation offers novel important
insights into the involvement of Bud23–Trm112 in small subunit
biogenesis. Finally, we provide a methylation timetable, demonstrating that m7G occurs at a late stage of subunit assembly, and
Bud23–Trm112 is recruited to pre-ribosomes at an early nucleolar step; this implies specifically delayed catalytic activation.

and L129 of Trm112 (Fig. 1 C and D and Fig. S1 A and B). The
hydrophobic core at the interface is shielded from the solvent
upon complex formation, which explains the stabilizing effect of
Trm112 on Bud23 in S. cerevisiae cells and why it is required to
obtain soluble Bud23 in E. coli (17). The hydrophobic interface is
surrounded by polar residues involved in the formation of 12
hydrogen bonds and two salt bridges (Table S7). Two hydrogen
bonds are formed between the main-chain atoms of residues located in Bud23 strand β3 (L97) and Trm112 strand β4 (P126 and
L128) and hence contribute to the formation of the β-zipper interaction (Fig. 1C). Among the other polar contacts, two Bud23
residues (D94 and R107) are engaged in five hydrogen bonds with

K2, T5, N7, and R53 residues of Trm112 ((Fig. 1 C and D). Finally, two salt bridges are involved in the interaction (D112 and
R139 of Bud23 with R53 and D17 of Trm112, respectively; Fig.
1D and Table S7).
To validate the functional importance of Bud23–Trm112 complex formation in ribosome biogenesis, we mutated three Bud23
residues involved in the interface with Trm112: D94, M96, and
D112 (Fig. 1 C and D). Altogether, five substitutions were introduced at these positions (Table 1). Because Bud23 cannot be
expressed as a soluble protein alone (17), we could not use classical
in vitro approaches to test the ability of these mutants to interact
with Trm112. We reasoned that because deletion of TRM112
strongly affects Bud23 stability in vivo (17), Bud23 mutants unable

to interact with Trm112 should demonstrate decreased stability in
yeast cells. The M96A mutant exhibited a modest decrease at
protein level and was not associated with any particular phenotype,
suggesting that this Bud23 mutant still interacts with Trm112
(Table 1 and Fig. S2B). The remaining mutants (D94A, D112A,
and the charge inversion mutants D94R and D112R) resulted in
strongly impaired Bud23 stability, correlating with a slow-growth
defect, similarly to the bud23Δ strain (Table 1 and Fig. S2 A and B)
(8). Next, we analyzed the G1575 methylation level in these four
mutants. Quite surprisingly, considering the high instability of these
Bud23 mutants, only one substitution (D112R) affected methylation (Table 1 and Fig. S2C), which indicates that low residual levels
of the D94A, D94R, and D112A Bud23 mutants are sufficient to
efficiently modify 18S rRNA and suggests that these three mutants
are still able to interact with Trm112, most likely in a transient
manner. This finding also implies effective recycling of the MTase
complex toward nascent pre-ribosomes. Regarding the D112R
mutant, we postulate that as D112 forms a salt bridge with R53 of
Trm112 (Fig. 1D), its replacement by the positively charged arginine induces repulsion between the two proteins and completely
precludes complex formation, thereby totally inhibiting 18S rRNA
methylation.
Finally, we analyzed the effect of these four mutants on ribosome biogenesis (Table 1 and Fig. S3). As expected from their low
protein abundance, three mutants (D94R, D112A, and D112R)
exhibited reduced 18S rRNA production. More surprisingly, the
unstable D94A mutant did not demonstrate any obvious 18S rRNA
production defects, suggesting that it is less affected than the three
others. It is noteworthy that substitutions at position D94 affect
protein function less than equivalent substitutions at position
D112, and that charge inversion mutants display the strongest 18S
rRNA maturation defects, suggesting that Ala mutants retain more
Trm112 binding activity than Arg mutants; this agrees with a recent
report showing that the Bud23 D94G mutant retains the ability to
bind to Trm112, whereas D112G does not (24).
G1575 Is Coordinated by a Network of Conserved Bud23 Residues.

Mapping sequence conservation at the surface of Bud23–
Trm112 revealed a highly conserved, positively charged area
surrounding the cavity where the methyl group donor lies (Fig.
S4 A–C). To understand how Bud23 selects and N7G methylates
18S rRNA at position 1575, we used DALI (32) to search the
Protein Data Bank (PDB) for proteins sharing strong structural
similarity with Bud23 MTase domain; this identified more than
900 crystal structures of MTases with Z-scores ranging from 20 to
Létoquart et al.

10. Among these structures, a few catalyze N7 methylation on a
purine ring, including E. coli ArmA and RmtB (33), E. cuniculi
mRNA cap guanine N 7 -MTase (34), and Coffea canephora
xanthosine MTase (XMT; rmsd value with Bud23 of 3 Å over 171
Cα atoms, 16% sequence identity (35); SI Results and Discussion).
Superimposing the XMT–xanthosine complex onto Bud23 made
it possible, to our knowledge for the first time, to propose a robust
model for 18S rRNA G1575 coordination in the active site of
Bud23 (Fig. 2 A and B), and this provided important insights into
the mode of catalysis and the timing of methylation during ribosome biogenesis. First, many of the XMT residues involved in
xanthosine binding are strikingly conserved or replaced by residues
with similar properties in Bud23 (Fig. 2A): Y22, Q32, Q121, and
W122 of Bud23 match, respectively, with Y18, N25, Q161, and
W162 of XMT. Second, no steric clashes are observed between the
xanthosine purine ring and Bud23 residues. Third, superimposition
of the purine ring of GMP onto the xanthosine purine ring reveals
that the carbonyl group of the GMP ring could form a direct hydrogen bond with the Q121 side chain and a water-mediated hydrogen bond with the W122 side chain, whereas its purine ring
would stack onto Y159 of Bud23 (Fig. 2B). In this model, the
N7 atom of GMP is only 2.6 Å away from the SAM methyl group
and ideally positioned for methyl transfer by the inline SN2-type
reaction catalyzed by most class I SAM-dependent MTases (11).
Finally, to orient the 5′ and 3′ groups of the GMP ribose toward
the solvent in a position compatible with accommodating the
rRNA around G1575, the ribose moiety has to undergo a rotation
relative to the purine ring, bringing its 2′-OH within hydrogen
bonding distance to the hydroxyl group of Y159 and to a water
molecule present in our crystal structure. This water molecule
could mediate the hydrogen bonds connecting the ribose 2′-OH to
S118, and Q32 side chains (Fig. 2B). In this model, the conserved
K21 and R27 of helices αY and αZ are perfectly oriented to interact with the 18S rRNA phosphate backbone, suggesting a
possible role for these residues in recruiting Bud23–Trm112 to
pre-ribosomes (see below). Furthermore, all residues of Bud23
surrounding GMP in our model are strictly or highly conserved
in Bud23 proteins of different species (Fig. S1A).
To validate our model, we mutated several strongly conserved
Bud23 residues (E18, K21/R27, Y22, I31, S118, W122, and Y159)
lining the proposed GMP binding site and analyzed the effect of
these mutations on RNA methylation, growth, and rRNA production. Because we have previously shown that Bud23–Trm112 is
recruited to nucleolar 90S pre-ribosomes (the first intermediate
detected in the assembly pathway and containing the 35S primary

the dynamics of recruitment of the Bud23–Trm112 complex to
pre-ribosomes (Fig. 2 C and D and Fig. S4D). As a control, to inactivate Bud23 MTase function, we mutated the strictly conserved
D77 residue, which forms hydrogen bonds with the SAM ribose
2′ and 3′ hydroxyl groups (Fig. 1B), into Ala (D77A), as previously
done for other MTases (9, 31). Five mutants were stably expressed

while retaining SAM binding activity in vitro (Table 1 and Fig. S2 B
and C). Yeast cells expressing these five mutations had a normal
doubling time and normal rRNA production (Table 1 and Fig.
S2A). Like WT Bud23, the Y22A, W122A, and Y159A mutants
predominantly colocalized with pre-90S ribosomes (fractions 10–
12), with limited amounts in the lighter fractions (fractions 1–6;
Fig. 2 C and D and Fig. S4D). Importantly, Trm112 comigrated
partially with pre–90S-bound Bud23, indicating that the MTase is
integrated within pre-ribosomes as a heterodimeric Bud23–Trm112
complex. Trm112 was also abundantly detected in lighter fractions,
consistently with its known involvement in other complexes,

thesis was affected in D77A, confirming that Bud23 MTase activity is fully dispensable for 18S rRNA production, whereas the
presence of the protein is required (8); this is similar to what has
been reported for other small ribosomal subunit base MTases
(Dim1 and Emg1/Nep1) (7–9). Because I31 and S118 were found
to have lost their ability to interact directly with SAM, we
propose that these substitutions induce protein misfolding. In
agreement with this view, I31W and S118E showed impaired
growth and diminished protein stability. S118R proved quite
stable, did not affect growth, and showed an increased level of
association with large pre-90S ribosomes compared with wildtype protein (Fig. 2 C and D and Fig. S2 A and B). Again, the
distribution of Trm112 strikingly matched that of Bud23, and the

smaller in size, involved in tRNA (with Trm9 and Trm11) and
translation factor (with Mtq2) modifications (see the introduction).
In cells expressing the K21E/R27E mutation, most of the Bud23,
and concomitantly of Trm112, was detected in lighter fractions of
the gradient (peak centered around fraction 7), supporting a role
for these positively charged residues in the interaction with the 18S
rRNA phosphate backbone; this is consistent with the observed
methylation inhibition (Table 1) and, as predicted above, indicates
deficient pre-ribosome recruitment.

heavier fractions were clearly enriched in Trm112. We speculate
that the higher stability of S118R compared with S118E results
from increased affinity for pre-90S, the mutation contributing
a positively charged side chain contacting the rRNA phosphate
backbone; this leads to retention of Bud23/Trm112 on nucleolar
pre-ribosomes for an extended time. Because the S118R mutant
behaves like the SAM binding-deficient D77A mutant (Table 1
and Fig. 2 C and D), this further suggests that SAM binding to
Bud23–Trm112 influences its affinity for the pre-ribosome but
does not interfere with correct 18S rRNA maturation.
Bud23–Trm112 and the DEAH Box Helicase Dhr1 Form a Ternary Complex.

The DEAH box RNA helicase Dhr1 and Bud23–Trm112 are part
of the same pre-ribosomes (17). Further, a Dhr1 domain spanning
residues [195–252] interacts with Bud23 in a two-hybrid assay (24).
We expressed and purified a recombinant Dhr1 fragment consisting
of residues 58–270 and analyzed its ability to interact directly with
Bud23–Trm112 in vitro. Size-exclusion chromatography experiments demonstrated that Dhr1 [58–270] interacts stably with
Bud23–Trm112, forming a heterotrimeric complex (Fig. 3A). Because our Bud23 construct extends from residue 1–202, this further
indicates that residues 203–275 are dispensable for interaction with
Trm112 and Dhr1. The helicase Dhr1 interacts tightly with the box
C/D snoRNA U3 (25), which associates through Watson–Crick

base-pairing with pre-rRNAs regulating the timing of central
pseudoknot formation. The central pseudoknot is a long-range
interaction occurring between residues located >1.1 kb apart on
18S rRNA; its formation is essential to the overall folding of
small subunit rRNA. In maturing subunits, sequences basepaired in the pseudoknot are sequestered by interactions with U3.
Dhr1 is suggested to trigger U3 displacement, a prerequisite to
central pseudoknot formation (25).
Given the physical proximity of Dhr1 and Bud23–Trm112, we
wondered if Dhr1 might be involved in structural rearrangements within pre-ribosomes that might contribute to efficient
recruitment of Bud23–Trm112. We therefore established the
distribution of Bud23–Trm112 on velocity gradients in the
presence and absence of the helicase (Fig. 3B). We used a strain
in which the endogenous promoter of DHR1 was replaced directly on the chromosome by a methionine-regulated expression
cassette (pMET). In this strain (pMET::dhr1), the expression of
DHR1 is rapidly “switched off” upon addition of methionine to
the growth medium; this leads to the previously described inhibition of pre-rRNA processing at sites A1 and A2 and to accumulation of aberrant 22S RNA (Fig. 3B) (25). In pMET::dhr1,
markedly reduced amounts of Bud23–Trm112 were found to
comigrate with large nucleolar pre-90S ribosomes (Fig. 3B). A
shift to lighter fractions was particularly obvious upon addition

was directly subjected to primer extension (7). Lanes 1–2 and 3–4 in D show two independent biological replicates. Structural stops (*) indicate that gel

wild-type cells (lanes 1 and 4), the presence of m62 A1781 m62 A1782 on 20S pre-rRNA precludes detection of m7G1575 from primer b because the reverse transcriptase cannot get across position 1781/1782. The m7G modification is detected only in catalytically deficient dim1 cells (dim1-Y131G, lanes 2 and 3).
Pre-rRNAs selected by primer b on total RNA include 20S, 32S, 33S, and 35S. Because 32S, 33S, and 35S are naturally nondimethylated and because no m7G
signal is detected in lanes 1 and 4, we conclude that m7G takes place at the level of 20S pre-rRNAs.

m7G1575 Is a Late Maturation Event Occurring on 3′-Extended 18S
rRNA Precursors. The superimposition of the Trm112-Bud23-

GMP model onto residue G1575 in the crystal structure of the
S. cerevisiae 80S ribosome (36) revealed important steric clashes
between Bud23 and ribosomal components (Fig. 4A), suggesting
that methylation occurs on precursors rather than on mature 18S
rRNA. To test this prediction, we established the timing of
methylation by differential primer extension, using oligonucleotides complementary to 18S rRNA (primer a), or internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1; primer b; Fig. 4B). All primer extensions
were performed on total RNA.
To map m7G by primer extension, total RNA was cleaved
specifically at the site of modification by reduction with sodium
borohydride followed by aniline treatment (17). With this method,
m7G1575 methylation was detected from primer a and, as expected,
was lost in bud23Δ and trm112Δ cells (Fig. 4C) (17). To establish
a modification timetable, we used as a reference m62 A1781 m62 A1782
introduced by Dim1 at the 3′ end of 18S rRNA and previously
established to occur at the level of 20S pre-rRNA (7). As expected, m62 Am62 A was detected with primer b (Fig. 4C). In contrast to
m7G, mapping m62 Am62 A by primer extension does not require
any treatment of the RNA before cDNA synthesis, because it is
a “bulky” modification, which blocks reverse transcriptase progression, producing a “stutter” (visible as a doublet) and eventually polymerase drop-off (7, 17, 19; further discussed in ref.
37). m62 Am62 A was detected in cells lacking Bud23 or Trm112
(Fig. 4C), incidentally demonstrating that Dim1 dimethylation is
not dependent upon prior m7G1575 modification by Bud23–
Trm112. Technically, the m7G modification cannot be detected
from primer b on 20S pre-rRNA because the Dim1-dependent
dimethylation at A1781 and A1782 blocks the reverse transcriptase before it reaches G1575 (Fig. 4D, lanes 1 and 4).
However, in cells expressing the catalytically deficient allele
dim1-Y131G as their sole source of Dim1, m7G1575 became
detectable by primer extension from oligonucleotide b (Fig. 4D,
lanes 2 and 3); this demonstrates that among the RNAs selected
by primer b, which include the 35S, 33S, 32S, and 20S pre-rRNAs,
some are m7G methylated. Incidentally, this observation also
demonstrates that m7G is not dependent on prior dimethylation
by Dim1. Because the 32S, 33S, and 35S are naturally nondimethylated pre-rRNA species, and because they did not appear
to be m7G methylated in our assay (Fig. 4D, lanes 1 and 4), we
conclude that m7G1575 occurs at the level of 20S pre-rRNA. In
conclusion, Bud23–Trm112 and Dim1 are both active at the level
of 20S pre-rRNA and they operate independently of each other.
Conclusions
In this work, we present crystal structures of yeast Bud23–
Trm112 complexes in the apo and SAM-bound forms, revealing
essential aspects of methylation catalysis, coactivation by Trm112
and ribosomal substrate recognition. We show that Trm112
undergoes an induced fit to accommodate its MTase partners.
We confirm our earlier prediction that Bud23 associates with
Trm112 through formation of a parallel β-zipper involving hydrogen bonds between main-chain atoms and masking a large,
destabilizing hydrophobic surface on Bud23 (17). Together with
the structure of the Mtq2–Trm112 complex (31), the Bud23–
Trm112 structure highlights the extraordinary structural plasticity
allowing Trm112 to interact with four MTases harboring less than
Létoquart et al.

When Does m7G1575 Take Place? Bud23 binds pre-ribosomes at an
early nucleolar stage (17); nonetheless, we show that modification is specifically delayed, occurring at a late step in ribosome
biogenesis, corresponding to 20S pre-rRNA formation and implying specific catalytic activation. What triggers this specific
MTase activation is not currently understood. We discuss above
the substrate accessibility issues within the Bud23–Trm112 catalytic cavity. Presumably, subunit biogenesis has to achieve
a specific maturation stage such that substrate folding becomes
compatible with RNA modification. We report that Bud23–
Trm112 interacts directly with the DEAH box helicase Dhr1,
forming a trimeric complex in vitro and requiring the latter’s
intervention for efficient recruitment to pre-ribosomes. Dhr1 is
suggested to regulate the timing of central pseudoknot formation
(25), a dramatic, irreversible structural reorganization absolutely
essential to overall folding of small subunit RNA. Whether
Bud23–Trm12 contributes to efficient central pseudoknot formation is under investigation.
Bud23–Trm112 displays striking structural similarity to E. coli
RlmAI, which catalyzes N1-guanine base methylation on 23S
rRNA (Fig. S5). RlmAI is composed of an N-terminal zincbinding domain juxtaposed to a class I MTase domain. In Bud23–
Trm112, interestingly, the zinc-binding domain of Trm112 occupies precisely in trans the position of a similar domain present in
cis in RlmAI, with the zinc atom similarly located in the two
structures (Fig. S5). Because the zinc-binding domain of RlmAI is
proposed to interact with 23S rRNA (38), we suggest that Trm112
might contribute to rRNA binding. The observation that Trm112
systematically comigrates with pre-ribosome-associated Bud23 is
compatible with this possibility (Figs. 2 C and D and 3B) (17).
The function of the 18S rRNA m7G1575 methylation in ribosome
biogenesis and translation is not yet fully understood. Deletion
of BUD23 confers hypersensitivity to paromomycin and a coldsensitive growth defect (Fig. S6). However, methylation per se is not
required for optimal growth because cells expressing catalytically
defective bud23 alleles exhibit normal growth (Table 1) (8). We
believe it very unlikely that cells would have evolved and conserved
such a sophisticated modification mechanism, involving formation
of the Bud23–Trm112 heterodimeric holoenzyme and delayed
modification, if m7G1575 did not confer any advantages for ribosome
biogenesis or function. On the small subunit, m7G is precisely located at a ridge forming a steric block between the P- and E-site
tRNAs, compatible with a possible function during protein synthesis. For comparison, Dim1 is essential to cell survival because it is
required for early nucleolar pre-rRNA processing steps indispensable for 18S rRNA synthesis, whereas the m62 A1781 m62 A1782
dimethylation is not essential to growth, and cells expressing a
catalytically deficient methylation allele of DIM1 are perfectly viable
(7, 19). However, yeast cells expressing nondimethylated ribosomes
are hypersensitive to aminoglycoside antibiotics and impaired for
in vitro translation of specific mRNAs (19); this indicates that the
modification does play a significant role in translation.
Finally, WBSCR22, the human Bud23 ortholog, is highly
expressed in invasive breast cancers, and the integrity of its SAM
binding motif is required to confer metastatic properties to otherwise nonmetastatic cells (28). Furthermore, silencing of WBSCR22

20% overall sequence identity. Bud23, Mtq2, Trm9, and most
likely Trm11 use the same region of their class I SAM-dependent
MTase fold, and strikingly similar types of interactions, to bind to
the same region of their activator Trm112.
In addition, we identify residues important for Bud23–Trm112
complex formation, SAM binding, methyl transfer, and association with pre-ribosomes. We have modeled the catalytic pocket
of Bud23, concluding that it coordinates its substrate in a fashion
similar to C. canephora xanthosine MTase, with the guanosine
aligned for methyl transfer according to an inline SN2-type catalysis, typical of class I MTases.

conditions, indicating that even in the absence of methionine, the
expression of DHR1 is affected owing to promoter replacement.
The altered distribution of Bud23–Trm112 observed in pMET::
dhr1 is similar to that observed with mutation K21E/R27E, located
in the proposed surface of interaction with pre-ribosomes, leading
us to conclude that Dhr1 contributes to efficient recruitment of
Bud23–Trm112 to pre-ribosomes.

absolutely essential observations on Bud23–Trm112 catalysis and
substrate interaction, this work contributes decisive novel elements
to the molecular characterization of human disease symptoms associated with ribosome biogenesis dysfunction caused by WBSCR22
malfunction.
