Type IV secretion (T4S) systems mediate the transfer of proteins
and DNA across the cell envelope of bacteria. These systems play
important roles in bacterial pathogenesis and in horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance. The VirB4 ATPase of the T4S system is
essential for both the assembly of the system and substrate
transfer. In this article, we present the crystal structure of the Cterminal domain of Thermoanaerobacter pseudethanolicus VirB4.
This structure is strikingly similar to that of another T4S ATPase,
VirD4, a protein that shares only 12% sequence identity with
VirB4. The VirB4 domain puriﬁes as a monomer, but the full-length
protein is observed in a monomer-dimer equilibrium, even in the
presence of nucleotides and DNAs. We also report the negative
stain electron microscopy structure of the core complex of the T4S
system of the Escherichia coli pKM101 plasmid, with VirB4 bound.
In this structure, VirB4 is also monomeric and bound through its
N-terminal domain to the core’s VirB9 protein. Remarkably, VirB4
is observed bound to the side of the complex where it is ideally
placed to play its known regulatory role in substrate transfer.

T

ype IV secretion (T4S) systems are large, multicomponent
secretion machines that are found in both Gram-positive and
Gram-negative bacteria as well as in some archaea. The T4S
system is responsible for horizontal transfer of plasmid DNA
between bacteria during conjugation, thereby contributing to the
spread of antibiotic resistance genes in healthcare settings (1, 2).
T4S systems are also found in pathogens, where they mediate the
translocation of effector proteins from pathogen to host cell: for
example, in Helicobacter pylori, the causing agent of peptic ulcer
disease and related cancers (3). Other important human pathogens that rely on T4S systems are Bordetella pertussis, Legionella
pneumophila, Brucella spp., and Bartonella spp. Recently a T4S
system in Streptococcus suis was shown to be important for virulence (4).
In Gram-negative bacteria the T4S system span both the inner
and outer membranes and are composed of at least 12 components, termed VirB1–VirB11 and VirD4 proteins, after the nomenclature of the Agrobacterium tumefaciens VirB/D T4S system
(5). Fourteen copies of three proteins, VirB7, VirB9, VirB10,
form the so-called “core” complex, a stable 1.05 MDa complex
spanning the two membranes (6). The core complex is composed
of two layers, termed I and O layers, linked by thin threads of
electron density, each layer inserting in the inner and outer
membranes, respectively (Fig. S1A). A more detailed view of the
O layer was revealed by the crystal structure of this region,
uncovering that the VirB10 component traverses not only the
inner but also the outer membrane, forming an α-helical outer
membrane pore (7). A pilus is often present and composed of
a major and a minor component, VirB2 (8) and VirB5 (9), respectively. VirB5 is thought to act as an adhesin (9). VirB1 and
VirB8 are thought to function in assembly and VirB3 and VirB6
are inner-membrane proteins with yet unknown roles (10). Three
cytoplasmic ATPases, VirB4, VirB11, and VirD4, energize the
system and each of them is essential for substrate transfer.

VirD4, also termed “coupling protein,” recruits T4S system
substrates to the VirB1–11 secretion channel. Crystal structures
of hexameric forms of homologs of both VirD4 and VirB11 have
been solved (11–13).
The VirB4 ATPase is the most conserved T4S system component: it is vital for pilus biogenesis (14), substrate transfer, and
virulence (15–17). VirB4 proteins are between 600 and 900
residues, often forming two distinct domains (Fig. S1B). The Cterminal domain (CTD) is about 400 residues and contains the
ATPase activity. This domain is the most evolutionary conserved
part of VirB4 proteins and contains the catalytically essential
Walker A and Walker B motifs, characteristic of proteins with
RecA-like catalytic domains. A homology model of the VirB4
CTD from A. tumefaciens was proposed (18), based on a structure of the CTD of TrwB, the VirD4 protein of the Escherichia
coli R388 plasmid. The less conserved N-terminal domain
(NTD) is generally believed to form the interaction with the
membrane with one to three predicted transmembrane regions,
depending on species. The oligomerization state of VirB4 proteins and their localization within the cell are unclear: monomeric, dimeric, trimeric, and hexameric forms have been reported
and VirB4 proteins have been puriﬁed successfully from cytoplasmic and membrane fractions (19–25).
Here we present two structures: (i) the crystal structure of the
VirB4 CTD from the Gram-positive bacterium Thermoanaerobacter pseudethanolicus (TpsVirB4CTD) and (ii) the negative stain
electron microscopy (EM) structure of the VirB4 protein from the
T4S system encoded by the E. coli pKM101 plasmid (TraB, referred to hereafter as pkVirB4) bound to the corresponding
VirB7/VirB9/VirB10 (referred to thereafter as pkVirB7/pkVirB9/
pkVirB10) core complex. TpsVirB4CTD puriﬁes as a monomer.
The structure of TpsVirB4CTD demonstrates that VirB4CTD is
structurally similar to VirD4CTD. From the structural comparison between TpsVirB4CTD and VirD4CTD, we identify in
TpsVirB4 and pkVirB4 a conserved arginine ﬁnger at the surface
of the protein far from its ATP-binding site, suggesting that both
proteins oligomerize to form a functional ATP-binding site. Mass
spectrometry experiments on both full-length TpsVirB4 and

Results and Discussion
Structure of TpsVirB4CTD. Because we failed to crystallize a number
of mesophilic VirB4 homologs and fragments, we searched the
National Center for Biotechnology Information microbial genome database for VirB4 homologs of thermophilic origin. We
identiﬁed a VirB4 homolog of 594 residues from the Grampositive bacterium, T. pseudethanolicus (GeneBank accession no.
ABY93733). TpsVirB4 shows ∼30% sequence identity to known
Gram-positive VirB4 proteins, such as those found in the broad
host-range plasmid pIP501 (26) and Streptococcus aureus plasmid
pGO1 (27). The TpsVirB4 gene is located on the chromosome
with homologs of VirB11 and VirD4 as neighboring genes.
TpsVirB4 shows 20–25% sequence identity to pkVirB4 and other
known Gram-negative T4S VirB4 proteins, and is resembling Flike conjugative T4S system VirB4 proteins (28) such as TraC of
the E. coli plasmid K12 (29).
A construct of the near full-length TpsVirB4 (residues 10–594),
was expressed in E. coli and puriﬁed (Fig. S1C). The protein did
not crystallize and was therefore subjected to limited proteolysis
with trypsin to identify a fragment amenable to crystallographic
studies. A mixture of two fragments [residues 190–594 and residues 203–594; also conﬁrmed by mass spectrometry (see Fig. 2A)]
was obtained that yielded crystals diffracting to high resolution
(Fig. S1C). These fragments encompass the entire CTD of
TpsVirB4 (TpsVirB4CTD). The structure of TpsVirB4CTD was
solved using single anomalous diffraction phasing to 2.35 Å
(Table S1). Subsequently, a complex with bound ADP and Mg2+
was solved to 2.45 Å (Table S1). All crystals contain four molecules in the asymmetric unit.
The structure of TpsVirB4CTD can be subdivided into two
domains, one RecA-like α/β domain that contains the ATPbinding site and one four-helix bundle domain (Fig. 1A and Fig.

A

B

S2A). The RecA-like α-/β-domain contains a large parallel
β-sheet comprising β-strands β3−β9 sandwiched between helixes
α1, α2, and α7−α11, which extends in a sharp turn with four
additional antiparallel β-strands, β10, β11, β1, and β2. The fourhelix bundle domain is composed of helices α3–α6 (Fig. 1A). A
DALI search identiﬁed the C-terminal domain of TrwB, the
hexameric VirD4 homolog of the T4S system encoded by the
E. coli plasmid R388, as the closest structural homolog of
TpsVirB4CTD (RMSD in Cα atoms of 3.5 Å) (Fig. 1B and Fig.
S2B), despite a shared sequence identity of only 12% over the
structurally aligned residues (Fig. S3A).
Walker A ([A/G]XXXXGK[S/T]) and Walker B (hhDE; h
corresponds to any hydrophobic residue) motifs are clearly recognizable and include residues Ala244-Ser251 and residues
Val469-Glu472, respectively (Fig. 1C and Fig. S3 A and B).
Three additional conserved regions, motifs C, D and E, can be
identiﬁed, of which motifs C and E line the catalytic site, and
motif D is located facing the surface of the protein at the opposite side relative to the active site (Figs. 1A, and Figs. S2A and
S3A). Motif C (DX[D/E]X1–3E) is a less conserved motif for
VirB4 proteins and includes residues Asp272-Glu276, which line
the catalytic Mg2+ site. Motif D (RK) and E ([S/T]Q), containing
residues Arg496-Lys497 and Ser507-Gln508, respectively, were
previously identiﬁed as one motif (21), but because they are
clearly separated in space, they are more correctly divided into
two motifs (Fig. S3A).
Nucleotide Binding Site. A structure of TpsVirB4CTD in complex
with ADP and Mg2+ was solved to 2.45 Å, showing an ADP
molecule bound with full occupancy in two of the four protomers
of the asymmetric unit (Fig. 1C and Fig. S3B). The α- and
β-phosphates of ADP are recognized similarly as in other RecAlike ATPases with the conserved Walker A lysine, here Lys250,
forming an electrostatic interaction with the β-phosphate of
ADP (Fig. 1C and Fig. S3B). The α- and β-phosphates also make
tight interactions with backbone amides of the P-loop of the
Walker A motif, here residues Gly247, Ala248, Gly249, and
Lys250. The Mg2+ is coordinated between Ser251 of the Walker
A motif, Glu274 of motif C, the β-phosphate of ADP, and three
water molecules, which connect the Mg2+ with Asp471 and
Glu472 of the Walker B motif. The adenine moiety is stacked

pkVirB4 indeed reveal dimeric forms in addition to monomeric
forms. The EM structure of the core complex bound to pkVirB4
unexpectedly reveal an interaction between a monomeric pkVirB4
molecule and the outer wall of the core complex I layer, the
NTD of pkVirB4 and pkVirB9 forming a substantial part of
the interface. This side-on interaction provides a rational for the
essential regulatory function that VirB4 plays in T4S.

electrostatic interaction with the carbonyl group of the backbone
of Ile579.
Oligomerization State of VirB4 Proteins. TpsVirB4CTD puriﬁes as
a monomer. This ﬁnding was conﬁrmed by nanoelectrospray
ionization mass spectrometry (nanoESI-MS) analysis of the
protein (Fig. 2A). We next examined the oligomerization state of
full-length TpsVirB4 by nanoESI-MS and observed mostly
monomers and dimers (Fig. 2B). Small populations of trimers
and tetramers were also observed. Similar results were obtained
when the oligomerization state of the VirB4 homolog encoded
by the pKM101 plasmid, TraB (referred to here as pkVirB4), was
examined by nanoESI-MS (Fig. S4A). Monomer-dimer equilibria have been observed for a number of ATPases, for example
the SecA translocase or the Rep helicase (30, 31). Moreover,
ATP-binding has been shown to inﬂuence the oligomeric state of
ATPases. For example, FliI from the ﬂagellar system puriﬁes as
a monomer but hexamerizes readily in the presence of nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs (32; for review on hexameric ATPases, see ref. 33). Thus, we next examined the role of ATP-binding
on pkVirB4 protein oligomerization using nanoESI-MS. We
observed that addition of MgATPγS, MgAMPPNP, or MgADPAlF4 to the protein solution did not change the oligomeric state
of pkVirB4 (Fig. S4B). The same experiments were also carried
out with TpsVirB4 and similar results obtained. Addition of
single- and double-stranded DNA to the protein samples did not
result in protein-DNA complex formation, nor did it change the
oligomerization state of the proteins (Fig. S4C). Thus, both
pkVirB4 and TpsVirB4 are found in a monomer-dimer equilibrium under all investigated solution conditions.

residues (Arg and Lys) (Fig. S3A) in motif D of TpsVirB4
and pkVirB4 and compared the ATPase activity of the produced mutants with wild-type enzyme. We produced both single
and double mutants of both TpsVirB4 and pkVirB4, resulting
in the TpsVirB4R496A, TpsVirB4K497A, TpsVirB4R496AK497A,
pkVirB4R730A, pkVirB4K731A and pkVirB4R730AK731A proteins
(Fig. S1 C and D). The speciﬁc activities were measured for these
constructs as well as those of the wild-type TpsVirB4, TpsVirB4CTD,
and pkVirB4.
The ATPase activity was measured by monitoring the release
of inorganic phosphate (Pi) using an in vitro colorimetric ATPase
assay. The activity of both TpsVirB4 and pkVirB4 were affected
by the buffer composition as seen previously (20, 23). Both
proteins were completely inactive in the presence of 200 mM
NaCl but exhibited a relatively low speciﬁc activity in a buffer
depleted of chloride ions (20, 23).
The speciﬁc activity of TpsVirB4 was 96 nmol·min-1·mg−1 and
114 nmol·min-1·mg−1 at 37 and 60 °C, respectively. The
TpsVirB4CTD protein had a reduced activity. TpsVirB4R496A,
TpsVirB4K497A and TpsVirB4R496AK497A all showed a signiﬁcantly reduced activity compared with the wild-type enzyme,
being reduced to 4%, 10%, and 2% of the wild-type activity,
respectively (Fig. 2C). The speciﬁc activity of pkVirB4 at 37 °C
was 16 nmol·min-1·mg−1 (Fig. S3C). The constructs pkVirB4R730A, pkVirB4K731A, and pkVirB4R730AK731A exhibited an
activity of 6%, 5%, and 4% of wild-type pkVirB4 activity, respectively (Fig. S3C).
We therefore conclude that TpsVirB4 or pkVirB4 must
oligomerize to hydrolyze ATP. Because dimers are the predominant oligomeric species observed by ESI-MS, VirB4 dimers
might be the active form of the enzyme.

Characterization of an Arginine Finger in VirB4 Proteins. We noticed
that, in the structure-based alignment of the C-terminal domains
of TrwB, TpsVirB4, and pkVirB4 (Fig. S3A), motif D is conserved across the VirB4 and VirD4 protein families: this motif
contains a conserved Arg residue known in TrwB (Arg375) to act
as an arginine ﬁnger (34); that is, a residue essential for ATPase
activity but yet located in a region of the monomer far away from
the ATP-binding site. Arginine ﬁngers are typically contributed
to an ATP-binding site in trans by an adjacent subunit within
an oligomeric assembly. To provide biochemical evidence for
an arginine ﬁnger motif in VirB4 proteins, we mutated both

EM Structure of the VirB4/core Complex. We next determined the
structure of pkVirB4 (866 residues) bound to the corresponding
core complex (pkVirB7-pkVirB9-pkVirB10) by negative stain
EM (Fig. 3 and Figs. S1E and S5). This complex was puriﬁed
using a double pull-down (Fig. S1E), taking advantage of a Histag at the N terminus of pkVirB4 and a Strep-tag at the C terminus of pkVirB10.
Within the negative stain EM dataset (SI Methods), predominantly one momomer of VirB4 was found bound to the core
complex (Fig. S5 B–D). There were, however, examples of two or
three monomers of pkVirB4 bound to a single core complex; in

complex. In A, Right, and in C, the gray arrowhead indicates links between
the core and pkVirB4.

these cases, binding of these additional pkVirB4 molecules were
observed at deﬁned locations illustrated in Fig. S5D. Note that
these locations are too far apart (minimum ∼85 Å) to provide
a template for binding a higher order oligomeric VirB4 form.
Because core complex particles with only one pkVirB4 bound
constituted the vast majority of the data, we focused our effort to
solve that structure. The core-pkVirB4 complex structure was
solved to a resolution of 20 Å, and the pkVirB4 structure derived
from images of VirB4 bound to the core complex was reﬁned to
a resolution of 17 Å (Fig. 3 and Fig. S5; also see SI Methods).
The core complex has a diameter of 185 Å and a length of 230
Å from the top of the core complex to the lower tip of pkVirB4
(Fig. 3A). The structure can be divided into three main sections:
the O layer of the core complex facing the outer membrane, the I
layer of the core complex facing the inner membrane, and the
pkVirB4, protruding out of the core complex by about 85 Å (Fig.
3 A and B). The estimation of the molecular mass that could be
accommodated within the electron density protruding from the I
layer corresponds only to one molecule of pkVirB4, demonstrating that in this core-pkVirB4 complex, only one monomer of
pkVirB4 is bound. The reconstruction of the core-pkVirB4
complex is fully consistent with that of the previously determined
cryo- EM core complex structure (6) the overall structure of
which does not appear to be affected by binding of pkVirB4.
The most striking feature of the core-pkVirB4 complex
structure is that pkVirB4 binds to the side of the I layer of the
core complex. T4S ATPases were hypothesized to stack underneath the core complex (18). However, the structure presented here suggests that VirB4 instead binds on the side of the
T4S system. As expected by the presence of at least one predicted transmembrane segment (23), the electron density corresponding to pkVirB4 stretches through the inner membrane,
with pkVirB4 interfacing with the core complex on the periplasmic side and in the membrane. Because the N-terminal part
of pkVirB4 was identiﬁed to bind to the core complex (see
below), we ascribed the parts of pkVirB4 located in the membrane and the periplasm as being formed by the VirB4 NTD
(pkVirB4NTD); the part protruding in the cytoplasm and away

from the I layer was interpreted as being formed by the CTD
(pkVirB4CTD). We estimate pkVirB4NTD to be 65 Å long by 55 Å
wide and 45 Å high. Because the structure has been obtained
from the images of VirB4 attached to the core complex, the
entire reconstruction encompasses the part of the I layer to
which VirB4 binds; thus, a portion of the density can be ascribed
to VirB9 and VirB10. Part of the density on the periplasmic side,
however, protrudes laterally from the I layer and is likely to be
the part of pkVirB4NTD that binds to the core complex.
The CTD of VirB4 is linked to the NTD via two connection
links (Fig. 3 A and C, gray arrowheads). These links, which are
part of the NTD, are shaped like “columns” 7.5 Å long, with a
diameter of 15 Å. They are separated by a gap of 15 Å (Fig. 3C).
These observations are consistent either with the presence of two
transmembrane segments in the sequence of pkVirB4 or just
one, the second column being formed by interacting regions
within the NTD or between the NTD and the CTD. The CTD
itself is large and globular measuring 100 Å down the longest axis
and 70 Å at the widest point. The crystal structures of the O layer
[PDB ID 3JQO (7)] and that of TpsVirB4CTD (present study)
were docked into the negative stain structure using Chimera (35)
(Figs. 3 C and D, respectively). Correlation coefﬁcients for these
ﬁts were 0.78 and 0.93, respectively, indicating excellent ﬁts for
both, and also suggesting that the assignment of the pkVirB4
protruding density to its CTD is correct.
To examine the contribution of the NTD and CTD to the interaction with the core complex, we produced pkVirB4 constructs
encompassing either the NTD (residues 1–442; pkVirB4NTD) or the
CTD (residues 448–866; pkVirB4CTD). Coexpression of these with
the core complex and subsequent puriﬁcation resulted in the
identiﬁcation of the NTD as interacting with the core (Fig. S6).
In addition, to further characterize the binding interface, two
N-terminal deletions in pkVirB10 were produced, resulting in
pkVirB10Δ60 and pkVirB10Δ130, starting at residue 61 or 131, respectively. The ﬁrst 60 residues constitute the cytoplasmic and inner
membrane regions of the core complex and residues 61–130 constitute a long proline-rich region. The corresponding pkVirB7pkVirB9-pkVirB10Δ60 and pkVirB7-pkVirB9-pkVirB10Δ130 constructs where coexpressed with pkVirB4 and puriﬁed as for wildtype. Both shorter versions of pkVirB10 generate a core complex,
which interact with pkVirB4 (Fig. S6). We also attempted to make
VirB9-truncated variants of the core complex but none could be
stably produced. However, because the pkVirB10Δ130 deletion
removes most of the I layer part of pkVirB10 (Fig. 3), then our
results suggest that pkVirB4 interacts primarily with pkVirB9,
a protein known to reside entirely in the periplasm and decorate the
outside of the core complex (7) (also see details in Fig. S6).
It is interesting to note that residues 15–205 of TpsVirB4NTD
and residues 260–448 of pkVirB4NTD share signiﬁcant sequence
similarity (34%) and an almost identical predicted secondary
structure topology. However, Gram-positive T4S systems do not
contain the outer-membrane components of Gram-negative T4S
systems, and thus interactions involving Gram-positive VirB4s
would then have to be with inner-membrane components VirB3,
VirB6, and VirB8. Thus, in addition to interactions between
pkVirB4NTD with pkVirB9 observed here, pkVirB4NTD might
also interact with the inner-membrane components listed above
in the context of a fully assembled T4S system (see ref. 25 and
section below).
Mechanistic Implications for VirB4 as a Molecular Motor. In the
present study, we describe the crystal structure of a VirB4 protein and also provide a view of a VirB4 protein in a complex with
a T4S system core. On their own, the examined VirB4 proteins
are in a monomer-dimer equilibrium, where the monomeric
form predominates. However, bound to the core machinery,

ATPase also involved in secretion: SecA, although in a monomer-dimer equilibrium on its own, is monomeric when bound to
the SecYEG complex (30, 36). Although others and ourselves
have reported hexameric forms of VirB4 proteins (20, 23), we
are unable to reproduce these results using nanoESI-MS, a
technique considered as the gold standard for oligomerization
state studies of proteins and protein complexes (37).
Because VirB4 requires an arginine ﬁnger for activity and is
monomeric when bound to the secretion machinery, we hypothesize that the required arginine ﬁnger is then provided in
trans by another component of the machinery. There are precedents for this kind of heterologous intermolecular arginine
ﬁnger contribution, for example in complexes of small Ras-like
GTPases with GTPase-activating proteins (38).
VirB4 proteins may play essential regulatory roles in substrate
transfer (39). In the A. tumefaciens system, it does not contact
the DNA substrate directly. Instead, its ATPase activity is crucial
for substrate hand-over from VirB11 to the inner membrane
VirB6/VirB8 channel (39). VirB4 makes a number of interactions, notably with VirB3 (40), a small protein embedded in
the inner membrane, and VirB8 (19, 25). Although interaction
with VirB10 has been previously described (25, 41), the study
presented here suggests that VirB4 interacts more extensively
with VirB9 than with VirB10.
The structure of the core-VirB4 complex shows that the VirB4
motor unit is built up on the side of the core complex. Such
a location is consistent with the fact that VirB4 does not engage
directly with the substrate. Indeed, a positioning of VirB4 underneath the core complex, as was initially expected, would have
suggested a substrate gating role as VirB4 would then be
obstructing substrate entry inside the core complex: this would
have implied VirB4 making contact with the substrate, which it
does not. A side position for the VirB4 motor unit is also consistent with VirB4’s regulatory role. In that position, VirB4 would
be positioned to relay ATP-driven conformational changes to the
entire core complex through its interaction with VirB9. What
exactly these conformational changes might be and how they
might affect the structure of the core complex remains to be determined. However, a side position for VirB4 would certainly have
the potential to remodel the inner membrane complex formed by
VirB6, VirB8, and the NTD of VirB10. VirB10 is known to undergo conformational changes upon energization of the system
(42), and thus remodeling of the inner-membrane complex by
VirB4 might reconﬁgure VirB10 into an activated state.

Methods
Cloning, Protein Expression, and Puriﬁcation. All constructs were cloned,
expressed, and puriﬁed as described in SI Methods. Primers are listed in
Table S2. Core complex bound to pkVirB4 was obtained by coexpression and
double pull-down taking advantage of the Strep-tag II at the C terminus of
pkVirB10 and a His-tag at the N terminus of pkVirB4.
Limited Proteolysis, Crystallization, Data Collection, and Determination of the
Structure of TpsVirB4CTD. Ni-afﬁnity puriﬁed TpsVirB4 was reduced to its
C-terminal domain using 1/50 (wt/wt) ratio of trypsin/TpsVirB, and then
puriﬁed by gel ﬁltration. Crystals were obtained using the hanging-drop
method with a reservoir solution containing 30% (wt/vol) PEG3350; 100 mM
Bis-Tris, pH 5.75; and 200 mM ammonium sulfate. For the TpsVirB4CTD-ADP
complex, the apo form crystal was further soaked in a solution containing 20
mM of ADP-Mg but depleted of 80% of the sulfate ions. Phasing was carried
out using the single anomalous diffraction method on data collected on
Selenomethonine-substituted crystals as implemented in PHENIX (43). Data
collection and reﬁnement statistics are presented in Table S1.
ATPase Activity Assay. ATPase activities were measured using the ATPase
colorimetric assay kit from Innova Biosciences. Assays were carried out at both
37 and 60 °C because of the thermophilic origin of TpsVirB4.
Mass Spectrometry Analysis. Mass spectrometry experiments were carried out
on a Synapt HDMS (Waters) mass spectrometer (44). Sample solutions were
injected into the instrument by means of nanoESI. Typical instrumental
parameters were as follows: source pressure 6 mbar, capillary voltage 1.20
kV, cone voltage 100 V, trap energy 20 V, transfer energy 10 V, and trap
pressure 3.6 × 10−2 mbar.
Electron Microscopy and Image Processing of the Core-pkVirB4 Complex.
Samples were applied on to carbon-coated copper grids (400 mesh, freshly
glow-discharged) and stained with 2% Nano-W (methylamine tungstate).
Images were taken in a T12 electron microscope (FEI) in a defocus range of
0.7–2 mm and recorded on ﬁlms at a 42,000 nominal magniﬁcation. Films
were digitized using a Zeiss scanner with a step size corresponded to 1.67 Å/
pixel on the specimen scale. The image analysis was performed using
IMAGIC-5 (45). Preprocessing, alignment, and classiﬁcation of images was
performed as previously described (ref. 45 and references therein). Angular
orientations of class averages were determined by angular reconstitution.
Three-dimensional maps were calculated using the exact-ﬁlter back projection algorithm (45) using 330 classes for the core-pkVirB4 complex and
200 classes for the pkVirB4 structure. The resolution for both the core and
pkVirB4 was assessed using the Fourier shell correlation at the 0.5 criteria
that was 20 Å and 17 Å, respectively. (See SI Methods for details.)
