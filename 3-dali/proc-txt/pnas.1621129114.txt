n eukaryotic cells, the ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS)
degrades proteins that are misfolded, damaged, or no longer
needed (1). The 26S proteasome is a 2.5-MDa multisubunit
complex comprising the barrel-shaped 20S core particle (CP),
where degradation takes place, and one or two 19S regulatory
particles (RPs), which bind to the ends of the CP (2–4). The CP
is built of four coaxially stacked heteroheptameric rings of α- and
β-subunits in the order of αββα (5). Three of the seven β-subunits
are catalytically active; substrates are sequestered from the cellular environment in a chamber formed by the two β-rings (6, 7).
This self-compartmentalization is a hallmark of many intracellular proteases (8). Substrate access to the proteolytic chamber is
controlled by the α-subunit N-terminal extensions, forming a
gate (3). Most of proteasome activators, including the RP, contain C-terminal hydrophobic-tyrosine-X (HbYX) motifs, which
have been reported to insert into α-ring pockets, triggering gate
opening (9–11).
The RP is composed of at least 19 canonical subunits and
interacts substoichiometrically with an array of proteasomeinteracting proteins that modulate RP function (3). The RP is
divided into the “base” and the “lid” subcomplexes. The core of
the base is formed by a heterohexameric ATPase associated with
various cellular activities (AAA+ ATPase), which is the driver of
large-scale conformational dynamics of the RP. The AAA+
ATPase prepares substrates for degradation in coordination with
at least three ubiquitin receptors [26S proteasome non-ATPase
regulatory subunit 1 (Rpn1), Rpn10, and Rpn13] (12–14) and a
deubiquitylating subunit (Rpn11) (15, 16). Other subunits have
structural roles, such as holding the CP and RP together, or in
coordinating the movements needed to position the substrates
above the pore of the AAA+ ATPase for unfolding and translocation (17, 18). The AAA+ ATPase is lined by aromatic-hydrophobic loops (pore-1 loops), which grab and pull polypeptides.
Driven by ATP binding and hydrolysis, the pore-1 loops undergo
conformational changes threading the polypeptide through the central channel, similar to the mechanism postulated for the bacterial

ATP-dependent caseinolytic protease X (ClpX) (19, 20). Our
previous study revealed the existence of three distinct conformational states (21). According to their putative functions, these
states were referred to as a substrate-accepting state (s1), a
commitment state (s2), and a substrate-processing state (s3). The
major structural differences between these states are the coaxial
alignment of the AAA+ ATPase with the CP and a rotary movement
of the deubiquitylating module into a position enabling deubiquitylation. Recently, several single-particle cryo-electron microscopy
(cryo-EM) studies have described the architecture of the yeast and
human proteasome (22–25). In the presence of ATP, the majority
of the proteasomes are in an s1 or s1-like state. More states are
likely to exist, but they were not sufficiently populated to yield
high-resolution structures, and therefore precluded a detailed
understanding of the relationship between the nucleotide-bound
states and the observed conformational changes.
Here, we report cryo-EM structures of the yeast 26S proteasome in the presence of different nucleotides and nucleotide
analogs, revealing the existence of four distinct conformational
states. These structures elucidate the conformational changes
underlying substrate translocation and their coupling with gate
opening.
Significance
The 26S proteasome is a large multisubunit complex that executes the degradation of intracellular proteins marked for destruction by ubiquitylation. To understand the mechanistic
details of the functional cycle of the 26S proteasome, it is
necessary to elucidate the structural features of its “engine,”
the AAA+ ATPase module, which unfolds and translocates
substrates into the 20S core particle, where proteolysis takes
place. Here, we report cryo-electron microscopy reconstructions of the yeast 26S proteasome in the presence of different
nucleotides and nucleotide analogs. Our results provide structural insights into the mechanism of substrate unfolding and
translocation by the 26S proteasome.

BIOCHEMISTRY

In eukaryotic cells, the ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) is
responsible for the regulated degradation of intracellular proteins.
The 26S holocomplex comprises the core particle (CP), where proteolysis takes place, and one or two regulatory particles (RPs). The
base of the RP is formed by a heterohexameric AAA+ ATPase module, which unfolds and translocates substrates into the CP. Applying
single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and image classification to samples in the presence of different nucleotides and nucleotide analogs, we were able to observe four distinct conformational
states (s1 to s4). The resolution of the four conformers allowed for
the construction of atomic models of the AAA+ ATPase module as it
progresses through the functional cycle. In a hitherto unobserved
state (s4), the gate controlling access to the CP is open. The structures
described in this study allow us to put forward a model for the 26S
functional cycle driven by ATP hydrolysis.

yeast 26S proteasomes in the presence of 4 mM ATP were
recorded (Fig. S1A and Table S1). After elimination of low-quality
particles (Fig. S1 B and C), the proteasome particles were classified according to the RP states (22, 26). Ultimately, we obtained
maps of the s1 and s2 states to global resolutions of 4.1 Å and 4.5 Å,
respectively (Fig. 1 A and B and Fig. S1F). Similar to the human
26S proteasome (22), the CP exhibited local resolution values
beyond 1/4 Å−1, whereas the RP, especially the peripheral regions,
was resolved at lower than 1/8 Å−1 (Fig. S1 G and H).
We first built the model of the s1 state from a comparative
model based on the human 26S proteasome structure (22). The s2
model was obtained by molecular dynamics flexible fitting (MDFF)
(27) of the s1 model into the s2 map. The s1 and s2 structures are
overall similar to the previous models based on low-resolution
densities (21), but they exhibit subtle structural differences, such as
the register shifts as described by Schweitzer et al. (22). These
differences include a kink in the 26S proteasome ATPase regulatory subunit 1/2 (Rpt1/2) N-terminal coiled coil (Rpt1 Gly68 to
Pro78, Rpt2 Ile81 to Pro84), which was not found in the other two
coiled coils (Rpt3/6 and Rpt4/5).
Despite the overall lower resolution, Rpn13 is better resolved
in the s2 state than in the s1 state. The structure and motion of
this subunit were analyzed further by focused classification. An
exhaustive 6D correlation search in the best-resolved class (Fig.
S2A) resulted in an unambiguous positioning of Rpn13. Crosslinking mass spectrometry (MS) data validated this positioning
(Table S2). In comparison to the previous model (21), Rpn13 is
rotated by ∼105°, so that the Rpn2-binding region of Rpn13
points toward Rpn2 (28) and fulfills the cross-linking restraints.
Structures of 26S in the Presence of Different Nucleotide Analogs. To
detect additional conformations of the RP, we analyzed structures
of the 26S proteasome in the presence of different nucleotides
and nucleotide analogs [adenylyl-imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP),
ATP/ADP + beryllium fluoride (BeFx), and ADP] (Table S1).

AMP-PNP and ADP-BeFx are known as “nonhydrolyzable” nucleotide analogs that mimic an ATP ground state with tetrahedral
geometry similar to the geometry of the “slowly hydrolyzable”
nucleotide analog adenosine 5′-[γ-thio]triphosphate (ATP-γ-S)
(29). Upon 3D classification, each dataset showed different abundances of the conformational states (Fig. S3B). Although the
inhibition of the ATPase activity by AMP-PNP was weaker than
for other analogs (Fig. S3A), the class averages of the AMP-PNP
dataset showed exclusively the s3 conformation. In contrast, the
presence of ADP alone led to highly heterogeneous conformations, which could not be classified into distinct states (Table S1).
In the BeFx dataset, particles were distributed into four different
classes (Fig. S3B). One of these classes showed a previously unobserved conformation of the 26S proteasome (Fig. 2B and Fig. S4),
which we termed the s4 state. In the ADP-BeFx and ATP/BeFx
samples, the occupancy of the s4 class was, respectively, 2% and
9%. After angular refinement, the s3 and s4 maps yielded resolutions of 7.8 Å and 7.7 Å, respectively (Fig. 2 A and B and
Fig. S1F).
We modeled the s3 structure using MDFF to fit the s2 model
into the s3 density, and the s4 structure based on the resulting s3
model (Fig. S3C). Secondary structure elements like α-helices
were detected and positioned for all subunits. However, the lowresolution EM densities of the s3 and s4 states did not allow for
the unambiguous identification of side chains.

HbYX Motifs and the Gate of the CP in the Four Different States. The
diameter of the CP gate varies in the four observed conformations (Fig. S5). Consistent with previous studies (17, 26), the EM
map of the CP in the s1 state shows high densities corresponding
to the N termini of the α-subunits at the CP gate (Fig. S5 A and
B). Interestingly, we observed no clear density within the central
pore in the EM map of the s4 state (Fig. 2B, Inset, and Fig. S5 A
and C), suggesting the opening of the CP gate. To quantify gate
opening, we calculated the radial average of the EM density
perpendicular to the CP axis (Fig. S5D). The normalized intensity of the s1 state is similar to the normalized intensity of the
crystal structure of the CP with a closed gate [Protein Data Bank
(PDB) ID code 5cz4 (31)] (Fig. S5 E and G). The s4 state shows
the lowest normalized intensity at the center (Fig. S5K), in good
agreement with the open-gate CP crystal structure [PDB ID code
1z7q (32)] (Fig. S5M). In the s4 model, several residues corresponding to the EM densities of the N-terminal extension are
extended toward the RP (Fig. S5C), similar to the conformation
observed in the CP–PA26 complex (32). The normalized intensities of s2 and s3 lie in between those extrema, indicating a
partially closed gate (Fig. S5 H–J and M).
Next, we analyzed the density at the interface between the CP and
RP. In contrast to the human 26S structures (22), all three HbYX
motifs (Rpt2, Rpt3, and Rpt5) show clear densities inside the
α-pockets in the four yeast conformational states (Fig. S6A). In the
s1 structure, the conformation of the Rpt2 HbYX motif is similar to
that of the HbYX motif of the proteasome-activating nucleotidase
PAN in complex with the CP (11). The conserved tyrosine in the
Rpt2 HbYX motif is in proximity to the arginine residue of the α4
subunit (Fig. S6B). In addition to the association of the HbYX
motifs, in the s2 state, the Rpt1 C-terminal α-helix extends toward
the C terminus of the α6 subunit (Fig. S6C). In the s4 state, in addition to the three HbYX motifs, the C-terminal tail of Rpt6 was
detected at the interface between the α3 and α4 subunits (Fig. S6A).
Conformational Change of the AAA+ ATPase and the Pore Loops. In
the s1 AAA+ ATPase, the OB and AAA+ rings are stacked on top
of each other, but only the AAA+ ring forms a “lockwasher” conformation, in which the helical-shaped ring is split at the interface
between Rpt6 and Rpt3 (17, 29). The large domains of the Rpt
subunits are positioned at different heights. Rpt2 positions at the
bottom and Rpt3 at the top (Fig. S7). The AAA+ ring is further
right-handed twisted, arranging the α8 helices, which are C-terminal
of the pore-1 loop in different orientations: Rpt2 and Rpt6 tilt
inward up to 48°, and Rpt3 is almost planar with respect to the
CP plane (Fig. 3). In this arrangement, the Rpt2 pore-1 loop is
located closest to the CP and the Rpt3 pore-1 loop is proximal to
the OB ring (Fig. 3 and Fig. S7).
Compared with the s1, in the s2 state the AAA+ ATPase shifts
toward higher coaxial alignment with the CP, without significant
Wehmer et al.

local conformational changes (Fig. 3 and Figs. S4 and S7–S9), indicating that the coaxial alignment is not an ATP-driven conformational change. The AAA+ ring is rotated by ∼8° and moved by
∼17 Å for further coaxial alignment in the s3 state (Fig. S4). The
large movement of the Rpt subunits relocates the opening of the
lockwasher conformation to a site opposite of Rpt3/6, the interface
of Rpt5/1. In this conformation, the α8 helices of Rpt1 and Rpt2
are tilted outward and Rpt4 and Rpt5 inward, resulting in a
rearrangement of the pore-1 loop with Rpt5 at the bottom and
Rpt1, Rpt2, and Rpt6 at the top (Fig. 3). Finally, the s4 AAA+
ring shows only a slight shift from the s3 conformation (Fig. S4).
However, the lockwasher conformation, which splits at the interfaces between Rpt3/4 and Rpt4/5, is still preserved. In this conformation, the N termini of the α8 helices locate such that Rpt5 is
at the top position and Rpt3 is at the bottom position. In all four
conformational states, the AAA+ ATPase adopts different lockwasher conformations, which change the height of each pore-1
loop by switching the opening of the AAA+ ring.
Nucleotide-Binding Pocket and Nucleotide Binding. Like other
AAA+ ATPase family members, the nucleotide-binding pocket is
formed by five conserved motifs: Walker A, Walker B, sensor I,
sensor II, and Arg-finger. The nucleotide is located at the “interface module,” defined by a small domain of one Rpt subunit
and the large domain of its clockwise adjacent Rpt subunit (20,
33). In the s1 state, the interface module units are closely connected to each other, except at the split site between Rpt6 and
Rpt3 (Fig. 4D). Similar to previous studies (22, 24, 25), the s1
map shows density for nucleotides in all six nucleotide-binding
pockets (Fig. 4 A, F, and G). However, only five of the six Argfingers are engaged in nucleotide binding (“engaged pocket”), in
which the phosphates (Pi) of the nucleotide interact with the side
chains of the two Arg residues of the Arg-finger (Fig. 4A). In the
engaged pockets, the distance between the N-terminal tip of
the α6 helix at the Walker A motif and the center of α10 helix
located after the walker B motif (“pocket distance”) is ∼4–5 Å,
showing tight ATP binding (Fig. 4 C and D). In contrast, the
pocket distance of the interface module Rpt6/3 is ∼30 Å (Fig.
4D). Interestingly, the Rpt3 Arg-fingers are projected away from
the nucleotide-binding pocket and form hydrogen bonds with the
carboxy groups of Rpt6, Glu140, and Val141 (“open pocket”)
(Fig. 4 A and C). Despite nonengagement of the Rpt3 Arg-finger,
there is still nucleotide density in the Rpt6/3 pocket. Indeed, the
density volume of the Rpt6/3 pocket is smaller than the nucleotide
densities of the rest of the subunits, implying ADP binding (22).
The conformations of the binding pockets in the s2 state are
identical to the conformations of the binding pockets in the s1 state
(Fig. 4 B and G), supporting the notion that there is no ATP hydrolysis involved in the conformational change from s1 to s2 (Figs.
S8 and S9). Interestingly, we identified nucleotide densities in all
Rpt subunits in both the s3 and s4 states (Fig. 4G). Similar to the
s1/s2 states, the interface modules of the s3 and s4 states are in
close contact with each other, except for the split sites, probably for
tight ATP binding (Fig. 4 A–D). In the s3 state, the pocket distance
of Rpt5/1, which is localized at the split site, is longer than the
others (∼28 Å), indicating a different coordination of the nucleotide
from the coordination in the engaged pockets. In the s4 state,
the pockets of two subunits, Rpt3/4 and Rpt4/5, are expanded
(∼21 Å) (Fig. 4D). Considering that the pocket distance probably
corresponds to different nucleotide binding, the conformational
changes between s2, s3, and s4 may reflect different nucleotide
binding by the AAA+ ATPase.

Discussion
Here, we present four different conformational states of the yeast
26S proteasome obtained in the presence of different nucleotides
and nucleotide analogs. One of the states represents a previously
unobserved s4 conformation in which the lockwasher conformation
of the AAA+ ATPase is rearranged to position the pore-1 loop
differently from the three other known states. The four conformers
provide insights into the functional cycle of the ATPase module

Structural Features of the s4 Conformation. Although, overall, the
s4 structure seems similar to the s3 structure, some subunits,
such as Rpn1, Rpn6, Rpn11, and the AAA+ ATPase, adopt
different conformations (Fig. 2C). For example, compared with
the s3 conformer, the N-terminal α-solenoid of Rpn6 moves by
∼12 Å toward Rpn7, independent of the overall rotation of the
lid complex, whereas Rpn11 shifts by ∼11 Å together with the
entire oligosaccharide-binding (OB) ring. The rigid-body rotation of Rpn1 from s3 to s4 positions the Rpn1 N terminus ∼24 Å
closer to the AAA+ ring (Fig. S3 E and F). Compared with the s1
state, Rpn1 shifts and rotates in the s4 state, leading to an interaction of its N terminus with Rpt2 and Rpt6. This conformational
change increases the distance between the central leucine-rich repeats domain of Rpn1 and the coiled coil of Rpt4/5, which might
facilitate Ubp6 binding (Fig. S3F). Indeed, we observed an additional density between Rpn1 and the OB ring in the s4 state (Fig.
2B, box), which coincides with the position of Ubp6 (30). Further
focused classification of the s4 dataset revealed that ∼50% of the
particles do not possess Ubp6 (Fig. S3D), roughly consistent with
the amount of Ubp6 in the sample determined by MS.

and its role in substrate translocation: (i) The AAA+ ring changes
the positions of the split site of the lockwasher conformation, which
leads to rearrangements of the pore-1 loop; (ii) all six nucleotidebinding pockets are occupied, although the Arg-fingers are not
engaged in all sites; (iii) the conformational change of the AAA+
ATPase is coupled with the CP gate opening; and (iv) three HbYX
motifs constitutively bind to the α-pockets of the CP.
Substrate Translocation in the Lockwasher Conformation. The
AAA+ ATPase family belongs to an additional strand catalytic
glutamate (ASCE) superfamily, which includes RecA-like ATPases (33). Despite the high degree of structural conservation among
the members of the ASCE superfamily (33), there are major differences in their hexameric assemblies. ClpX assembles into a
closed planar ring but breaks symmetry by rotating the hinge region between the small and large domains of a subunit to form an
“unloadable” conformation (34). The RecA ATPase DNA helicases, Rho and E1, also have a planar conformation, whereas
DnaB6 is assembled into a lockwasher conformation (35). In the
yeast 26S AAA+ ATPase, all four structures adopt a lockwasher
conformation with different split sites. So far, the only planar
conformation of the 26S proteasome was found in the presence of
a model ubiquitylated substrate, in which the pore-1 loops were
suggested to be arranged in a plane (36). In the substrate-engaged
structure, the position of the AAA+ ring with respect to the CP is
similar to the positions of the s3 and s4 conformers. However, the
conformation of each Rpt subunit, including the arrangement of
the pore-1 loop, is rather close to the s3 state. In the lockwasher
conformation, the elongated pitch of the pore-1 loop may allow
the ATPase to translocate polypeptides with a larger distance than
the planar conformation. The distance between the top and bottom positions of the pore-1 loops of the 26S proteasome is ∼2 nm,
almost double the ClpX substrate translocation step size (37). This
finding indicates that the proteasome pore-1 loops in the staircase
arrangement can likely translocate a polypeptide with a similar or
even larger step size than ClpX.
In all reported conformations of the 26S proteasome, including
the “open-gate” conformation (SD conformation) (22–25), the
AAA+ ATPase adopts a lockwasher conformation. However,
we note that the lockwasher conformation of the AAA+ ATPase
and the staircase arrangement of the pore-1 loops in the s4 state
are not similar to the SD conformation or any other reported
conformation.

CP Gate-Opening Mechanisms. A previous structural study showed
that insertion of the C-terminal HbYX motifs causes a conformational change for the CP gate opening concomitant with a rotation of the α-subunits (11). Although our s4 map shows no clear
density in the pore region, probably representing an open-gate
state, we did not observe any significant rotation of the α-subunits:
Only the N-terminal extensions turn up toward the RP, as seen in the
PA26–CP complex (38). In contrast, a strong density within the
gate in the s1 state (Fig. S5A) suggests a closed gate. In the s2 and
s3 states, the normalized intensity within the gate is between the
normalized intensities of s1 and s4, indicating incomplete gate
opening. In the crystal structure of the CP with the proteasome
activator Blm10, the N-terminal extensions were not in the closed
conformation but did not show a clear density, suggesting a
“partial closed-gate” (10). The gate conformation of the s2 and s3
states may be similar to such a partial closed-gate state. Considering the elasticity of an unfolded polypeptide (39), the partial
closed-gate may hinder the diffusion of the translocated polypeptide by gripping it with the N-terminal extensions. In addition, the fact that all four states exhibit densities of three HbYX
motifs in the α-pockets but only the s4 conformation adopts an
open-gate conformation, suggests that HbYX engagement is not
sufficient to open the gate for the yeast 26S proteasome.
The reported SD conformation of the human 26S proteasome
showed a reduced density within the gate. However, analysis of
the normalized intensity of the SD conformation (Fig. S5L)
shows that the gate area is rather similar to the s3 state (Fig.
S5O), implying that the SD state represents a conformation different from the s4 state. In the SD conformation, two additional
C-terminal tails (Rpt1 and Rpt6), together with insertion of the
three HbYX motifs into the α-pockets, were suggested to trigger
CP gate opening (25). However, only the C-terminal tail of Rpt6
was detected in the map of the s4 state (Fig. S6A). Due to the
relatively low resolution of the s4 and SD states, it is unclear whether
this difference is due to a different gate-opening mechanism in yeast
and humans or to different interpretation of the EM maps.
Functional Model. Mechanochemical studies of ClpX have revealed
that a conformational change of the pore-1 loop is coupled with Pi
release to power translocation (39). In addition, among the six
protomers, a subunit whose pore-1 loop is in direct contact with a
translocated polypeptide may have a higher probability of hydrolyzing ATP first (40), indicating that an Rpt subunit at the top of
the staircase may hydrolyze first. Interestingly, the pore-1 loop of
the Rpt subunit at the top of the staircase is adjacent to the Rpt
Wehmer et al.

subunit with an open nucleotide-binding pocket, in which the
pore-1 loop is located at the bottom of the staircase.
Based on our structures, we propose the following functional
model of the 26S proteasome (Fig. S10). In the absence of
substrate, the proteasome is present in the ground state (s1),
which represents the lowest energy conformation of the four
states. When the proteasome is activated, most likely by substrate binding, it undergoes a conformational change from the
ground state to the translocation-competent states (s2–s4). Because no structural change is observed in the AAA+ ring between
s1 and s2, this transition is most likely not ATP-dependent. The
translocation of substrates may be initiated by Rpt3, whose pore1 loop is at the top position of the staircase in the s2 state.
Polypeptide binding to the Rpt3 pore-1 loop may trigger ATP
hydrolysis, probably followed by Pi release. The Pi release from
the Rpt3/4 pocket brings the Rpt3 pore-1 loop to the bottom of
the staircase. As a consequence, the pockets of the neighboring
subunits (Rpt3/4 and Rpt4/5) undergo a conformational change,
resulting in the relocation of the Rpt5 pore-1 loop at the top position (s4). A concerted conformational change occurs to open the CP
gate, which allows substrate translocation into the CP antechamber.
Coupling the gate opening with ATP hydrolysis prevents the polypeptide from slipping back. In a similar manner, the Rpt5 pore-1
Wehmer et al.

loop undergoes a conformational change coupled with Pi release to
be located at the bottom of the staircase (s3), again powering the
work for the translocation. It is very likely that there exists more
states than the four discussed here, in which the nucleotide pockets
of Rpt1/2 and 2/6 are open. We assume that the cycle continues until
the substrate translocation process is finished. Our structures favor a
model in which the hydrolysis cycle occurs in a sequential order
around the ring rather than in a stochastic manner.
Materials and Methods
Purification and Characterization of 26S Proteasome. Yeast 26S proteasomes
were isolated from Saccharomyces cerevisae by affinity purification using the
3× FLAG-tagged subunit Rpn11. Different ATP analogs were introduced during or after the sucrose gradient purification step (SI Materials and Methods).
Samples (∼1 mg/mL) were stored at −80 °C until further use.
Data Acquisition and Image Processing. All datasets were collected on a Titan
Krios with a direct electron detector in movie mode. The pixel size at the
specimen level was 1.35 Å for Falcon cameras and 1.38 Å for the K2 camera (SI
Materials and Methods). Both single-capped 26S and double-capped particles
were used in all datasets for classification and to obtain the final reconstructions
(SI Materials and Methods). All image processing steps were carried out in TOM
(41) and RELION (42).

Model Building. Initial models were obtained by comparative and de novo
modeling (SI Materials and Methods). The initial structure for the s1 state was
the merged structure of the CP crystal structure [PDB ID code 5cz4 (31)] and
the RP homology model based on the human structure [PDB ID code 5l4g
(22)]. The subunits were positioned into the EM map and subsequently refined. Real-space refinement was first performed as described by Goh et al.
(43) using MDFF (27) and then in reciprocal space. MDFF simulations were
prepared using QwikMD (44), analyzed with VMD (45), and carried out with
NAMD (46). The refined final structure of s1 was used to initiate an MDFF run
into the density of the s2 state. The final refined structure of the s2 state was
fitted through MDFF into the density of the s3 state, and the final s3 state
structure was finally fitted into the s4 density.
