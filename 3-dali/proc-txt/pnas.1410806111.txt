Mobile genetic elements in bacteria are neutralized by a system
based on clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats
(CRISPRs) and CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins. Type I CRISPR-Cas
systems use a “Cascade” ribonucleoprotein complex to guide RNA
specifically to complementary sequence in invader double-stranded
DNA (dsDNA), a process called “interference.” After target recognition by Cascade, formation of an R-loop triggers recruitment of
a Cas3 nuclease-helicase, completing the interference process by
destroying the invader dsDNA. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of CRISPR interference, we analyzed crystal structures of Cas3
from the bacterium Thermobaculum terrenum, with and without
a bound ATP analog. The structures reveal a histidine-aspartate
(HD)-type nuclease domain fused to superfamily-2 (SF2) helicase
domains and a distinct C-terminal domain. Binding of ATP analog
at the interface of the SF2 helicase RecA-like domains rearranges
a motif V with implications for the enzyme mechanism. The HDnucleolytic site contains two metal ions that are positioned at the
end of a proposed nucleic acid-binding tunnel running through the
SF2 helicase structure. This structural alignment suggests a mechanism for 3′ to 5′ nucleolytic processing of the displaced strand of
invader DNA that is coordinated with ATP-dependent 3′ to 5′ translocation of Cas3 along DNA. In agreement with biochemical studies,
the presented Cas3 structures reveal important mechanistic details on
the neutralization of genetic invaders by type I CRISPR-Cas systems.

any bacteria and archaea can eliminate invading phages
and plasmids by activating a defense system that is based
on processing of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic
repeats (CRISPRs) by CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins and
various additional proteins. These CRISPR-Cas systems are diverse in structure and function, but common principles of action
allow their classification into three major types (I, II, and III) with
some further divisions into subtypes (e.g., type IA–F) (1–6).
Common CRISPR-mediated immunity processes are usually
defined into three stages: (i) acquisition of a short DNA segment
(protospacer) from an invading virus or plasmid, and its insertion
at the leader-proximal end of a CRISPR locus (7, 8), (ii) generation of small mature CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) from a longer
transcript of a CRISPR locus (9–11), and (iii) interference of
foreign nucleic acid invaders by a crRNA-containing ribonucleoprotein effector complex (12–18).
Different interference effector complexes characterize the three
major CRISPR types. Cascade (Cas complex for antiviral defense)
complexes are synonymous with interference in type I CRISPRs,
comprising multiple proteins in a helical structure around crRNA
that targets invader DNA (13, 19, 20). Type II CRISPR systems
are characterized by Cas9, a multidomain protein with a bilobed
architecture harboring two nuclease sites that together catalyze
cleavage of invading DNA (12, 21–24). The Csm system in
CRISPR type IIIA and a related Cmr complex in type IIIB cleave
DNA and RNA, respectively, forming a helical structure around
crRNA that is structurally similar to Cascade (14, 17, 18, 25, 26).
Whereas Cas9 and Csm/Cmr effector complexes directly recognize and nucleolytically degrade invading genes (12, 14, 16, 17,

www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1410806111

21), Cascade complex by itself is not a nuclease for degradation
of invader DNA (13). In Escherichia coli K-12 (type IE), Cascade
recognizes and binds crRNA to complimentary sequence in
target DNA, generating an RNA mediated displacement loop
(R-loop) of single-stranded (ss) DNA and RNA-DNA hybrid
within double-stranded (ds) target DNA (13). Formation of the
R-loop structure induces conformational change in Cascade
subunits, triggering recruitment of Cas3 protein that is a nuclease-helicase responsible for degradation of dsDNA (27–30).
The two enzymatic units of Cas3, a histidine-aspartate (HD)
nuclease and a Superfamily 2 (SF2) helicase (31), may be expressed
from separate genes as Cas3′ (SF2 helicase) and Cas3′′ (HD nuclease) or may be fused as a single HD-SF2 polypeptide (32).
Variation in optimal reaction conditions have also been reported,
especially in cofactor requirements and substrate specificities of
HD-nuclease. Streptococcus thermophilus type IE Cas3 degrades
ssDNA in the presence of magnesium and transition metal ions,
and uses ATP hydrolysis to translocate DNA strands with 3′ to
5′ directionality (33). Methanocaldococcus jannaschii type IA
Cas3 HD nuclease cleaves ssDNA with magnesium dependence
both endo-nucleolytically and 3′ to 5′ exonucleolytically, and
ssRNA in the presence of Mn2+ ions (34). Thermus thermophilus
HB8 type IE Cas3′′ HD nuclease degrades ssDNA endo-nucleolytically with Mn2+ or Ni2+ ions (35). Significantly for understanding
CRISPR interference, E. coli type IE Cas3 protein catalyzes Mg2+ ionand transition metal ion-dependent nicking of the displaced strand
of the target dsDNA, after which ATP-dependent unwinding of
the target allows for the 3′ to 5′ processive nuclease activity on
the nicked ssDNA (28, 29, 33, 35, 36). Overall, the data suggests
Significance
Bacteria can repel invader DNA and RNA molecules by using an
adaptive immunity mechanism called clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs)-Cas. CRISPR loci in
a host genome are a repository of DNA fragments obtained from
previous encounters with an invader, which can be transcribed
and activated into short RNA molecules (crRNA) with sequences
complementary to invader DNA or RNA. In some CRISPR-Cas
systems, crRNA is assembled into a targeting complex called
“Cascade” that seeks invader DNA to form an R-loop that triggers
recruitment of a nuclease-helicase, Cas3, to destroy invader DNA.
In this study, we show atomic resolution structures of a fulllength Cas3, revealing how Cas3 coordinates binding, ATPdependent translocation, and nuclease digestion of invader DNA.

the dATP cofactor is bound at the interface of the two RecA-like
domains (RDs). Interestingly, the HD nucleolytic active site is
aligned with a predicted nucleic acid-binding tunnel running
through the helicase domains. The molecular basis of DNA binding
and unwinding by Cas3, and a protein module that is potentially
involved in the interaction with the Cascade effector complex, can
be predicted and inferred from the two structures. By reconciling
these structures with previously reported biochemical features of
Cas3, we propose a mechanistic model for Cas3 that includes (i)
recruitment of the Cas3 to the Cascade-bound target DNA, (ii)
endo-nucleolytic cleavage of the displaced DNA strand, and (iii)
progressive 3′ to 5′ exonucleolytic degradation of the displaced
strand and concomitant unwinding of the dsDNA target.

homologs had suggested that Cas3 from T. terrenum (TteCas3) is
a dual function nuclease-helicase enzyme, with an N-terminal HD
nuclease domain fused to SF2 helicase domains (Fig. 1 and Fig.
S1). Crystal structures of full-length TteCas3, with and without an
ATP analog, were solved at resolutions of 2.8 Å and 2.5 Å, respectively (Table 1), and confirmed this general arrangement,
throughout displayed with the HD nuclease domain at the upper
end of the structure residing atop SF2 helicase domains and
a distinct exposed C-terminal domain (CTD) (Fig. 2A).

that nucleolytic activity of most Cas3 enzymes is transition metal
ion-dependent.
A lack of structural information on the Cas3 SF2 helicase and
how it might coordinate functions with the HD nuclease domain
have hindered understanding of interference in type I CRISPR
immunity. Here, we present crystal structures of a full length
HD-SF2 Cas3 from Thermobaculum terrenum, which has the type
IE CRISPR-Cas system (Fig. S1A). Structures are solved for
Cas3 both with an adenosine triphosphate analog (dATP-bound)
and without dATP (dATP-free). The N-terminal HD nuclease
contains an active site that is composed of two metal ions, and

The N-Terminal HD-Type Nuclease. The N-terminal HD domain of
the full-length TteCas3 (Ser20-Val282, blue in Figs. S1B and 2A)
superimposes well with HD structure of the truncated Cas3 from
T. thermophilus HB8, with root mean square deviation (rmsd) of
1.72 Å for the 230 aligned Cα-atoms (PDB ID code: 3SK9; Fig.
S2A) (34, 35). Based on the conserved residues of the nuclease
domain of TteCas3 (Fig. 1) and its divalent metal ion-dependent
nucleolytic activity (Fig. S2), two of the three spherical electron
densities within the HD catalytic site are assumed to correspond
to Mn2+ or Ni2+ ions (Mn1 and Mn2) and the third one to
a water molecule (w1) (Fig. 2B). The Mn1 ion is coordinated
with the w1 water molecule and four atoms of protein ligands,

The ATPase Site. The ATP-binding site at the interface cleft of two
RecA-like domains (RDs) was revealed from the cocrystal
structure of TteCas3 and dATP (Fig. 2D). This site is similar to
that of the yeast DEAD-box RNA helicase Mss116p (PDB ID
code: 3I5Y; Mss Hel in Fig. S3A) (37), a closely related structural homolog with two RDs as in TteCas3 helicase (Z score
18.7) and an rmsd value of 3.12 Å for the 281 aligned Cα atoms.
All three phosphate groups of bound dATP are observed in the
dATP-complex structure, with extra electron density in the vicinity
of the β- and γ-phosphates that was modeled with a Mg2+ ion
(Mg) (Fig. 2D). Bound dATP interacts with residues of helicase

of two RDs is displayed by line models in the omitted Fo-Fc difference map

motifs I, II, IV, V, and VI (Figs. S1B and 2D). Mutation of Cas3
motif II (DExD/H, alignment in Fig. 1B), to give protein D477A,
resulted in abolition of ssDNA-stimulated ATPase activity,
whereas ATPase activity was intact when the HD-nuclease mutation D237A was present (Figs. S3B and 2E). Comparison of
dATP-bound and dATP-free structures shows no overall gross
structural change in Cas3 (rmsd value of 0.5 Å for all Cα atoms),
but significant focused structural changes were observed around
the ATPase site involving relative positioning of helicase motifs Ia
and V (Fig. S3C). In the dATP-free structure, Ser669 of motif
V contacts motif Ia, but this interaction disappears when dATP is
bound, as the cofactor hydrogen bonds to Asp671 of motif V (Fig.
2D). ATP-induced structural changes in motif V are important for
coupling ATPase activity with nucleic acid binding and translocation in helicases as revealed by mechanistic studies on the NS3
helicase (38, 39), which is structurally similar to TteCas3, as discussed below. It is interesting to note that although the motif
V Asp (Asn) residue is well conserved in Cas3 proteins, the serine
residue is conserved only in the IE subtype and is replaced
by glycine in Cas3 protein from other subtypes (Fig. S4).
Structural Features of the TteCas3 Helicase. A structural homology
search using both TteCas3 RD domains identified good superimposition with RD domains of archaeal Hel308 DNA helicase (rmsd
3.03 Å, PDB ID code: 2P6R) and flavivirus NS3 RNA helicase
(rmsd 2.82 Å, PDB ID code: 2JLU), despite their low overall sequence identity (18 and 11% for the compared 273 and 224 residues of Hel308 and NS3 RD domains, respectively). Both Hel308
and NS3 helicases form a tunnel to accommodate single-stranded
nucleic acid, binding of which induces slight rearrangement of two
RDs and the CTD, but significant reordering of helicase motif Ic
(40, 41) (Fig. S5). In TteCas3 helicase, three domains (RD1, RD2,
and CTD) form a similar tunnel, lined by motifs Ia, Ib, IV, and VI,
and an invariant tryptophan (Trp432) and a Phe433 (WF) on the
RD1 and RD2 surface (gray patches in Fig. 3A). Mutations of the
invariant WF residues of RD1 motif Ic resulted in decreased
binding and nucleolytic activities on the 72-mer ssDNA substrate,
compared with wild-type TteCas3 (Fig. 2C).
Several conserved positively charged patches are present in
the vicinity of the tunnel and in the above mentioned sequence
motifs (Figs. 3B and 1). Moreover, the average diameter of this
tunnel is wide enough to accommodate single-stranded nucleic
acids, which is consistent with TteCas3’s specific binding activity
of ssRNA and ssDNA (Fig. S2C). Positioning of this tunnel
relative to the nuclease active site is suggestive that it guides
ssDNA generated at the point of helicase unwinding toward its
destruction in the HD domain. A protruded β-hairpin (β17 and
β18 in Fig. S1B) from Cas3 RD2 is at a structurally equivalent
position to the hairpin-unwinding elements of Hel308 and NS3
(40, 41) (Fig. 3C and Fig. S5), suggesting a similar role in unwinding double-stranded nucleic acids. The β-hairpin is proximal
to motif V, which is positioned for ATP binding, consistent with
a coupling mechanism for ATPase-powered DNA translocation
that is observed in structural studies of NS3 (39) and Hel308
(37). In the TteCas3 structure, a short α-helix (α33) is located
between the hairpin and motif V and this helix may be part of
a ratchet-like translocation mechanism involving conformational
movement of RDs, as discussed further later.
Some unique features of TteCas3 might be relevant for its
enzymatic mechanism in CRISPR interference. First, motif Ic is
composed of fewer than 10 residues in NS3 and Hel308 helicases, whereas it is elongated to 80 residues in TteCas3 (Ser395Thr471; α20-α24 and β5; Figs. S1B and S4). The significance of
this elongation may arise from positioning of TteCas3 motif Ic at
the interface of HD nuclease and the CTD (Fig. 3D), providing
interdomain stabilization through hydrophobic and hydrophilic
interactions. Additionally, motif Ic α21-helix and an adjacent
Gly413-Gly420 loop partly covers the HD nuclease active site
(Fig. 3D). A second unusual feature of TteCas3 is that the tunnel
formed by the helicase domains that is proposed to accommodate ssDNA may be at least partially occluded by a weakly traced

corresponding to side chains of Asp99, His138, His171, and
His172. The Mn2 ion interacts with amino acid side chains of
His52, His98, Asp99, and Asp237, and with the w1 molecule that
is hydrogen-bonded to the side-chain atom of Asp237. TteCas3
D237A mutant protein had no observable nuclease activity when
incubated with ssDNA, and compared with wild-type TteCas3, it
had reduced ability to bind to ssDNA (Fig. 2C and Fig. S2B),
implicating a role in both ssDNA-binding and nuclease activity.
The involvement of Asp237 in the nucleolytic activity is consistent with it being part of the metal-dependent active site for
nucleic acid cleavage, in agreement with previous analysis of the
Cas3′′ HD domain of M. jannaschii and the truncated HD domain of T. thermophilus HB8 (34, 35).

linker region of α36-helix and the CTD (Ser821-Glu842; a blackdotted line in Fig. 2). The length of this linker is diverse among
Cas3 proteins, but its sequence is relatively well conserved (Figs.
S1B and S4). Despite these differences, the overall structural
features of the RDs of the TteCas3 helicase are very similar to
those of Hel308 and NS3 helicases (Fig. 3C), strongly suggesting
that Cas3 enzymes use an ATP-dependent translocation mechanism typical of NS3 and Hel308 SF2 helicases.
Functional Implication of the Cas3 C-Terminal Domain. The 100residue CTD of TteCas3 has a globular β-sandwich structure
flanked by three α-helices (Fig. 2A). A structural homology
search revealed highest similarity to the 60 residues of ubiquitinlike protein SMT3 (PDB ID code: 3TIX). Although the two
domains share the same folding topology, their structural homology is low (Z score: 3.5) and their sequence identity is 13%
for the aligned 60 residues with an rmsd value of 2.7 Å. The conserved residues are located at the hydrophobic core of the globular
domain, suggesting importance in structural integrity but that the
functions of Cas3 CTD and SMT3 are otherwise unrelated.
Helicase CTDs have frequently been suggested either to recruit
partner proteins/complexes or to facilitate recognition of specific
nucleic acid sequences (40–42). Some Cas3 proteins are predicted
to exist as fusions with Cse1 protein (Cas subtype E. coli protein-1,
also referred to as CasA), a subunit of Cascade interference
complex. Cas3-targeting invader DNA colocalizes with Cse1 in the
E. coli Cascade complex (30). Additionally, a synthetic E. coli
Cas3-Cse1 fusion protein, linked between Cas3 C terminus and
Cse1 N terminus, was catalytically active and formed a functional
complex with the other four subunits of Cascade (28). Based on
these factors, we propose that the Cas3 CTD might be the region
responsible for interaction with Cse1. However, attempts to detect
such an interaction with mixtures of two independently purified
16362 | www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1410806111

proteins of Cas3 and Cse1 from T. terrenum have not been successful (Fig. S6A) and similar results were obtained with mixtures
of Cse1 and the truncated TteCas3 CTD (841–944; Fig. S6B).
These results may suggest that stable docking of Cas3 and Cse1
requires other components of Cascade complex, perhaps to induce
the conformational change that is observed in Cse1 within Cascade when DNA is bound (13, 43). It is also possible that a defined
R-loop structure needs to be present to facilitate correct orientation of Cascade to allow Cas3–Cse1 interaction or other Cascade subunits are partly involved in the formation of a stable
complex with Cas3. Interestingly, a synthetic Cas5-Cas3 fusion
protein in type IB system degraded nucleic acids, suggesting that
nuclease domain is located close to Cas5 (6), which contacts Cse1
in the crRNA–Cascade complex (43).
Discussion
In this study, we report the first crystal structures, to our knowledge, of a full-length Cas3 protein with complete HD-SF2 fusion,
with and without bound ATP analog (dATP). A tunnel covered
with surface residues that would allow for ssDNA binding within
the helicase domains are aligned such that a target DNA strand is
directed straight into the HD nucleolytic core (Fig. 3A). This
domain arrangement suggests a coordinated pathway within Cas3
that passes unwound ssDNA to the HD active site through the
combined activities of ATP hydrolysis, ssDNA translocation and
duplex strand separation, and 3′ to 5′ exonucleolytic cleavage. By
this mechanism, Cas3 would complete CRISPR interference by
destroying at least one strand of invader dsDNA.
Based on our analyses, together with reported information,
a detailed mechanism for ssDNA cleavage and dsDNA unwinding by Cas3 is proposed (Fig. 4). After recognition of an
appropriate PAM motif by Cse1 (30), the crRNA–Cascade
complex unwinds invading dsDNA in a step-wise manner (44),
eventually generating an R-loop conformation with a displaced
noncomplementary DNA strand and a complementary DNA
strand that base pairs with the crRNA guide (28) (Fig. 4A). A
conformational change of the Cascade subunit Cse1 most likely
triggers recruitment of Cas3 (30, 43). The complex formation
reveals a previously concealed nucleic acid-binding cleft on two
RDs in the region of the α36-helix and the CTD and exposes the
partly hidden HD nuclease active site by displacing the α19-helix
and the associated loop of helicase motif Ic. The displaced
noncomplementary ssDNA can then be located to the nucleic
acid-binding cleft on the RD1 and RD2 surface (Fig. 4B).
Binding of ssDNA to the HD nucleolytic core, via the Ic-motif
and conserved residues Lys437, Lys460, His461, and Arg465
(Figs. S1B and S4), will initially invoke endo-nucleolytic cleavage
of the noncomplementary ssDNA (Fig. 4C), possibly at residues
between the 7th and 11th nucleotide into the protospacer (29,
30). Upon nicking, rearrangement of the CTD transforms the
cleft into a tunnel, ensuring stable binding of the DNA strand
(Fig. 4D). Binding of an ATP molecule to the RD1-RD2 interface of Cas3 induces a conformational change of motif V,
resulting in relocation of motif Ia toward the ATPase site. ATP
hydrolysis and ADP release will complete the cycle and rearrange these two motifs to their original spatial positions of the
ATP-free state. During the cycle of ATP binding and ATP hydrolysis, the released energy is used (i) to drive the step-wise
translocation of Cas3 along the nicked, displaced DNA strand
into 3′ to 5′ direction, and (ii) to drive the step-wise unwinding of
the dsDNA probably by using the β-hairpin (β17 and β18) as
a wedge-like structural element as is the case in the related SF2
helicase Hel308. Concomitantly, the transferred 3′-end of the
displaced DNA is exposed to the HD nuclease site, where it is
progressively degraded in 3′ to 5′ direction by exonucleolytic
activity of Cas3 (Fig. 4D). Based on the observation that Cas3
has the capacity to bind ssDNA, together with the demonstration
that Cas3 can catalyze ATP-dependent unwinding of a crRNA/
ssDNA hetero duplex (33, 45), it has been proposed that, although one Cas3 progressively processes the displaced DNA
strand, another Cas3 molecule may release the crRNA–Cascade

crRNA in Cascade forms an RNA-DNA hybrid duplex by base-pairing to the
complementary DNA strand of invading dsDNA, resulting in displacement of the
noncomplementary DNA strand. (B) Cas3 recruitment. The Cas3 CTD is proposed
to interact with the Cse1 subunit, which opens the nucleic acid-binding cleft on
RD1 and RD2 and exposes the HD core. The displaced DNA strand is bound
by the nucleic acid-binding cleft on the RD1 and RD2 surface. (C) Initial endonucleolytic cleavage of the displaced DNA strand. The probable dsDNAunwinding β-hairpin wedge is indicated with a filled triangle. Tight binding of
ssDNA by residues at the interface of RD1 and in the vicinity of HD core invokes
an initial nicking. (D) Processive exonucleolytic cleavage of the ssDNA and dsDNA
unwinding. CTD rearranges, resulting in formation of a tunnel structure to trap
the cleaved fragment of the ssDNA. ATPase-driven conformational changes drive
the translocation of the Cas3 protein along the nicked DNA strand into the 3′ to
5′ direction, whereas dsDNA is further unwound. The ssDNA is degraded in
a step-wise manner by 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity. (E) Cascade targets invading

complex from the target DNA strand (Fig. 4E) and bind to the
other strand for an endo-nucleolytic attack. Cas3-dATP binding
was accompanied by structural rearrangement of motif V
reminiscent of events in the translocation mechanism of the SF2
helicase NS3 (39). Translocation by NS3 includes nucleotidedependent conformational movement of RDs orientating the
helicase into “open” and “closed” positions that contribute to
“ratchet-like” movement along ssDNA. Cas3-dATP lacked similar movement of RD1 and RD2 relative to nucleotide-free
structures, but it is possible that DNA binding, in addition to
nucleotide binding, is required to allow Cas3 RD1-RD2 movement, as observed for NS3 (39). Hel308 SF2 helicase is also
thought to translocate ssDNA ratchet-like by conformational
movement of RDs in response to nucleotide binding (40), and it
is proposed that Cas3 conforms to this general principle of
translocation by SF2 helicases.
From the analysis of the reported cleavage patterns, it was
suggested that Cas3 has endo- nucleolytic and exonucleolytic

activities (33, 34). Several products of different size from the
dsDNA substrate of partial duplex that has a 5′-end–labeled
ssDNA region indicates that the endo-nucleolytic activity of Cas3
appears not to be processive. Simultaneously, their cleavage patterns in the absence of ATP were provided as evidence for Cas3’s
exonucleolytic activity. However, these exonucleolytic products
may not result from processive degradation because one would
not expect the translocation activity of Cas3 without ATP, suggesting that its exonucleolytic activity is also, at least to some
extent, distributive. To resolve this issue, future studies are required on Cas3 in complex with Cascade and/or R loop to understand precise mechanisms of DNA interference by type I Cascade/
Cas3 complexes.
While this paper was in revision, the crystal structure of an irondependent Cas3 from Thermobifida fusca (TfusCas3) was published
in complex with ssDNA derived from the expression host (46). In
TfusCas3, ssDNA binding causes differences in relative orientation
of RD2 and CTD compared with the structure we observe in
TteCas3 (Fig. S7A), and significantly, the α21-helix WF motif is
rotated almost 90° from the HD domain, exposing the HD core to
the bound ssDNA (Fig. S7B). This observation is in full agreement
with the aforementioned prediction for TteCas3. Our mutational
studies on TteCas3 (D237A and the WF motif) showed decreased
ssDNA binding and cleavage activities, which has not been reported
in TfusCas3. TteCas3 WF motif is present as WL in TfusCas3, and,
although WL does not contact DNA, it contributes to both formation of the stable nucleic acid-binding pocket near the HD core
and correct positioning of conserved positively charged residues that
do contact DNA. Therefore, the complementary studies on two fulllength bacterial Cas3 proteins provide a major gain of insight in the
molecular mechanism of type I CRISPR-Cas interference.
Materials and Methods
Cloning and Protein Production. The gene encoding full-length TteCas3 was
amplified by PCR from a template of chromosomal DNA from T. terrenum,
using primers designed for ligation-independent cloning (47). The PCR
product was treated with T4 DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) and
inserted into a vector derived from the pET21a plasmid (Novagen). This
vector was designed to express the cloned gene fused to a (His)6 tag, and the
Tobacco etch virus cleavage sequence at the N terminus. The E. coli BL21 Star
(DE3) Solu strain transformed with the expression construct was grown in
the Luria Bertani medium. After induction by adding 0.5 mM isopropyl β-D-1thiogalactoside, cells were cultivated for 15 h at 37 °C. The harvested cells
were resuspended and disrupted by ultrasonication in a buffer solution
containing 20 mM Tris·HCl (pH 7.5) and 500 mM NaCl (buffer A). The supernatant was loaded onto HisTrap chelating column (GE Healthcare). The
column was extensively washed with buffer A, and the bound proteins were
eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 500 mM imidazole in buffer A. The
eluted sample was dialyzed against a buffer solution containing 20 mM
Tris·HCl (pH 7.5) and 100 mM NaCl (buffer B). TteCas3 was further isolated by
using a HiTrapQ anion exchange column (GE Healthcare) operated with
a linear gradient from 0 to 1 M NaCl in buffer B. Seleno-L-methionine
(SeMet)-substituted TteCas3 was prepared similarly as the native protein.
The purified protein was concentrated up to 6 mg/mL after a buffer change
to 20 mM Tris·HCl (pH 8.5) and 200 mM NaCl.
Crystallization, Data Collection, and Structure Determination. Crystallization
attempts of TteCas3 were performed at 22 °C by the sitting-drop vapordiffusion method. The initial crystals were obtained from the precipitant
solution containing 2 M NaCl, 0.1 M NaH2PO4, 0.1 M KH2PO4, and 0.1 M Mes
(pH 6.5). This condition was optimized by a grid search by using 24-well
Linbro plates and the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method at 22 °C where
1 μL of protein sample and 1 μL of precipitant were mixed together and
equilibrated with 0.2 mL of precipitant. Suitable crystals for diffraction
experiments were obtained from the precipitant containing 1.5 M NaCl,
0.07 M NaH2PO4, 0.07 M KH2PO4, and 0.1 M Bis-Tris (pH 5.5). For cocrystals
of TteCas3 and dATP, the protein was mixed with dATP at the molar ratio of
1–1.5. SeMet-substituted protein and dATP-complex crystals were obtained
under the same crystallization conditions. For diffraction experiments, crystals
were briefly immersed into the precipitant solution containing additional
50% (vol/vol) glycerol as the cryoprotectant and immediately placed in the
100 K nitrogen-gas stream. Using a SeMet-labeled TteCas3 crystal, singlewavelength anomalous dispersion data were collected at the wavelength

dataset for ATP complex was collected on the same beamline with the perframe oscillation of 1° and per-frame exposure of 3 s. In both cases, a total of
180 images were collected on the ADSC-Q270 CCD detector. The indexing,
integration, and scaling of the reflections were conducted by using HKL2000

(51), resulting in automatic modeling of ∼60% of the residues. Further model
building was performed manually by using WinCoot (52), and subsequent
refinement was performed with PHENIX (50). The data and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1.
