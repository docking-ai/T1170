During replication initiation, the core component of the helicase—
the Mcm2-7 hexamer—is loaded on origin DNA as a double hexamer (DH). The two ring-shaped hexamers are staggered, leading
to a kinked axial channel. How the origin DNA interacts with the
axial channel is not understood, but the interaction could provide
key insights into Mcm2-7 function and regulation. Here, we report
the cryo-EM structure of the Mcm2-7 DH on dsDNA and show that
the DNA is zigzagged inside the central channel. Several of the
Mcm subunit DNA-binding loops, such as the oligosaccharide–oligonucleotide loops, helix 2 insertion loops, and presensor 1 (PS1)
loops, are well defined, and many of them interact extensively
with the DNA. The PS1 loops of Mcm 3, 4, 6, and 7, but not
2 and 5, engage the lagging strand with an approximate step size
of one base per subunit. Staggered coupling of the two opposing
hexamers positions the DNA right in front of the two Mcm2–
Mcm5 gates, with each strand being pressed against one gate.
The architecture suggests that lagging-strand extrusion initiates
in the middle of the DH that is composed of the zinc finger domains of both hexamers. To convert the Mcm2-7 DH structure into
the Mcm2-7 hexamer structure found in the active helicase, the
N-tier ring of the Mcm2-7 hexamer in the DH-dsDNA needs to tilt
and shift laterally. We suggest that these N-tier ring movements
cause the DNA strand separation and lagging-strand extrusion.

of protein factors (3, 25). Initially DDK-dependent phosphorylation
of Mcm2-7 promotes the recruitment of Sld3 and Cdc45 (26–34)
before CDK-dependent phosphorylation of Sld2 and Sld3 (35, 36)
facilitates the binding of a preloading complex consisting of polymerase e, GINS, Sld2, and Dpb11 (37). MCM10 binding is required
to activate the CMG helicase for the production of ssDNA and
splitting of the Mcm2-7 double hexamer (38–42). The process of
helicase activation transforms the Mcm2-7 double hexamer that
encircles dsDNA into two Mcm2-7 hexamers that have ssDNA in
the central channel, but the mechanistic basis of this transition is not
known (3, 43–45). The active CMG helicase, comprised of Cdc45,
the GINS heterotetramer, and the Mcm2-7 hexamer, has coupled
ATPase- and DNA-unwinding activities (14, 46–49). Cryo-EM
structures of the S. cerevisiae and Drosophila CMG helicases
show that Cdc45 and GINS seal the N-tier ring at the Mcm2/5 interface, while the C-tier AAA+ containing the motor ring is relatively
flexible (22, 45, 50). Previous studies demonstrated that the CMG
helicase surrounds the leading strand and excludes the lagging strand
from the central channel (51, 52). This is consistent with a recent cryoEM structure of the yeast CMG bound to a forked DNA in which the
leading strand threads through the central Mcm2-7 channel (53).

| mini chromosome

During initiation of DNA replication in eukaryotes, the origin
recognition complex, with Cdc6 and Cdt1, assembles an inactive Mcm2-7 double hexamer on the dsDNA. Later, the
double hexamer recruits Cdc45 and GINS to form two active
and separate DNA helicases. The active Cdc45–Mcm2-7–GINS
helicase encircles the leading strand while excluding the lagging strand. One of the fundamental unanswered questions is
how each Mcm2-7 hexamer converts from binding dsDNA to
binding one of the single strands. The structure of the double
hexamer on dsDNA reveals how DNA interacts with key elements inside the central channel, leading us to propose a
lagging-strand extrusion mechanism. This work advances our
understanding of eukaryotic replication initiation.

T

he initiation of DNA replication in eukaryotes is tightly
regulated to ensure that duplication of DNA occurs only
once within a single cell-division cycle (1–5). In Saccharomyces
cerevisiae, the origin-recognition complex (ORC) is a stable sixsubunit complex that binds replication origins throughout the
cell-division cycle (6). After the M–G1 transition, Cdc6 binds to the
ORC and then recruits a Cdt1-bound Mcm2-7 hexamer, resulting
in Mcm2-7 loading onto DNA (7–15). Before loading, the Cdt1bound Mcm2-7 hexamer adopts a spiral shape with a gap at the
Mcm2/Mcm5 interface, which serves as the DNA entry gate for
helicase loading (10, 15–18). In contrast, the final product of the
multistep DNA loading process is an inactive head-to-head Mcm27 double hexamer encircling dsDNA. The double hexamer is
characterized by a central channel, which is wide enough to allow
dsDNA sliding in the presence of high salt in vitro (19, 20) or in a
transcription-dependent manner in vivo (21). Loading the first
Mcm2-7 hexamer involves an extensive interaction between the
winged helix domains (WHDs) in ORC–Cdc6 and in Mcm2-7 (14,
22, 23). Different mechanisms have been proposed for the loading
of the second MCM2-7 hexamer: (i) two face-to-face hexamers are
formed by two ORC–Cdc6 ATPases at replication origins (24), or
(ii) the first ORC–Mcm2-7 can directly recruit a second Cdc6 and
another Cdt1-bound Mcm2-7 to form the double hexamer (3).
At the beginning of S phase, the inactive double hexamer is converted into two active Cdc45–Mcm2-7–GINS (Go, Ichi, Nii, San)
(CMG) helicases by the actions of Cdc7-Dbf4–dependent protein
kinase (DDK), cyclin-dependent protein kinase (CDK), and an array

passing through the central channel is segmented and showed in orange.

These studies suggested that the parental dsDNA enters the helicase
from the N-tier ring, indicating that the C-tier motor ring pushes from
behind the N-tier ring, and hence the N-tier ring faces the fork
junction and is engaged in strand separation (54); however, alternative
models have been proposed in which the C-terminal domain of the
helicase contacts the parental dsDNA (50, 55–58).
The cryo-EM structure of the double hexamer in the absence of
DNA revealed that the two hexamers are interlocked at the N-tier
zinc finger (ZnF) domain regions and that the central channel is
twisted due to the staggered fitting of the two hexamers (59). The
double-stranded origin DNA passes through the central channel (19,
20). Multiple models have been proposed for the initial DNA strandseparation process that yields ssDNA templates for DNA synthesis
(60). Since in the CMG the N-tier moves ahead of the C-tier motor
ring (53, 54), one possibility is that, during activation, the two headto-head hexamers of the double hexamer could provide torsional
strain and push one strand of the DNA outside the double-hexamer
central channel, essentially extruding the lagging strand from either
the central N-tier (59, 61, 62) or the outer C-tier rings (53). A key
missing piece of information that would help resolve how origin
DNA is melted inside the double-hexamer chamber is the structure
of the double hexamer bound to the dsDNA origin. We describe
the cryo-EM structure of the S. cerevisiae double hexamer on
dsDNA. The structure shows that the DNA is pressed against the
Mcm2–Mcm5 gate at the N-terminal ZnF region and suggests that
strand extrusion commences at the middle of the double hexamer.

double-hexamer formation has been reconstituted in vitro using
DNA containing a single budding yeast replication origin ARS1 and
purified proteins (Fig. 1A) (19, 20). However, upon releasing the
double hexamer from DNA coupled magnetic beads with DNase I,
E9530 | www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1712537114

the DNA is lost from the double hexamer since the complex is able
to diffuse on dsDNA over a short distance in the absence of ATP
hydrolysis, resulting in the DNA being removed from the central
channel, consistent with in vitro MCM double-hexamer sliding
assays (20, 62, 63). Consequently, dsDNA is also absent from the
double hexamer purified from an endogenous source (59). Moreover, the standard prereplicative complex (pre-RC) assay yields
only small amounts of double hexamer, insufficient for cryo-EM.
To overcome these limitations, we engineered a multiorigin DNA
that allows the assembly of multiple double hexamers onto a single
piece of DNA. Optimized pre-RC assay conditions allow efficient
assembly of double hexamers at multiple replication origins with
increased yields. Each origin is separated by AluI restriction sites,
allowing restriction enzyme-mediated release of the double hexamer from the magnetic beads and the generation of ∼248-bp
DNA fragments. Optimal AluI digestion conditions allow rapid digestion, minimizing the chance that the double hexamer can slide off
from the DNA. In the raw electron micrograph recorded in a 300kV Titan Krios microscope using a K2 Summit direct electron detector of the AluI-treated sample embedded in vitreous ice, a long
stretch of DNA visibly protruded from many double-hexamer particles (Fig. 1B and SI Appendix, Fig. S1). 2D class averages confirmed
the presence of DNA in virtually all double-hexamer particles
(Fig. 1C). We reconstructed a 3D cryo-EM map at a resolution of
3.9 Å using RELION 2 software (Fig. 1D and SI Appendix, Figs. S2–
S4) (64). The dsDNA density is continuous, running all the way
through the axial channel of the double hexamer. We observe strong
density for the nucleotide bases and weaker density for some of the
backbone phosphate groups (Fig. 1D). The DNA density tapers off
at the two ends of the DNA, indicating that the DNA is less ordered
as it exits the C-tier rings of the double hexamer.
The Double Hexamer Binds to a 60-bp-Long and Zigzagged dsDNA.

We built an atomic model into the cryo-EM map of the doublehexamer–dsDNA using the available apo–double-hexamer structure as the initial model (Fig. 2 and Movie S1) (59). As observed
before, one hexamer in the double-hexamer–dsDNA structure is
tilted off axis by ∼14° with respect to the other hexamer, and the
two hexamers are laterally offset by ∼20 Å. Because the major and
minor grooves and many individual nucleotide groups (bases, riboses, or phosphates) are clearly resolved in the 3D density map,
we were able to model 60 bp into the continuous DNA density.

The offset arrangement of the double hexamer is a result of
differential interactions around the hexamer–hexamer interface (Figs. 2A and 3 A–C): Most hexamer–hexamer interactions are between the Mcm3:Mcm5:Mcm7 half rings of both
hexamers, which bury an interface of 11,848 Å2. The two
Mcm3:Mcm5:Mcm7 half rings lie on one side of the dsDNA.
The other two half rings comprised of Mcm2:Mcm4:Mcm6 are
separated from each other by a sizable gap and have only a few
interactions that bury a small surface of 670 Å2. This feature is
notable, because Mcm2, Mcm4, and Mcm6, but not Mcm3,
Mcm5, and Mcm7, have an extra N-terminal serine/threonine-rich

domain (NSD) that inhibits premature replication initiation (26,
27, 32, 66–69). The NSDs of Mcm2, Mcm4, and Mcm6 are not
resolved in the cryo-EM structure and thus are disordered.
However, their physical presence likely accounts for the apparent
gap and the off-axis tilt between the two hexamers in the region.
Therefore, the tilted arrangement of the double hexamer may
expose the NSDs of Mcm2, Mcm4, and Mcm6 to access by DDK
kinase to promote the eventual separation of the two hexamers.
The interaction between the two Mcm3:Mcm5:Mcm7 half rings
involves many important motifs: the N-terminal extension (NTE)
of Mcm5 and the N-terminal insertion (NTI) of Mcm7 observed
previously in the apo–double hexamer structure (59) and a previously unknown α-helix inserted into ZnF domain of Mcm5 which
we have called the “Zn-finger insertion” (ZFI) motif (Fig. 3D).
This motif is present only in Mcm5, not in any other yeast Mcm
subunits, and is absent in Mcm5 proteins of higher eukaryotes (SI
Appendix, Fig. S5). Computational analysis of the amino acid sequence suggests it is an unstructured loop. Therefore, the observed
helical structure of ZFI was unexpected and may be induced upon
double-hexamer assembly and be stabilized by interaction with
dsDNA since the insertion is disordered in the apo–double hexamer
structure as well as in the ORC–Cdc6–Cdt1–Mcm2-7 (OCCM) and
CMG structures (22, 59, 65). Indeed, Mcm5 lysine residue 233 in
the ZFI points toward the DNA. The Mcm5 ZFI helix interacts
extensively with Mcm3 and Mcm7 of the opposing hexamer, indicating a key role in double-hexamer assembly and possibly separation (see below). The Mcm5 ZFI is also structurally connected to
the Mcm5 α-helix bundle that harbors the Mcm5 P83L mutation
that eliminates the requirement for DDK activity during the initiation of DNA replication (70).

preparation, the DNA sequence information is averaged out.
Therefore, the nucleobase densities do not contain sequence identities. We modeled a random DNA sequence without using the
same sequence in the two symmetry-related Mcm2-7 hexamers
because origin DNAs are not palindromic. Overall, the DNA has a
zigzag shape due to the presence of two ∼15° turns (Fig. 2). These
DNA turns are a result of the off-axis tilt described above and the
lateral offset of the two hexamers. The inflection points are inside
the N-tier rings of the hexamers between the ZnF domains and the
oligosaccharide–oligonucleotide (OB) domains. In the doublehexamer–DNA structure, the five WHDs from Mcm3, 4, 5, 6, and
7 were not resolved, similar to the apo structure suggesting these
do not play a major role in DNA binding. In contrast, WHDs were
found to play a prominent role in recruitment of the Mcm27 hexamer by ORC–Cdc6 (65). The double-hexamer diameter is
∼3% larger than the apo structure, allowing accommodation of the
dsDNA in the axial channel (Movie S2).

Four of the Six Nucleotide Sites Are Occupied by ADP. Among the six
available ATP sites in each Mcm2-7 hexamer, only four were
occupied: at the interface between Mcm2:Mcm6, Mcm5:Mcm2,
Mcm3:Mcm5, and Mcm7:Mcm3, respectively (SI Appendix, Fig.
S6). The densities best fit with the ADP structure, indicating that
ATP may have hydrolyzed during the preceding Mcm2-7 hexamer recruitment and double-hexamer assembly processes. In-

deed, Mcm2-7 ATPase activity is required for double-hexamer
assembly (14, 49). The nucleotide pockets between Mcm4:
Mcm6 and between Mcm7:Mcm4 are empty. Such nucleotide
occupancy in double-hexamer–dsDNA contrasts with the apo–
double hexamer in which all six sites are occupied. It is possible
that the loss of dsDNA in the apo structure may have allowed the
empty sites at Mcm4:Mcm6 and Mcm7:Mcm4 interfaces to open

The Mcm2-7 Presensor 1 Loops Spiral Around the DNA. We further
analyzed how DNA interacts with the double hexamer and observed that the DNA was surrounded by and in direct contact
with many structural elements in the axial channel, such as the
ZnF domains, the channel-lining upper OB loops, the helix-2
insertion (H2I) loop, and the presensor 1 (PS1) loops (Fig. 4 and
SI Appendix, Figs. S7 and S8) (45). These interactions could
explain why the observed DNA sliding of the double hexamer in
vitro is rather slow and why it is dependent on high-salt conditions, as the ions are probably necessary to destabilize the nucleic
acid–protein contacts (19, 20).
The two hexamers bound DNA in the same manner, with each
hexamer covering approximately two full turns of dsDNA. This
was possible only because the double-hexamer interface region
covers exactly one full turn of the DNA, positioning each hexamer in the same, albeit opposing, orientation with respect to the
bound dsDNA (Figs. 2 and 4). Importantly, among the 12 ZnF
domains of the two hexamers, only six are close to the dsDNA:
the two pairs of ZnF domains of Mcm2 and Mcm5 (with its ZFI
helix) contact the dsDNA directly, with the two Mcm6 ZnF
domains nearby but not in contact with the DNA (Fig. 4 B–D and
SI Appendix, Fig. S7). Thus, one purpose of the staggered coupling of the two hexamers may be to position the dsDNA in the
middle section next to the Mcm2–Mcm5 gates of both hexamers,
a point that is discussed further below. Indeed, with the interface
of Mcm2–Mcm5 serving as the DNA entry gate during helicase
loading (10, 16, 17, 65), the proximity of the Mcm2 and Mcm5
ZnFs to the interface DNA suggests that initial DNA unwinding
occurs here (see below).
There are two known DNA-binding loops in the C-tier AAA+
motor domain of each Mcm subunit, the H2I and PS1 loops.
Inside each hexamer channel, the upper OB loop of Mcm4 inserts into the minor DNA groove, apparently responsible for
DNA bending at each inflection point at the ends of the 14 base
pairs of DNA that is surrounded by the double-hexamer interface (Fig. 4 A, C, and E). Notably, the same Mcm4 loop is at
the DNA fork junction that splits the double strand in the cryoEM structure of the CMG–forked DNA complex (53). Other
upper OB loops make contact with either the phosphate backbone or DNA grooves, or both, but they generally do not follow a
strict helical path (Fig. 4 C and E). However, five of the six
PS1 loops (in Mcm5, Mcm3, Mcm7, Mcm4, and Mcm6) approximately follow a right-handed helical path, with each subunit
rising approximately one base (Fig. 4 C, F, and G). The PS1 loop
of Mcm2 does not follow the helical path, as it does not interact
with DNA. Instead, the loop is localized between the lowestpositioned Mcm5 PS1 and the highest-position Mcm6 PS1. The
six H2I loops also make contact with DNA, but these loops do
not follow a helical path. Compared with the apo–double hexamer, these loops in the double-hexamer–dsDNA all move
slightly outwards to enlarge the central channel to accommodate
the dsDNA; however, the H2I loop of Mcm2 moved a significant
distance of ∼6 Å (SI Appendix, Fig. S9 and Movie S3). Interestingly, we found that a section of one α-helix of the AAA+
fold, just below the PS1 loop, is close to and interacts with the

dsDNA (SI Appendix, Fig. S10). The significance of the helix–DNA
contact awaits further study.
The Positions of the DNA-Binding H2I and PS1 Loops Vary to a
Different Degree in Different Mcm2-7–Containing Structures. The

S. cerevisiae Mcm2-7 hexamer structure bound to DNA has been
determined at least three times: in the current structure of
double-hexamer–dsDNA, in the Mcm2-7 loading intermediate
OCCM (65), and in the active CMG helicase bound to a forked
DNA (53). We extracted the individual Mcm proteins from the
three cryo-EM structures and superimposed them according to
their respective AAA+ domains (Fig. 5). Such alignments reveal
possible locations of the DNA-binding loops, but they may not
reflect actual loop movements during DNA translocation. In
general, the H2I loops were observed in very different positions,
being 4 Å to 15 Å apart in the three structures. However, the
PS1 loops are localized in a narrow range of 3–5 Å. Studies on an
archaeal MCM hexamer suggested that the H2I loop functions to
reduce the helicase affinity for DNA, as its deletion increases the
affinity by nearly 100-fold (71). Therefore, the H2I loop could
facilitate unwinding by destabilizing helicase–DNA interactions
but may not directly drive DNA translocation. Indeed, this loop
is present only in superfamily 6 MCM helicases and is absent in
all five of the other super families of helicases, consistent with
the idea that it does not participate in the direct unwinding
process (45, 72, 73). Interestingly, loops that are involved in
active DNA unwinding are usually associated with movements in
a narrow range, as observed with the bovine papillomavirus
E1 helicase (74, 75). The observation that H2I loops can adopt
very different conformations supports the idea that this loop may
not play an active role in DNA translocation. However, the 3- to
4-Å range of PS1 loop locations in the three different structures,
together with the above-mentioned observation that five
PS1 loops are arranged in a right-handed helical manner that
rises by one base per subunit, is consistent with an active role in
DNA translocation. The PS1 loop is conserved among the
AAA+ family of hexameric replicative helicases (45, 62, 76).
Mutations in PS1 loops of Mcm3, Mcm4, and Mcm5 are lethal or
cause growth defects in vivo and decrease DNA unwinding activity in vitro (77–79). The facts that PS1 loops are arranged in
spiral in the double hexamer and that their positions vary when
the AAA+ domains are aligned suggest that the loops move
during DNA translocation in Mcm2-7, as found in the virus DNA
helicase (45). However, eukaryotic helicases differ fundamentally from the homo-hexameric viral helicases in that they have
two additional factors, Cdc45 and GINS. The mechanism of
DNA translocation by the eukaryotic replicative helicase needs
further investigation (16, 22, 50, 53).
Lagging-Strand Extrusion May Initiate from the N-Tier Regions of
Mcm2-7 Double Hexamer. It is widely accepted that the interface

between Mcm2 and Mcm5 is the site where the dsDNA passes
through during the Mcm2-7 hexamer loading and may also be the
site where the ssDNA is extruded during helicase activation.
However, how and from which part of the Mcm2–Mcm5 interface
the lagging strand is extruded is not understood. In the doublehexamer–dsDNA structure, the two hexamers are staggered such
that the dsDNA is pressed directly against Mcm2 and Mcm5 at the
N-tier regions of both hexamers, with each strand facing one potential gate upon reopening, apparently poised for extrusion (Fig. 6
A–C and SI Appendix, Fig. S7). These two Mcm2–5 gates sit on
opposite sides of the DNA double helix, with opposite DNA
strands in the 5′–3′ orientation facing each gate (Fig. 6 A and B).
This architecture is consistent with the knowledge that the strand
to be extruded from the hexamer will become the lagging strand
for that particular Mcm2-7 hexamer (Fig. 6C). Because of the
topological constraint, the DNA segment must be pushed or pulled
to be perpendicular to the axial channel during extrusion. This

up, leading to the binding of the nucleotides at the two sites, as
the purification buffer used in that work contained 3 mM ATP
(59). Consistent with this possibility, the nucleotide at the Mcm3:
Mcm7 interface in the apo–double hexamer structure was noted
to be an ATP rather than an ADP. Interestingly, in the active
CMG helicase bound to either a ssDNA or a forked DNA, the
three sites that are filled with nucleotides, Mcm5:Mcm3, Mcm2:
Mcm5, and Mcm6:Mcm2, are the same as in the double hexamer–dsDNA, with the exception of Mcm3:Mcm7, which is
empty in the CMG but is occupied in the double hexamer–
dsDNA structure (53).

structural feature suggests that the initial strand separation and
extrusion occur in this region between the two Mcm4 upper OB
folds (Fig. 4A), the same region that contains the two Mcm4
NSDs that are the target for DDK regulation of initiation of
DNA replication (26, 27). The proposed N-tier-first extrusion is
supported by a previous crystallographic study of an archaeal
MCM hexamer in which ssDNA was found to bind the N-tier
upper OB loops perpendicular to the channel axis (80). Corresponding OB loops of Mcm2 and Mcm5 were shown by
mutagenesis to be important for initiation in S. cerevisiae (79,
80). Mcm10 is a key replication factor that interacts with
ssDNA, and it is essential during helicase activation to allow
the CMG complex to gain processive DNA unwinding activity
(38–40, 81, 82). It was recently shown that Mcm10 binds to
an N-tier region of Mcm2 (the Mcm10-binding motif of
Mcm2, referred to as “mbm”) to facilitate the replication
initiation (83). The interaction between Mcm10 and the
N-tier of Mcm2 is consistent with our proposed N-tier-first
extrusion model.
Remarkably, the four PS1 loops of Mcm3, Mcm7, Mcm4, and
Mcm6 of the double hexamer interact directly with the future
lagging-strand DNA but not with the future leading-strand DNA
(Fig. 6D). This feature is consistent with the concept that the
lagging strand is extruded by the double hexamer during
helicase activation. In the active CMG helicase, there are also
four PS1 loops that engage the DNA (Fig. 6E). However, the
E9534 | www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1712537114

PS1 loops interact with the leading-strand DNA, as the lagging
strand is excluded from the central channel (53, 84). Further,
different PS1 loops interact with DNA: in the double hexamer,
the PS1 loops of Mcm2 and Mcm5 do not interact with DNA,
but in CMG, the PS1 loops of Mcm2 and Mcm5, along with
Mcm3 and Mcm6, engage with DNA, and instead the PS1 loops
of Mcm4 and Mcm7 do not contact DNA. Thus, the initiation
of DNA replication must lead to a reorganization of the
PS1 loops from the helicase-activation mode (Mcm 3/4/6/7
PS1 loops interacting with the lagging strand) to a DNAunwinding mode (Mcm2/3/5/6 PS1 loops interacting with leading strand).

structures on DNA (i) as an intermediate preceding the double
hexamer (the OCCM) and (ii) as a form following the doublehexamer activation (the CMG helicase) are both available (53,
65), providing an opportunity to analyze the conformational
changes required for double-hexamer activation. We superimposed the Mcm2-7 hexamer of the OCCM with one hexamer
of the double hexamer by aligning their respective C-tier motor
ring. Such alignment reveals potential movement and conformational changes in the N-tier rings, because it is the untangling and dissociation of these rings that underlies doublehexamer assembly and subsequent disassembly, respectively.
We found the two N-tier rings are rotated by nearly 30° during

double-hexamer assembly (Fig. 7A). Because ATP hydrolysis by
the Mcm2-7 subunits is required for double-hexamer loading (14,
49), it is possible that the N-tier ring rotation stores the energy
derived from ATP hydrolysis during double-hexamer assembly for
its subsequent disassembly during helicase activation (18, 85).
Importantly, the 30° rotation apparently ensures that the DNA
faces the Mcm2–Mcm5 gate at the N-tier region. We further
compared the Mcm2-7 structure of the double-hexamer–dsDNA
with that of CMG–fork DNA by aligning their respective C-tier
rings and found that the N-tier ring translates laterally by ∼12 Å
and tilts by ∼12° (Fig. 7B and Movie S4). These movements may
underlie the DNA strand separation during the double-hexamer
activation, as described below.
A Plausible Lagging-Strand Extrusion Model. Based on the abovedescribed features observed in the double-hexamer–dsDNA
structure, we propose the following lagging-strand extrusion and
helicase-activation model (Fig. 7C): First, the double hexamer
may be in a strained state, storing energy derived from the ATP
hydrolysis–powered Mcm2-7 hexamer loading and dimerization
process. We note that the Mcm2-7 motor is inactive in this state
(Fig. 7 A and C, step I) (63). During helicase activation, several
protein factors, such as Sld3/7, Sld2, DDK, Dpb11, and Mcm10,
and the helicase accessory components GINS and Cdc45 may
interact with the N-tier rings, triggering the release of stored
energy to drive Mcm2-7 movement and conformational changes
(the observed N-tier ring tilt and lateral shift). Because the
translocating PS1 loops are engaged with the lagging strand, a
3′–5′ translocation of the coupled (hence stationary) double

hexamer would pump the lagging strand toward the inside (Fig.
7B). We also propose that the accumulation of the lagging strand
inside the channel accompanied by the shift and tilt of the N-tier
ring may separate the DNA double strand and extrude the lagging strand from the axial channel via the Mcm2–Mcm5 gate
starting at the N-tier region (Fig. 7C, step II). This structural
rearrangement would also lead to the activation of the Mcm2-7
ATPase motor, allowing the two helicases to move on leading
strands past each other in 3′–5′ direction (Fig. 7C, step III) and
go on to advance the replication forks using a strand-exclusion
mechanism (Fig. 7C, step IV) (53).
DDK is required to activate the intertwined double hexamer.
The DDK-docking site on each Mcm4 subunit on one hexamer
(residues 174–333) sits immediately adjacent to the Mcm5-Mcm2
N-terminal domains on the opposite hexamer (26). Next to the
DDK-docking domain is an unstructured region of Mcm4 that
contains a domain (residues 74–174) that prevents premature
initiation of DNA replication. When this domain is deleted, DDK
is no longer required for cell viability and initiation of DNA
replication (27). Likewise, a mutation in the N terminus of Mcm5
(P83L) that also eliminates the requirement for DDK is located in
a region of the N terminus of Mcm5 that interacts with Mcm7 and
Mcm3, and the mutation could alter the structure of the hexamer–
hexamer interface, particularly near the Mcm5 ZnF with its ZFI
helix (70). We suggest that DDK phosphorylation of Mcm4 inactivates the Mcm4-inhibitory domain, and this may be the major
factor that triggers the ensuing series of conformational changes
that lead to the separation of the two N-tier rings and the dissociation of two hexamers (27, 32). Furthermore, because the

Fig. 7. Conformational changes of the N-tier rings of
Mcm2-7 hexamers during double-hexamer conversion
to the CMG helicase may underlie the lagging-strand
separation and extrusion mechanism. (A) The Mcm2-7
hexamers found in the OCCM (gray) and in the
double hexamer (colored) are aligned based on all
atoms in their respective C-tier rings. Note the ∼30°
clockwise rotation of the N-tier ring during doublehexamer formation, which is an energy-consuming
process (requiring ATP hydrolysis). Therefore, the
double hexamer may be in a strained high-energy
configuration. (B) The Mcm2-7 hexamers found in
the double hexamer and in the CMG helicase, aligned
based on all atoms of their respective C-tier rings. Note
a ∼12° tilt and a ∼12-Å lateral translation of the N-tier
ring. These movements may be driven by releasing
the stored energy in the double hexamer. In both
A and B, leading- and lagging-strand DNA in the
double-hexamer–dsDNA structure are shown in blue
and magenta, respectively. (C) A lagging-strand DNA
extrusion model. Step I: The double hexamer may be
in a strained high-energy state, as the two hexamers
are offset, and the dsDNA is zig-zagged inside the
central channel. The activation factors, such as DDK,
Sld2, Sld3, Sld7, Mcm10, and Dpb11, may trigger conformational changes in the double hexamer, leading
to the release of the stored energy to pump the lagging strands toward the inside. The two vertical red
arrows indicate the direction of lagging-strand movement. Step II: The released energy may also drive the
observed tilt and lateral shift of the N-tier rings. These
N-tier ring movements may extrude the accumulating
lagging strands through the Mcm2–Mcm5 gates at the
N-tier regions of the double hexamer. The two horizontal red arrows indicate the N-tier ring shift and
slight tilt. Step III: The two active helicases on the leading
strand move past each other in the 3′–5′ direction with
their respective N-tier rings ahead of the C-tier motor
rings. Step IV: Bidirectional fork advancement by the
two CMG helicases. The blue arrows indicate the helicase movement directions.

dsDNA–double hexamer appears to have ADP bound at four of
the Mcm2-7 subunit–subunit interfaces and is in an ATPaseinactive state (63), the conformational changes in the Mcm2-7
during helicase activation may also provide a mechanism for
ATP rejuvenation as well as ATPase activation.
There is a caveat to the proposed strand-extrusion model. The
double-hexamer separation and helicase activation are likely
multistep processes that eventually lead to CMG formation.
Therefore, the observed tilt and lateral shift of the N-tier ring
required for the double hexamer-to-CMG conversion may be a
net effect of several steps and may not necessarily be solely responsible for the separation and extrusion of the DNA strand.
An alternative strand-separation model would be to pump the
DNA toward the inside. As the DNA accumulates at the middle
N-tier region, it buckles and eventually is forced out at the
middle of the double hexamer. Such a pumping-DNA-inwards
model was previously proposed for origin melting in archaeal
MCM (80) as well as for the large T antigen (86). However, the
established 3′–5′ DNA translocation direction of the CMG
helicase dictates that DNA should be pulled outwards rather
than pushed inwards (87). It is unclear if the C-tier motor ring is
able to operate in reverse to pump the DNA inwards. In yet
another model, Mcm10 plays a major role in origin melting by
binding to and stabilizing the melted and extruded lagging strand

(42). Determining the structures of the activation intermediates
of the double hexamer would be a key to clarify the important
question in chromosome replication.
Experimental Procedures
10× ARS1 DNA Magnetic Bead Preparation. To produce the 10× ARS1 DNA
fragment, a 5-kb PCR fragment was amplified using pCS735 [pUC57 carrying
a 10× cassette of ARS1 (248 bp), each flanked by AluI restriction sites], primer
1693 (GAAGATCAGTTGGGTGCACG), and primer 1568 (biotin-GCATCTTTTACTTTCACCAGCG). The resultant 5-kb DNA was bound to Dynabeads
MyOne Streptavidin T1 beads (Invitrogen). Subsequently, a HindIII fragment
containing the nonorigin DNA was released, resulting in ∼3 kb of 10× ARS1
DNA bound to the beads.
Double-Hexamer Preparation. In vitro loading of double hexamer on an ARS1containing linear DNA followed the standard protocol (20, 63) with the
following modifications. Here, AluI instead of DNase I was used to release
the double hexamer from the magnetic beads. Briefly, ORC (80 nM), Cdc6
(160 nM), Cdt1 (160 nM), and Mcm2-7 (160 nM) were incubated with the 10×
ARS1 DNA-coupled beads (15 nM) in buffer A1 (50 mM Hepes·KOH at pH 7.5,
10 mM MgAc, 0.1 mM ZnAc, 3 mM ATP, 5 mM DTT, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10%
glycerol, 0.05 mM EDTA) plus 300 mM KGlu and 0.8 mg/mL BSA for 60 min.
The beads were washed with buffer A1 plus 300 mM NaCl and 100 mM KGlu
before digestion with 2 U AluI (New England Biolabs) in buffer C (50 mM
Hepes·KOH at pH 7.5, 100 mM KAc, 5 mM MgAc) with the addition of 5%
buffer A1 plus 100 mM KGlu for 1 min at 24 °C.

Image Processing and 3D Reconstruction. We collected ∼3,000 raw movie
micrographs. The movie frames were first aligned and superimposed by the
program MotionCorr 2.0 (88). Contrast transfer function parameters of each
aligned micrograph were calculated using the program CTFFIND4 (89). All
the remaining steps, including particle auto selection, 2D classification, 3D
classification, 3D refinement, and density map postprocessing, were performed using RELION 2.0 (64). The template for automatic picking was
generated from a 2D average of about ∼10,000 manually picked particles in
different views. Automatic particle selection was performed for the entire
dataset, and 312,403 particles were initially picked. We then carefully
inspected the selected particles, removed “bad” ones that were broken or
aggregated particles, repicked some initially missed “good” ones with
expected size and shape, and sorted the remaining good particles by similarity to the 2D references; the bottom 10% of the particles with the lowest
z-scores were removed from the particle pool. 2D classification of all good
particles was performed and particles in the classes with features unrecognizable by visual inspection were removed. A total of 163,255 particles
was used for further 3D classification. We derived five 3D models from the
dataset and chose the two best models with strong DNA density for final
refinement; the other three models were distorted or had weak DNA density, and those particles were discarded. The final dataset having
58,772 particles was used for further 3D refinement with application of the
expected C2 symmetry, resulting in the 3.9-Å 3D density map. The resolution
of the map was estimated by the gold-standard Fourier shell correlation at a
correlation cutoff value of 0.143. The 3D density map was sharpened by
applying a negative B-factor of −168 Å2. We also refined the 3D map

Structural Modeling, Refinement, and Validation. The cryo-EM structure of the
yeast Mcm2–7 double hexamer [Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID code 3JA8] was
used as the initial model directly docking into the EM map. Each Mcm
protein was then split into two parts, an N-terminal domain and a C-terminal
domain, for subsequent rigid body-fitting into the 3D density map with
COOT and Chimera. The dsDNA was then manually built into the long
density that ran through the two Mcm2-7 hexameric structures in the program COOT. The DNA sequence used in preparation of the double hexamer
is an origin DNA (ARS1) that had been multimerized. However, when the
DNA is cut by the restriction enzyme to release the multimers of the double
hexamer on DNA, it is possible that the DNA is not registered the same way
relative to the origin in the double hexamers. For this reason we did not try
to register the DNA sequence. We modeled the dsDNA in a random sequence, and the twofold symmetry was not enforced either in the DNA
sequence during modeling or in refinement. The entire Mcm2–7 doublehexamer DNA model was first refined by rigid body refinement of individual chains in the PHENIX program and subsequently was adjusted manually
in COOT. Finally, the atomic model was validated using MolProbity. Structural figures were prepared in Chimera and PyMOL (https://pymol.org/2/).
The final model was cross-validated using a method described previously
(90). Briefly, we randomly added 0.1 Å noise to the coordinates of the final
model using the PDB tools in Phenix and then refined the noise-added
against the first half map (Half1) that was produced from one half of the
particle dataset during refinement by RELION. We performed one round of
coordinate refinement, followed by a B-factor refinement. The refined
model was then correlated with the 3D maps of the two half maps (Half1
and Half2) in Fourier space to produce two forward scatter (FSC) curves:
FSCwork (the model versus the Half1 map) and FSCfree (the model versus the
Half2 map), respectively. A third FSC curve was calculated between the refined model and the final 3.9-Å resolution density map produced from all
particles. The general agreement of these curves was taken as an indication
that the model was not overfitted.
The map coordinates for the Mcm2-7 double hexamer on DNA were
deposited as EMD-9400, PDB ID code 5BK4.

EM grid preparation, we checked the sample for homogeneity by negativestain EM. Then 3 μL of the double-hexamer DNA sample was applied to glowdischarged C-flat 1.2/1/3 holey carbon grids or lacey grids covered with a
layer of continuous carbon film, incubated for 10 s at 6 °C and 95% humidity, blotted for 3 s, and then plunged into liquid ethane using an FEI
Vitrobot IV. In C-flat R1.2/1.3 holey carbon film grids, the particles bound to
holey carbon film or aggregated in the hole, even at high protein concentrations. In lacey grids with continuing carbon film, the double-hexamer
particles distributed well with no aggregation problem. We loaded the
grids into an FEI Titan Krios electron microscope operated at a high tension
of 300 kV and collected images semiautomatically with EPU (FEI) under lowdose mode at a nominal magnification of 130,000× and a pixel size of 1.09 Å
per pixel. A Gatan K2 Summit direct electron detector was used in super resolution mode for image recording with an under-focus range from 1.5–2.5 μm.
A BioQuantum energy filter (Gatan) installed in front of the K2 detector was
operated in zero-energy-loss mode with an energy slit width of 20 eV. The dose
rate was 10 electrons·Å−2·s−1, and the total exposure time was 6 s. The total
dose was divided into a 30-frame movie so each frame was exposed for 0.2 s.
