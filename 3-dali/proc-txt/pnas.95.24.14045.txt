that efficiently phosphorylate the antiviral drugs acyclovir or
ganciclovir but not AZT or AZT-MP (6, 7).
Therefore, we set out to understand the structural basis for
the slow activation of AZT-MP. The structures of the yeast
TmpK (TmpKyeast) complexed with either the physiological
substrate dTMP or the partially activated prodrug AZT-MP
indicate that it is the interaction of the 39-deoxyribose substituent with a carboxylic acid side chain located in the P loop
sequence that is responsible for the reduced rate with
AZT-MP (8, 9). This interaction causes a P loop movement to
accommodate the bulky and rigid azido group of AZT-MP.
The residue after this carboxylic acid is Arg-15 and it was
shown to play a catalytic role (10). Thus, we postulated that it
is the resulting arginine displacement that is responsible for the
reduced phosphorylation rate. Our interest in TmpK from
Escherichia coli (TmpKcoli) arose when we realized that it lacks
this catalytic arginine in the P loop (having a glycine instead)
although the P loop carboxylic acid is retained, albeit as
glutamic acid in contrast to the aspartic acid in the yeast
enzyme. This led to the hypothesis that even if a similar P loop
shift were to occur upon AZT-MP binding to TmpKcoli, it
should not have such a drastic effect on catalysis (10). Kinetic
measurements support our hypothesis, showing that the rate of
AZT-MP phosphorylation at saturating substrate concentrations is reduced by only a factor of 2 in comparison to dTMP,
whereas this factor is 200 for the TmpKyeast (10). The crystal
structures of TmpKcoli complexed with P1-(59-adenosyl)-P5(59-thymidyl)pentaphosphate (TP5A) or P1-(59-adenosyl)-P5[59-(39-azido-39-deoxythymidine)] pentaphosphate (AZTP5A) reported herein provide a structural explanation for our
kinetic observations and supply important insights as to how
TmpKs achieve catalysis. In addition, this is a structure of what
we term a type II TmpK, which differs from type I TmpKs (e.g.,
yeast and human TmpKs) in their P loop and Lid sequences.

ABSTRACT
The crystal structures of Escherichia coli
thymidylate kinase (TmpK) in complex with P1-(5*-adenosyl)P5-(5*-thymidyl)pentaphosphate and P1-(5*-adenosyl)P5-[5*(3*-azido-3*-deoxythymidine)] pentaphosphate have been
solved to 2.0-Å and 2.2-Å resolution, respectively. The overall
structure of the bacterial TmpK is very similar to that of yeast
TmpK. In contrast to the human and yeast TmpKs, which
phosphorylate 3*-azido-3*-deoxythymidine 5*-monophosphate
(AZT-MP) at a 200-fold reduced turnover number (kcat) in
comparison to the physiological substrate dTMP, reduction of
kcat is only 2-fold for the bacterial enzyme. The different
kinetic properties toward AZT-MP between the eukaryotic
TmpKs and E. coli TmpK can be rationalized by the different
ways in which these enzymes stabilize the presumed transition
state and the different manner in which a carboxylic acid side
chain in the P loop interacts with the deoxyribose of the
monophosphate. Yeast TmpK interacts with the 3*-hydroxyl of
dTMP through Asp-14 of the P loop in a bidentate manner:
binding of AZT-MP results in a shift of the P loop to
accommodate the larger substituent. In E. coli TmpK, the
corresponding residue is Glu-12, and it interacts in a side-on
fashion with the 3*-hydroxyl of dTMP. This different mode of
interaction between the P loop carboxylic acid with the 3*
substituent of the monophosphate deoxyribose allows the
accommodation of an azido group in the case of the E. coli
enzyme without significant P loop movement. In addition,
although the yeast enzyme uses Arg-15 (a glycine in E. coli) to
stabilize the transition state, E. coli seems to use Arg-153 from
a region termed Lid instead. Thus, the binding of AZT-MP to
the yeast TmpK results in the shift of a catalytic residue, which
is not the case for the bacterial kinase.
Phosphorylation of AZT-MP by thymidylate kinase (TmpK;
EC 2.7.4.9, ATP:dTMP phosphotransferase) has been implicated as the rate-limiting step in the activation pathway of the
anti-HIV prodrug 39-azido-39-deoxythymidine (AZT). AZT
must be phosphorylated by cellular enzymes to azidothymidine
triphosphate before it can exert its antiviral effect by inhibiting
HIV reverse transcriptase and acting as a chain terminator of
nascent DNA strands. The bottleneck of AZT activation lies
in the second phosphorylation step, the step that adds a
phosphate group to azidothymidine monophosphate (AZTMP) to yield azidothymidine diphosphate and is catalyzed by
TmpK. Cells treated with AZT accumulate the toxic AZT-MP
(1–3) in millimolar concentration (4, 5), and thus the active
AZT triphosphorylated metabolite is at very low concentration. This situation is only slightly improved upon coinfection
with herpes simplex virus I thymidine kinase-carrying vectors

diphenyl phosphorochloridate) as described (11) for the synthesis of AP5A.
The fluorescent TP5A analog TP5A-MANT [the fluorescent
N-methylanthraniloyl (MANT) group is on the ribose of the
adenosine moiety] was prepared as described (12) for the
preparation of MANT-AP5A. Fluorescence measurements
were performed with a SLM 8100 spectrofluorimeter as
described (12) with an excitation wavelength of 360 nm and an
emission wavelength of 440 nm. The experiments were carried
out at 25°C in a buffer containing 100 mM TriszHCl (pH 7.5),
5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM EDTA, and 100 mM KCl.
Protein Preparation and Crystallographic Analysis. E. coli
TmpK was cloned from genomic DNA into a pJC20 vector,
expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3), and purified to homogeneity
as described (10). Crystals of the complex of E. coli TmpK with
either TP5A or AZT-P5A were grown by the vapor diffusion
method using the hanging drop geometry. An enzyme solution
(15 mgyml) was premixed with the nucleotide solution to
contain (final concentrations) enzyme (12 mgyml) and 2 mM
nucleotide. Typically, 4 ml of the enzymeynucleotide mixture
was mixed with 2 ml of a solution containing 1.25 M ammonium
phosphate (pH 8.0) and left to equilibrate at 20°C against a
reservoir of 2.5 M ammonium phosphate. Crystals with typical
dimensions of 500 3 400 3 100 mm grew after a few days in
space group R32. Molecular replacement with the yeast TmpK
model was not successful. For heavy-atom soaking trials, the
crystals were transferred to a solution of 1.6 M sodiumy
potassium tartrate and 100 mM TriszHCl (pH 8.0). This
resulted in a doubling of the c axis cell length and in a dimer
instead of a monomer in the asymmetric unit. Heavy-atom
screening was done by soaking the crystals overnight in a
tartrate solution containing 1 mM of the heavy atom being
analyzed before mounting in quartz capillaries. X-ray data
were collected at 4°C by using a Siemens Hi-Star area detector
mounted on a Mac Science rotating anode generator operated
at 45 kV and 100 mA. Data were processed with XDS (13) and
merged with XSCALE. Only crystals soaked with ethylmercury
phosphate were isomorphous with the native crystals, with two
mercury atoms bound per monomer. Refinement of heavyatom positions with MLPHARE (14) followed by phase improvement through 2-fold noncrystallographic symmetry averaging,
solvent flattening, and histogram matching with the program
DM (15), resulted in an easily interpretable electron-density
map. Model building was done with the program O (16). The
TmpKyeast model was moved as a rigid body into the density,
a procedure that required readjusting the relative positions of
the secondary structural elements. Rigid-body refinement
followed by simulated annealing and B group refinement to
2.4-Å resolution with X-PLOR (17) resulted in a model with
Rwork 5 24% and Rfree 5 29%. Further refinement including
bulk solvent correction and individual B factor refinement was
done with a data set collected at the Max-Planck beam line
BW6 (DESY) of a frozen crystal with a monomer in the
asymmetric unit. Crystals of TmpKcoli complexed with AZTP5A were grown under conditions similar to those used for
TP5A. X-ray data were measured from a single crystal at 4°C
by using a Siemens Hi-Star area detector, reduced with XDS
and merged with XSCALE. The complex with AZT-P5A is
isomorphous to that with TP5A, so the refinement was started
with the E. coli TmpK–TP5A model. Refinement statistics are
shown in Table 1.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Overall Structure. The crystal structures of E. coli TmpK
(213 amino acid residues) complexed with the bisubstrate
inhibitors TP5A or AZT-P5A were solved at 2.0-Å and 2.2-Å
resolution, respectively. In comparison to the previously determined yeast TmpK (29% amino acid identity), the bacterial
enzyme has a similar ayb fold that consists of nine a-helices

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 95 (1998)
that surround a five-stranded b-sheet core and is likewise a
homodimer. Overlaying the yeast TmpK model with the E. coli
TmpK model results in good overlap of the b-sheet core (rms
deviation for five strands, 27 Ca atoms, 0.36 Å) but the
surrounding helices have moved relative to each other (rms
deviation for nine helices, 113 Ca atoms, 2.88 Å). This explains
the failure of the molecular replacement attempt and the need
for the de novo structure determination.
NMP kinases and many other nucleotide binding proteins
contain a sequence motif (GX4GKSyT), called the P loop,
whose function is to bind nucleoside di- or triphosphates (18).
NMP kinases bind an additional nucleotide substrate, a NMP,
and catalyze the reversible phosphoryl transfer from the
triphosphate [preferably ATP for TmpKs (19)] to the monophosphate (dTMP). In all previously determined NMP kinase
structures, the monophosphate is bound in a deep cleft with
the nucleobase surrounded by protein residues. The triphosphate is bound (mainly by the P loop) with its phosphates
facing that of the monophosphate and is observed to interact
with a region called Lid. The closure of the Lid region upon
triphosphate binding acts in most NMP kinases to bring
catalytic arginines to the reaction center. TmpKyeast was the
first NMP kinase observed to deviate from this principle;
although there is a Lid region near the triphosphate, it lacks
positively charged catalytic residues. In contrast, TmpKcoli
does possess positively charged residues in its Lid region that
are observed to interact with ATP. On the basis of this
difference between TmpKcoli and TmpKyeast, we have categorized TmpKs in to two types. Type I TmpKs (e.g., yeast and
human) have a basic residue in their P loop sequence (in
addition to the invariant lysine) that can interact with the
g-phosphate of ATP and lack such residues in the Lid region.
The situation is reversed for type II TmpKs (e.g., E. coli), which
are thus more similar to other NMP kinases, such as adenylate
kinase or uridylate kinase, that have a glycine in the P loop and
basic residues in the Lid region that interact with ATP.
A unique feature of TmpKs of both types is that a residue
in the P loop (Asp-14 in TmpKyeast and Glu-12 in TmpKcoli)
interacts with the nucleotide monophosphate via hydrogen
bond(s) with the 39-hydroxyl of the deoxyribose. This interaction has far reaching implications for ribose modification.
Nucleotide Binding. The bisubstrate inhibitors TP5A and
AZT-P5A are bound tightly to the enzyme (Kd values of 20 nM
and 34 nM, respectively) in accordance with their relatively low
B factors. A distance map showing the interactions between
TP5A and TmpKcoli is shown in Fig. 1a. The complex was
crystallized at high phosphate concentration, which is not
compatible with the presence of free magnesium. Attempts to
soak in magnesium after crystal transfer to ammonium sulfate
or potassium tartrate solutions resulted in the loss of highresolution diffraction.
Many of the interactions between the nucleotide and
TmpKcoli are similar to those in TmpKyeast. For dTMP binding,
conserved interactions are the base-stacking interaction of the
thymidine base with a phenylalanine (Phe-74), a H-bond
between the O4 carbonyl and an arginine side chain (Arg-78),
and the use of a tyrosine residue (Tyr-108) to discriminate
against ribonucleotides. Although in the yeast enzyme the base
makes further interactions with tightly bound water molecules,
the E. coli enzyme uses the side chains of Thr-105 and Gln-109.
The most striking difference is the interaction of the 39hydroxyl with the P loop carboxylic acid (Fig. 1b): this is a
bidentate interaction in the yeast enzyme (Asp-14), but a
side-on interaction in the E. coli enzyme (Glu-12). The adenine base and phosphate interactions are also very similar in
the two TmpKs. The Lid region of TmpKcoli contains the highly
basic amino acid sequence 148KRARAR153 but only Arg-153
interacts with the phosphates. Arg-149 stacks against the
adenine base and Arg-151 points toward the solvent.

Unlike the TP5A–TmpKyeast complex (10), where the phosphates are observed in only one conformation, in the TP5A–
TmpKcoli complex, the middle phosphate is observed in two
conformations, and in the AZT–P5A-TmpKcoli complex, four
phosphates were modeled with alternate conformations. The
phenomenon of multiple conformations has also been observed in a complex of adenylate kinase and AP5A (20). This
may be a consequence of the interaction of the phosphates with
an arginine of the Lid region and a consequence of the absence
of magnesium, which would stabilize one conformation but not
the other.
The comparison between the TmpKcoli complex with TP5A
and that with AZT-P5A shows a nearly identical protein
structure (rms deviation of 0.23 Å on 208 Ca atoms). However,
three differences between the structures are significant. The
first is a rotation of the deoxyribose moiety of thymidine and
of three carboxylic acid side chains located in close proximity
to the 39 position. The rotation of the whole deoxyribose as a
rigid body around the C19 and C49 atoms can be attributed to

the azido group that would otherwise be too close to the side
chain of Glu-12 (Fig. 1d). Concomitantly, Glu-12 rotates in the
opposite direction to make space for the azido group. In
addition, the rigid body rotation of the deoxyribose forces
Glu-160 to adjust its position. The side chains of Glu-12 and
Asp-157 are only 2.6 Å apart in the TP5A complex structure
(3.1 Å in the AZT-P5A complex), suggesting that the pKa of
these acids is perturbed and that at least one of them is
protonated at physiological pH. The second difference between the structures is the conformation of the phosphates of
the bound TP5A and AZT-P5A, which could be attributed to
the rigid-body rotation of the deoxyribose forced upon by the
azido group. However, this did not change the positions of the
nucleobases. The third important difference between the
complexes is a slight change at the tip of the P loop, probably
caused by the different phosphate conformations, as it is the
P loop that interacts the most with the phosphates.

suggests that the arginine situated in the P loop sequence is
used to stabilize the transition state (in addition to other basic
residues). The P loop of E. coli has a glycine at this position.
Although the yeast enzyme has only one basic residue in the
Lid region that does not interact with the phosphate groups,
the bacterial enzyme has four basic residues in its Lid region
(Fig. 2). Therefore, we postulated that an arginine from the E.
coli Lid region fulfills a similar role to that of the arginine in
the P loop of the yeast enzyme (10). The structural overlay of
the yeast and E. coli TmpKs confirms our hypothesis. The tip
of Arg-15 (yeast), which interacts with the middle phosphate
of TP5A, is spatially very close to the tip of Arg-153 (E. coli),
which also interacts with the middle phosphate (Fig. 1c).
This observation may in part explain the kinetic differences
observed between the two TmpKs (i.e., TmpKyeast and
TmpKcoli) with respect to their AZT-MP phosphorylation
rates. For TmpKyeast , the binding of AZT-MP induces some
movement of the P loop via the interaction of the P loop
aspartic acid with the 39-azido group. This movement of the P
loop results in a reduced catalytic rate that can be attributed
to at least three factors. The P loop has the function of binding
the phosphoryl donor, in this case ATP, so any relative shift of
the positions of the two substrates could decrease the catalytic
rate. A further reason could be the movement of the P loop
arginine, which presumably fulfills a catalytic role. Lastly, the
shift of the aspartic acid (Asp-14 in yeast), an essential residue
for catalysis (unpublished results), could also account for the
reduced rate. It cannot be ruled out that it is a combination of
the above three reasons that leads to the reduction of catalytic
activity.
In contrast, on comparing the complexes of TmpKcoli with
TP5A and with AZT-P5A, no significant P loop movement is
seen. The small adjustment that is required for fitting the
bulkier azido group seems to be restricted to a slight rotation
of the whole 39-azido-deoxyribose moiety and the side chain of
the P loop glutamate. Because the interaction of the P-loop
carboxylic acid with the 39 group is side-on, unlike the bidentate interaction seen in TmpKyeast, the side chain can adjust
relatively easily to AZT-MP binding. In addition, because in
TmpKcoli a presumed catalytic arginine originates from the Lid
region, any P loop perturbation should not effect that residue.
These are the structural reasons why the rate of AZT-MP
phosphorylation is only 2-fold slower than that of dTMP.
Role of Arginines in Phosphoryl Transfer Reactions. The
use of arginines from the Lid region in TmpKcoli would be in
analogy to other NMP kinases such as adenylate kinase (21) or
uridylate kinase (22, 23) that use basic residues from the Lid
region for transition state stabilization. TmpKyeast lacks such
basic Lid residues and uses its P loop arginine instead. Thus,
two types of TmpKs have evolved; type I, which stabilize the
negative charge in the transition state by having the positively
charged guanidinium group originating from the P loop (i.e.,
yeast enzyme), and type II, where the guanidinium group
originates from the Lid region (E. coli enzyme).
A similar situation is encountered when comparing two
types of GTPases, the heterotrimeric G proteins and GTPases
belonging to the Ras superfamily. In the former, a catalytically
essential arginine is present in the Ga subunits. These subunits
are made up of two domains—one is the Ras-like GTP-binding
domain and the other is an a-helical domain. An arginine
residue positioned by the a-helical domain (residue 178 in Gia)

FIG. 2. Structure-based sequence alignment of the P loop and Lid
regions. Lysine and arginine residues that make phosphate interactions
are underlined doubly and those that make a stacking interaction with
the adenine base are underlined singly. TmpKs are unique in having
a carboxylic acid situated at the tip of the P loop (Glu-12 in TmpKcoli).
In type I TmpKs (e.g., human and yeast), the following residue is an
arginine that has been shown to be catalytically important for the yeast
enzyme. Type II TmpKs (e.g., E. coli) lack this arginine, having instead
a number of basic residues in their Lid region: for TmpKcoli, Arg-153
presumably fulfills a catalytically role analogous to that of Arg-15 in
yeast. Although the last Lid arginine in TmpKs (Arg-158 in TmpKcoli)
aligns well with catalytic arginines from pig adenylate kinase (AKpig)
and Dictyostelium uridylate kinase (UmpKdicty), it points away from
the active site, thus having no obvious catalytic role. The eukaryotic
TmpKs have no catalytic residues in the Lid region.

is involved in stabilizing the transition state (24). Ras and
Ras-like proteins do not have an equivalent arginine residue
and are consequently much slower GTPases than the Ga
subunit. However, such a residue can be supplied by GTPaseactivating proteins (GAPs), turning them into efficient GTPhydrolyzing enzymes. Comparing the structure of the Gia
transition state analog complex (24) with those of similar
complexes such as Ras–RasGAP (25) or Rho–RhoGAP (26)
shows that the catalytic arginine, while fulfilling the role of
stabilizing the transition state by interaction with the g-phosphate, approaches this phosphate from quite different directions. Thus, in GTPases and kinases, catalysis by arginine can
occur as long as the interaction with the transferred phosphate
group is possible, regardless of where the arginine is located in
the secondary structure. We can now identify four different
situations for catalytic arginines in phosphate-transferring
enzymes; the arginine can be located in the P loop (TmpKyeast),
in another region (Lid region of a single domain protein such
as TmpKcoli and various other NMP kinases), in a different
domain of a multidomain protein (heterotrimeric G proteins),
or in another protein capable of interacting with the phosphate-transferring protein (Ras–RasGAP). Interestingly,
there are differences in the details of the interactions, as can
be seen best by comparing the transition-state analog complex
structures of Gia (24), Ras–RasGAP (25), Rho–RhoGAP (26),
and uridylate kinase (22). Arginine side chains, because they
possess three basic nitrogens, can form the appropriate interaction from a variety of spatial situations.
In NMP kinases there is an additional arginine located
neither in the P loop nor the Lid region that appears to play
an important role. This is residue 100 in TmpKcoli (94 in
TmpKyeast), and it appears to be conserved in structural space
in other members of the family (Fig. 1c). In all cases examined
so far, this residue appears to concomitantly interact with both
the g-phosphate of ATP and the phosphate of the nucleoside

loop arginine. In contrast, in TmpKcoli, the interaction between Glu-12 and the 39-hydroxyl is side-on, and the bulkier azido group does not induce
a significant movement of the P loop. (c) Similar phosphate–arginine interactions made in TmpKyeast by Arg-15 and in TmpKcoli by Arg-153.
Displayed are the P loop and a part of the Lid region. The structures were overlaid according to the position of the bisubstrate inhibitor. (d) In
the TmpKcoli–TP5A and the TmpKcoli–AZTP5A complex structures, the thymine base is at an identical position, but the deoxyribose moiety has
undergone a rigid-body rotation caused by the azido group in the AZT-P5A complex. In addition, Glu-12 has rotated slightly to provide more room
for the azido group. The rotation of the deoxyribose induces a similar rotation of the Glu-160 side chain. As Glu-12 makes close interactions with
Asp-157, the latter carboxylic acid also rotates slightly. b–d were generated by using BOBSCRIPT (29, 30) and RASTER 3D (31).

monophosphate (i.e., the transferred phosphate and the acceptor phosphate). The interactions are with different nitrogens of the arginine side chain, and the possible significance of
this is that such a two pronged interaction could act like a vice
or clamp, pulling the charged phosphate groups toward each
other while partially neutralizing their repulsive negative
charges. However, among the various NMP kinases, this type
of interaction only seems to be crucial for TmpK because
mutagenesis studies have indicated that this residue is not
essential for adenylate kinase activity (27, 28). A possible
explanation for this difference is that TmpKs uses three basic
residues to interact with the transferred phosphoryl group,
whereas adenylate kinase or uridylate kinase use five.
Conclusion. We have shown herein that the capability of the
E. coli P loop glutamic acid to accommodate AZT-MP without
major structural changes in comparison to dTMP, the lack of
a catalytic arginine in the P loop, and the presence of a
presumably catalytic arginine in the Lid region are the structural reasons for the efficient phosphorylation of AZT-MP by
TmpKcoli. The endeavor to use this newly acquired understanding for the purpose of modifying the human TmpK so that
the AZT-MP phosphorylation rate is increased is presently
underway.
