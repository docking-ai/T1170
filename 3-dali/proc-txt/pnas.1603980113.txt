The AAA+ (ATPases associated with a variety of cellular activities)
enzymes play critical roles in a variety of homeostatic processes in
all kingdoms of life. Valosin-containing protein-like ATPase of Thermoplasma acidophilum (VAT), the archaeal homolog of the ubiquitous AAA+ protein Cdc48/p97, functions in concert with the 20S
proteasome by unfolding substrates and passing them on for degradation. Here, we present electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) maps
showing that VAT undergoes large conformational rearrangements
during its ATP hydrolysis cycle that differ dramatically from the
conformational states observed for Cdc48/p97. We validate key features of the model with biochemical and solution methyl-transverse
relaxation optimized spectroscopY (TROSY) NMR experiments and
suggest a mechanism for coupling the energy of nucleotide hydrolysis to substrate unfolding. These findings illustrate the unique
complementarity between cryo-EM and solution NMR for studies
of molecular machines, showing that the structural properties of
VAT, as well as the population distributions of conformers, are similar in the frozen specimens used for cryo-EM and in the solution
phase where NMR spectra are recorded.

the enzymes Cdc48 and p97/VCP, which are homologous to
VAT, play essential roles in a large number of cellular functions,
including transcriptional and metabolic regulation, cell cycle
progression, membrane fusion, apoptosis, and protein degradation (22). Interestingly, eukaryotic analogs of VAT, such as
Cdc48 and p97, lack critical Tyr residues in the pore loops of the
D1 domain that are important for unfolding protein substrates
and passing them into the lumen of the enzyme. However, substitution of the native residues with Tyr and removal of the NTD
in mouse Cdc48 lead to a mutant enzyme that can unfold protein
substrates and collaborate with both mouse and archaeal 20S
CPs in protein degradation (20, 23).
The ATP hydrolysis activity required for the function of VAT
and other AAA+ unfoldases leads to conformational changes in
AAA+ ring structures that vary from local rearrangements of
secondary structure to large-scale domain motions (1, 7, 24–26).
However, the mechanism by which many of these proteins carry
out their function remains to be elucidated. The inherent flexibility of these complexes, coupled with the important role of what
are likely to be large-scale dynamics during the unfoldase cycle,
can complicate structural analyses of the unfolding reaction by

he AAA+ enzymes (ATPases associated with a variety of
cellular activities) use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to carry
out a myriad of different biological functions that are critical to
cellular homeostasis. These molecular machines are typically
barrel-shaped, containing a narrow channel that serves to traffic
substrates through the enzyme (1–4). In the case of the heat
shock protein 104 (Hsp104) AAA+ class of chaperone, for example, substrates are dissociated from aggregates via a pulling
motion that forces individual polypeptide chains through the
central pore of the enzyme (1, 5). The unfolded proteins that
emerge subsequently refold spontaneously or are acted on by
additional chaperones that aid in their refolding (6). Other
AAA+ enzymes act synergistically with proteases, unfolding targeted substrates and passing them directly to the proteases, where
they are subsequently degraded (7). In this way, proteins that have
become damaged or that are no longer required can be removed
before their accumulation disrupts cellular function (8). A variety of different AAA+ unfoldases have been characterized, including Rpt1–6 in the 19S proteasome regulatory particle in
eukaryotes (9–11), PAN in archaea (12–14), Mpa/ARC in
Actinobacteria (15), ClpA/X (2) and HslU (3) in bacteria, and
VAT in the Thermoplasma acidophilum archaebacterium (16–20).
VAT is an ∼500-kDa homohexamer, with each monomer
containing two tandem AAA+ domains, referred to as D1 and
D2, and an N-terminal domain (NTD) distinct from the NTD of
other AAA+ enzymes (16) (Fig. 1A). Both D1 and D2 are homologous to the single AAA+ modules of PAN and Rpt1–6 (1, 16).
Biochemical studies have shown that VAT unfolds globular
proteins and interacts directly with the 20S core particle (CP) of
the proteasome, leading to enhanced proteolytic activity for both
folded and unfolded protein substrates (18–21). In eukaryotes,

Significance
Cellular function is tightly regulated by large molecular assemblies such as the proteasome, which is involved in the removal of
damaged or misfolded proteins. Proteasome substrates are unfolded by complexes such as valosin-containing protein-like
ATPase of Thermoplasma acidophilum (VAT) via a process
that is coupled to ATP hydrolysis. We used a combined electron
cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) and NMR analysis to show that VAT
undergoes large, previously unidentified, conformational
changes that are essential for substrate unfolding and to suggest
a model by which the energy released upon ATP hydrolysis can
be coupled to the unfolding process. Our approach demonstrates
that cryo-EM/NMR studies offer the exciting potential of obtaining
both structural and dynamic information that, together, can provide a detailed understanding of how molecular machines function.

X-ray crystallography. In this context, the emergence of other
biophysical methods, such as electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM)
(27, 28) and solution NMR spectroscopy (NMR) (29, 30), offers
unique possibilities to examine both the structure and the dynamics of AAA+ machines such as VAT, the focus of this report.
The introduction of direct detector device (DDD) cameras for
electron microscopes has dramatically improved the signal-to-noise
ratio in cryo-EM images, allowing calculation of 3D maps that
resolve protein secondary structure, and even side-chain detail in
many cases, for proteins as small as 150 kDa (31). Perhaps equally
important, the enhanced signal from DDDs allows effective sorting of populations of single-particle images into classes corresponding to different 3D structures, enabling the identification of
different conformations of molecules that exist simultaneously in
the specimen (32, 33). However, how the populations of these
different 3D classes from ice-embedded specimens relate to conformer populations existing in solution remains unclear.
Studies of biomolecules by solution NMR have traditionally
been limited to systems with aggregate molecular masses on the
order of 50 kDa or less. However, the development of new NMR
experiments that protect against rapid signal decay using the
transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopY (TROSY) principle (34, 35) along with labeling approaches that can be optimally
exploited by the TROSY approach (36), coupled with hardware
improvements such as cryogenically cooled probes, has significantly reduced the size barriers that were once so limiting. It is thus
possible to obtain detailed, site-specific, structural and dynamical

information on molecular complexes in the 1-MDa size range (37).
In this regard, combined cryo-EM/NMR studies offer the exciting
potential of obtaining both high-resolution structures (from
cryo-EM) and dynamics (from NMR) that, together, can lead to
a more complete understanding of function than what could be
obtained from either method in isolation.
With this synergy in mind, we present a structural and biochemical investigation of the VAT AAA+ unfoldase using a
combined cryo-EM/solution NMR approach. Analysis of the cryoEM data establishes distinct conformations for the hexameric VAT
ring in ATPγS- and ADP-loaded states, suggesting a large-scale
domain rearrangement during cycles of nucleotide binding and
hydrolysis. In the ADP-loaded state, VAT protomers are arranged
in a helical manner, resulting in a split-ring conformation. In
contrast, when loaded with ATPγS, VAT adopts both the split-ring
structure and a conformation whereby pairs of rings comprising the
six D1 and six D2 domains stack collinearly, with the sixfold symmetry axis running through the central pore of the complex. The
structures elucidated by cryo-EM are validated through biochemical and NMR studies. Notably, reasonable agreement was
obtained between cryo-EM and NMR analyses of the relative
populations of split- and stacked-ring conformations, especially
considering that the cryo-EM specimen was prepared by rapid
freezing of a solution from 4 °C, whereas the NMR studies were
performed at 60 °C. This level of agreement demonstrates that the
rapid freezing used in cryo-EM studies faithfully preserved equilibrium solution populations and that 3D classification can measure

these populations accurately. Finally, a series of ATP hydrolysis
and substrate unfolding studies using a cross-linked version of VAT
that is locked into the split-ring conformation establishes the
importance of the split-/stacked-ring conformational interconversion
for optimal VAT function. In addition to providing insights into the
structure and function of VAT, the present work illustrates the
unique complementarity between cryo-EM and solution NMR in
studies of molecular machines.
Results
Cryo-EM Structures of ADP- and ATPγS-Bound VAT Complexes Show
Distinct Conformations. We used single-particle cryo-EM to obtain

structural models of the hexameric AAA+ protein VAT in both
ADP- and ATPγS-loaded states. For the ADP-loaded state, 912
micrographs were collected and subjected to automatic particle
selection, 2D classification, and 3D classification, with no symmetry applied. This analysis yielded a single asymmetrical 3D
class containing 71,258 particle images that was refined to 7.0-Å
resolution, sufficient to resolve α-helices clearly (Figs. S1 and S2).
The map shows VAT in a split-ring conformation that has not
been observed previously for p97/VCP (38–42). For the ATPγSloaded state, 514 micrographs were collected and subjected to a
similar analysis. However, for this state, two distinct 3D classes
were detected: one that resembled the split-ring conformation
seen for the ADP-loaded state and an additional stacked-ring
conformation that appeared sixfold symmetrical, reminiscent of
crystal structures and EM maps of p97/VCP (38–42) (Fig. S3). The
asymmetrical split-ring map from the ATPγS-loaded state was
refined to 12-Å resolution with 7,539 particle images, whereas the
stacked-ring map was refined to 7.8-Å resolution with 16,538
particle images and the application of C6 symmetry (Fig. 1 B–D
and Fig. S1). Alignment in three dimensions and Fourier shell
correlation (criterion of 0.5) of the split-ring conformations from
the ADP- and ATPγS-loaded states of VAT show the maps to be
identical up to the 12-Å resolution limit of the map of this conformation from the ATPγS-loaded state (Fig. S4); consequently,
we consider the split-ring conformation from the two different
enzyme preparations to be equivalent. To date, there is no atomic

resolution structure of VAT. However, an atomic model is available for a mammalian homolog, mouse p97 (39–42), which has
∼45% sequence identity with the T. acidophilum VAT. Thus, a
homology model was built for VAT using the crystal structure of
mouse p97 [Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID code 3CF3] and the
NMR structure of VAT NTD (PDB ID code 1CZ4). The D1, D2,
and NTD domains of the model were fit independently into the
corresponding cryo-EM density maps and subsequently refined by
molecular dynamics flexible fitting (43).
In the sixfold symmetrical, stacked-ring conformation of VAT
(Fig. 1 B and C), the D1 and D2 rings are both planar and align
on top of each other coaxially, with the NTDs packed against the
periphery of the D1 ring in a coplanar fashion. Unwinding the
protomer arrangement shown in Fig. 1C produces the “structural
snap-shots” illustrated in Fig. 1D. Notably, the “tops” and “bottoms” of each protomer align, as expected, due to the symmetry of
the model.
Upon ADP binding, VAT adopts a split-ring conformation as
indicated in Fig. 1E and in the schematic of Fig. 1F. The arrangement of protomers is helical, with each successive protomer
descending along the z axis of the map (Fig. 1F), and we have
chosen to label the protomers from 1 to 6 as indicated in Fig. 1.
However, the split-ring helix has a variable pitch with larger steps
along the z axis from protomer 1 to 2 and from protomer 5 to 6
than between other adjacent protomers. This unequal spacing
can be seen in Fig. 1G, where the protomers of the split-ring
structure have been unwound to produce snap-shots that show
the relative differences in translation along the z axis.
The structures of the six individual protomers in the split-ring
conformation can be superimposed well, but the relative orientations of the D1 and D2 domains differ slightly in each protomer, with a variance of ∼1.2°. Notably, the progressive descent of
protomers along the z axis leads to a substantial offset between
protomers 1 and 6, forming an atypical interface between them
(compare dashed boxes in Fig. 1 C and F). In the case of the
split-ring structure, D2 of protomer 1 is in direct contact with
NTD/D1 of protomer 6. In this conformation NTD/D1 of protomer 1 and D2 of protomer 6 lack contacts with neighboring

protomers that are present at the other protomer–protomer interfaces. Close inspection of the protomer 1–protomer 6 interface establishes that the contacts formed between D1 and D2
are similar to the D1/D1 and D2/D2 contacts at the other interfaces, reflecting the high degree of sequence similarity between
the D1 and D2 domains.
A comparison of the split- and stacked-ring conformers suggests
that large-scale domain movements accompany the nucleotide
hydrolysis cycle in VAT. In addition to the apparent movements in
the positions of the protomers along the z axis that accompany the
split-/stacked-ring interconversion, as can be seen in a comparison
of Fig. 1 B–D and E–G, each protomer undergoes relative rotations
of the D1 and D2 domains by ∼14° (Fig. S5 and Movie S1). The
rotation of each protomer suggests a cooperative mechanism by
which the pivoting of each subunit around the D1-D2 linker accompanies the large-scale rearrangement of the hexamer from a
stacked-ring conformation to a split-ring conformation or vice versa.
Intramolecular Cross-Linking Validates the ADP Split-Ring Conformation.

As described above, ADP-bound VAT was observed to exist exclusively in a split-ring conformation, whereas both split- and
stacked-ring structures were obtained for the ATPγS-loaded
complex. To establish that the split-ring conformation of ADPVAT is not an artifact of the freezing process and is populated
in solution, we performed cross-linking studies. Here, a cysteine-free construct of VAT (C77A/C679A) was used, into which
a pair of cysteines, K111C (localized to the NTD) and K494C

(on D2), was introduced in each protomer via mutagenesis.
Positions 111 and 494 were chosen based on the cryo-EM
model of ADP-VAT, which shows that among the 12 cysteines
introduced into each VAT hexamer in this manner, only two
are sufficiently close to each other for disulfide bond formation
(Cβ within 8 Å), with all other pairs more than 43 Å apart (Fig.
2A). We would thus predict on the basis of the cryo-EM model
that a single intramolecular disulfide bond would be formed
between the two cysteines at the interface between protomers 1
and 6, as depicted by the black line in Fig. 2B.
Copper-1,10-phenanthroline was used as an oxidizing catalyst
to promote disulfide bond formation (44). The solvent accessibility of the added cysteines can result in intermolecular crosslinking, leading to dodecamers or higher order oligomers of
ADP-VAT, as depicted in Fig. 2C (Left Inset). Therefore, we first
characterized the oxidation product by size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Higher order oligomers of VAT that result from
inter-VAT cross-linking could be distinguished and separated
from hexameric VAT by SEC (Fig. 2C). Different fractions in
the SEC elution profile were subjected to further analysis by
native gel electrophoresis. The native gel resolves dodecameric
and hexameric VAT complexes (Fig. 2D, Upper), from which the
percentage of each species in each fraction could be quantified
(Fig. 2D, Lower). Consistent with their respective elution volumes, the VAT compositions of fractions 1–5 show a transition
from the dodecameric species (fraction 1) to the hexameric
species (fraction 5), with an inversion in the relative amounts of
each species from fraction 1 to fraction 5. Further insight into the
population distribution of cross-linked protomers was obtained
from SDS/PAGE, where one protomer (86 kDa), two linked
protomers (172 kDa), and three linked protomers (258 kDa)
were observed (Fig. 2E). Approximately 45% of the total number
of protomers are found as the one-protomer species in SEC
fraction 1, which increases to ∼65% in fraction 5. The amount of
the two-protomer species remains constant throughout the SEC
fractions, but the amount of the three-protomer species decreases significantly from fraction 1 to fraction 5. Because the
three-protomer species can only result from formation of
dodecamers or higher order oligomers, the decreasing number of
the three-protomer species in SDS/PAGE with increasing fraction
number (Fig. 2E, light green) mirrors the decrease in the percentage of dodecamers in the corresponding fractions in the native
gel (Fig. 2D, green). Notably, in fraction 5, which is predominantly
composed of hexameric VAT (>95%; Fig. 2D), the number of
protomers in cross-linked two-protomer and single-protomer
species has an approximate ratio of 1:2 (Fig. 2E). This result is
consistent with an intramolecular disulfide bond connecting two of
the six protomers (33%) in a VAT molecule, as indicated schematically in Fig. 2B and predicted on the basis of the cryo-EM
split-ring model of ADP-VAT.
Once the asymmetrically cross-linked hexamer was isolated, an
excess of maleimide was added to “cap” cysteine residues at the
remaining 111 and 494 positions to prevent formation of dodecamers or higher order structures, as described in SI Materials and
Methods. The oxidation product of fraction 5 was further subjected
to digestion with trypsin, followed by mass spectrometry characterization, confirming the existence of protein fragments crosslinked by residues 111 and 494. As a final test, we carried out
cryo-EM analysis of cross-linked C111-C494 ATP-VAT. In contrast to wild-type (wt) ATPγS-bound VAT, where both split- and
stacked-ring conformations were observed, formation of the
disulfide bond led exclusively to the split-ring structure (Fig. S6).
Taken together, the structural and biochemical data demonstrate
the spatial proximity of K111 and K494 at a single-protomer interface of VAT in the ADP-loaded state and provide strong evidence in support of the split-ring model.

Structural and Dynamic Heterogeneity in the Split-Ring VAT
Conformation. The arrangement of protomers forming the split-

ring helical conformation shown in Fig. 1 E–G results in different
protomer–protomer interfaces along the z axis. The interface
between protomers 1 and 6 is distinct from the other protomer–
protomer interfaces, shown schematically in Fig. 1F (using the
same numbering scheme as above), where the interface is formed
between NTD/D1 of protomer 6 and D2 of protomer 1. In
contrast, the other protomer interfaces are stabilized by contacts
involving D1/D1 and D2/D2 interactions between domains of
neighboring protomers. The lack of interprotomer contacts involving D2 of protomer 6 at the interface between protomers
1 and 6 leads to structural heterogeneity, as can be seen clearly in
the cryo-EM maps. Fig. 3 A and B highlights D2 domains of
protomers 2 (blue) and 6 (red) in the context of the full structure
(A) and for the extracted domains (B), clearly illustrating that
the relative density for the D2 subunit of protomer 6 is lower
than for the other protomers, suggesting conformational heterogeneity. Fig. 3C shows a map of local resolution (45) in the
split-ring conformation, and includes a pair of slices through the
resolution map for regions corresponding to the D1 (Top) and
D2 (Bottom) domains, which emphasizes the limited resolution
in the map for D2 of protomer 6.
To explore the structural and dynamic heterogeneity within
VAT further, we used solution-based NMR techniques that are
optimized for studies of high-molecular-weight complexes. Typical applications make use of 13CH3 labeling of Ile, Leu, Met,
and Val methyl groups in an otherwise highly deuterated background, in concert with methyl-TROSY–based experiments that
exploit the labeling scheme (30, 37). Although labeling methyl
groups from a variety of amino acids increases the number of
probes of structure and dynamics, a drawback is that cross-peaks
in spectra must first be assigned to specific residues in the primary sequence, and the assignment process can be a major
bottleneck in applications involving a 500-kDa complex with

protomer subunits approaching 100 kDa in molecular mass. We
therefore made use of an alternative strategy whereby methyl
groups are added to key positions that directly report on structural and/or dynamic features of interest. This specificity is
achieved through the use of 13C-methyl-methanethiosulfonate
(13C-MMTS), which labels cysteine side chains with 13CH3-S to
form S-methylthio-cysteine (46). To this end, we introduced a
single cysteine mutation into cysteine-free VAT (C77A/C679A)
at three positions (111, 652, and 684; one per sample) followed
by attachment of 13CH3 groups to the highly deuterated protein,
using a procedure described previously (46). Fig. 4A shows that
residues 111, 652, and 684 localize to the NTD (111, green) and
D2 (652, red and 684, orange) domains of VAT.
Unlike what would be expected for a symmetrical hexamer, we
observed two cross-peaks for 13CH3 groups attached to positions
684 (Fig. 4B, i) and 652 (Fig. 4B, ii) in methyl-TROSY 13C-1H–
correlated NMR spectra (35) of ADP-loaded VAT, suggesting
two distinct local environments for these methyl probes. The
cross-peaks do not originate from a heterogeneous population of
VAT molecules composed of intact and proteolyzed complexes,
for example, because diffusion constants obtained from pulse-field
gradient NMR measurements (47) quantifying each peak separately are statistically identical: 2.7 ± 0.3 and 2.6 ± 0.3 × 10−7 cm2·s−1
for peaks A and B, respectively (Fig. 4C, blue and red; 40 °C).
Notably, the diffusion of the VAT complex is slower than for the
half-proteasome (30) control, α7α7 (4.6 ± 0.3 × 10−7 cm2·s−1), as
expected on the basis of the lower molecular mass of the α7α7
complex (360 kDa vs. 500 kDa; Fig. 4C, gray).
A clue as to the identities of peaks A and B is obtained from
their fractional areas (quantified by peak integration) of 28 ± 2%
and 72 ± 4%, respectively, as measured in spectra with the label
at D2 position 684 (Fig. 4 B, i) or 652 (Fig. 4 B, ii). Skewed areas
would be expected if peaks A and B originate from methyl spin
probes localized to protomer 6 and potentially protomer 5 (peak
A), and to protomers 1–4 (peak B), with a ratio approximately

the same as observed experimentally. Moreover, that pairs of
peaks are observed is consistent with the cryo-EM model of the
split-ring conformation that establishes distinct arrangements of
the D2 domains for protomers 1–4 vs. protomer 6, and thus different magnetic environments for the attached methyl probes. For
example, the methyl probe in protomer 6 is localized to a region
of low density in the EM map, whereas the corresponding probe
in protomer 5 faces D2 of “structurally heterogeneous” protomer
6. Thus, probes in protomers 5 and 6 could well have identical
chemical shifts (peak A), with similar shifts for the remaining
methyls in protomers 1–4 (peak B). If this assignment is correct, a
prediction would be that placement of an S-methylthio-cysteine
residue in a position that is much less “heterogeneous” across the
protomers would give rise to a single peak in NMR spectra. We
therefore recorded spectra with a methyl probe localized to position 111 in the complex (Fig. 4A, green), and only a single peak
was observed (Fig. 4 B, iii).
To support this assignment further, we carried out paramagnetic relaxation NMR experiments by adding a soluble spin
label, Gd(III)DTPA-BMA (48), that leads to a decrease in the
signal intensity from an NMR active probe by an amount related
to its surface accessibility, and hence exposure to the paramagnet. Fig. 4D shows the intensity change of peaks in spectra of
M684C-13CH3 ADP-VAT, plotted as a series of 1H projections
from 2D 13C-1H datasets, as a function of added paramagnet.
Notably, peak A decreases much more rapidly than peak B. We
also measured methyl 1H transverse relaxation (R2,S) rates (49)

Shifts in VAT Conformational Landscape with Different Nucleotides.

We recorded methyl-TROSY spectra of 13CH3-labeled S-methylthiocysteine attached to position 684 in the apo (Fig. 5A, green),
ADP-loaded (Fig. 5A, red), and ATPγS-loaded (Fig. 5A, purple)
states. We also attempted to study adenylyl-imidodiphosphate
(AMP-PNP)–loaded VAT; however, the sample was not stable
and precipitated above 40 °C. In analogy to the ADP-bound
form, protomer states A and B could be assigned for both the
ATPγS and apo forms of the complex, with the methyl probe in
state A clearly more dynamic than probes in state B. As with
ADP-VAT, there appears to be increased conformational heterogeneity in state B for ATPγS- and apo-VAT, especially for
the apo form of the enzyme, where multiple dispersed peaks are
observed. Notably, it was only possible to obtain a cryo-EM map
at ∼30-Å resolution from 16,585 particle images for nucleotidefree VAT, consistent with the structural heterogeneity observed
by NMR. It is worth noting that the significant change in the
position of peak A in the ATPγS state is likely due to the nucleotide

(Fig. 4E); because the rate is biexponential for a methyl group
attached to a protein (35), we selected the slowly relaxing component of magnetization (49). As expected, R2,S rates increase
much more rapidly as a function of Gd(III)DTPA-BMA concentration for peak A than for peak B. This observation, together
with the faster decrease in intensity for the peak A resonance,
indicates that peak A derives from probes localized to regions
with higher solvent accessibilities than for peak B. In this regard,
it is noteworthy that solvent accessibilities for positions 684 and
652, as calculated from the split-ring VAT model, are significantly
higher for protomer 6 than for protomers 1–4, especially for position 684, where the surface accessibility is ∼90% for protomer 6,
relative to 20–30% for protomers 1–4. Note that we have chosen
not to report surface accessibilities for residues 652 and 684 of
protomer 5 because the region of D2 containing these residues
faces protomer 6, which is not well defined, and any calculation
of accessibility that does not take into account the dynamics of
protomer 6 would not be meaningful. The 1H R2,S rate measured for peak A of M684C-13CH3 ADP-VAT in the absence
of Gd(III)DTPA-BMA (24.5 ± 1.3 s−1) is significantly
smaller than the value for peak B (53.8 ± 2.0 s−1) (Fig. 4E;
[Gd(III)DTPA-BMA] = 0), suggesting higher flexibility for the
S-methylthio-cysteine probe in protomer 6 relative to the other
protomers, as expected on the basis of the high surface accessibility calculated from the cryo-EM map. The increased mobility of
the probe localized to protomer 6 was further confirmed by recording an F1-scalar–coupled 1H-13C heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) dataset of M684C-13CH3 ADP-VAT
(Fig. S7). For a highly dynamic methyl group, and neglecting relaxation, a 3:1:1:3 quartet structure is expected in such a spectrum
(50). In contrast, for methyls attached to slowly tumbling macromolecules, the outer lines decay approximately ninefold faster
than the inner components (51, 52), so that for rigid methyl
groups, the outer lines often disappear (35). It is clear that the
outer lines are significantly more pronounced for peak A than for
peak B, indicating increased dynamics at this site (protomer 6).
Having established that peaks A and B provide direct probes
of the different D2 domains of protomers 1–6, we were interested
in measuring the rate of protomer interconversion (i.e., exchange
between protomer states giving rise to peaks A and B). To this
end, magnetization exchange experiments (53) were recorded;
notably, cross-peaks connecting the two states were not observed.
Calculations establish an upper bound for the exchange rate, kex =
kAB
kAB + kBA, on the order of 0.2 s−1 for the A !
 B process (Fig. S8),
kBA
where A and B denote the protomer states giving rise to peaks A
and B, respectively. Such a slow rate might be expected on the
basis of the large activation barrier that no doubt must be overcome in the interconversion between two conformers with significantly different structures.

because the position of the probe is proximal to the nucleotide
binding pocket.
We quantified the relative intensities of cross-peaks A and B
for the nucleotide-bound and nucleotide-free forms of VAT as
indicated in Fig. 5A, which can be directly related to populations
of the split- and stacked-ring structures. Significant differences in
intensities were observed for the different nucleotide states, indicating that the relative abundance of split- and stacked-ring
conformers can be controlled through the binding of nucleotides.
Assuming that only the split-ring conformer is present in the
ADP-loaded state in solution, as is suggested by our cryo-EM
analysis, we calculated fractional populations of 28 ± 4% and
72 ± 4% for split- and stacked-ring structures in the ATPγSbound form of VAT in solution (Fig. 5B, Right) from the populations of the A/B protomer states.
We also estimated the populations of the two different conformations of the ATPγS-loaded VAT complex by comparison of
the number of particle images in each class after 3D classification
(Fig. 5B, Left and Center). To determine the systematic error of
this method, we divided the data into three random nonoverlapping subsets that were analyzed separately. The 3D maximum
likelihood classification algorithm that we used (54, 55) requires
an initial 3D reference to begin the classification. To control for
bias introduced by this reference, we performed the 3D classification with a low-pass-filtered (to 40 Å) split-ring map as the
starting reference (Fig. 5B, Left) and a low-pass-filtered stackedring map as the starting reference (Fig. 5B, Center). The populations of the split-ring (42 ± 3%) and stacked-ring (58 ± 3%)
conformations estimated by cryo-EM (Fig. 5B, Left and Center)
show the same trend as the population estimate from NMR (Fig.
5B, Right). Furthermore, a paired Student’s t test was performed
to determine if any bias had been introduced from the starting
model to the calculation of populations, but no significant difference
was observed between runs with different starting models.
Interconversion Between Split- and Stacked-Ring Conformers Is
Essential for Optimal Function. Our cryo-EM results establish

that VAT undergoes a large conformational change between
split- and stacked-ring structures. How might this change be
related to function? To address this question, we returned to the
K111C/K494C VAT double mutant that is cross-linked once per
complex (Fig. 2 C–E; fraction 5), so that the enzyme is locked in
the split-ring conformation [Fig. 2B; subsequently referred to as
cross-linked VAT (VAT*)]. Unfolding activities of VAT* under
both oxidizing and reducing conditions were measured and compared with the unfolding activities of wt VAT. Locking the enzyme
in the split-ring conformation (Fig. 6A; VAT* − DTT) leads to an
approximate 50% decrease in ATPase activity compared with wt
VAT, which can be recovered upon disulfide bond reduction (Fig.
6A; VAT* + DTT). The unfolding activity of VAT was assayed
by measuring the rate of decrease of fluorescence of GFP11 that
E4196 | www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1603980113

accompanies unfolding. To ensure that the unfolded GFP11
cannot refold, we used an assay developed by Horwich and coworkers (56) whereby unfolded GFP11 is captured by a D87K
mutant of GroEL that prevents substrate release. In this manner,
we found that the unfolding activity of locked VAT* is almost
abolished (Fig. 6B; VAT* − DTT), because similar rates of
unfolding are obtained relative to a control that lacks VAT or ATP
(Fig. 6B; no VAT or no ATP). Reduction of the disulfide bond
leads to ∼50% recovery of the net unfolding activity compared
with wt. The lack of complete recovery of unfoldase activity may
be a function of the added cysteines at positions 111 and 494 (12
residues) in combination with maleimide capping of the remaining
10 cysteines so as to prevent formation of higher order structures.
The results of this assay establish the importance of the large split-/
stacked-ring conformational rearrangement for VAT function.
Discussion
Recent advances in cryo-EM, including the development of DDD
cameras, coupled with image classification algorithms, have
greatly facilitated high-resolution structure determination of biomolecular machines (27, 28). Because it is possible to elucidate
structures of different conformers that exist in a specimen, cryoEM offers the possibility of obtaining insight into how conformational changes may be linked to function. However, cryo-EM
experiments involve trapping conformations by rapid freezing and
subsequent quantification of populations with classification algorithms. How accurately these estimates of population distributions
mirror the populations in solution had not been studied previously. Solution NMR spectroscopy has also developed to the
point where atomic resolution studies of molecular machines are
possible (57) through improved instrumentation, novel labeling,
and spin physics methodologies. NMR has emerged as a powerful
tool to characterize different functional states of biomolecules in
solution, even in cases where the states are sparsely populated and
only transiently formed (58). As such, both cryo-EM and solution
NMR are complementary, and a combination of both methods
holds great promise for studies of heterogeneous, dynamic
systems.
Here, we used cryo-EM to produce models of the AAA+
protein VAT in both ADP- and ATPγS-bound states. Notably,
an asymmetrical conformation was observed for the ADP-loaded
state in which the six VAT protomers are arranged as a helix with
variable pitch, leading to differences in interprotomer interfaces
along the helical axis. The difference is especially pronounced
for the first and last protomers in the helix, denoted by 1 and 6 in
Fig. 1 E–G and Fig. 2B, where D1–D2 interactions are formed
rather than the “canonical” D1/D1 and D2/D2 contacts observed
in crystal structures and cryo-EM maps of p97 (38–42) and
manifest in the split-ring arrangement seen for VAT. The result
is that the D2 domain of protomer 6, in particular, lacks many of
the interactions that are present in other D2 domains, and its
Huang et al.

density is notably weak (Fig. 3). This low density in the map is
most likely due to flexibility of this region, which results from the
lack of stabilizing contacts with a neighboring D2 domain. In
contrast to ADP-loaded VAT, where only a single conformer is
observed, both split- and stacked-ring structures are present in
EM specimens of ATPγS-VAT. The stacked-ring conformation
positions the D1 and D2 hexameric rings on top of each other,
forming a cylindrical structure (Figs. 1 B–D). The large structural
changes between stacked- and split-ring conformers described
above are also accompanied by rotations of ∼14° between D1
and D2 domains within a given protomer (Fig. S5). To validate
the asymmetrical split-ring structure, we used a combined biochemical and solution NMR approach. We show that a single
interprotomer disulfide bond connecting protomers 1 and 6 can
be formed between cysteine residues introduced at positions 111
(NTD) and 494 (D2). This cross-link is consistent with the cryoEM model of the split-ring conformation, which places residues
111 of protomer 6 and 494 of protomer 1 within 8 Å of each
other, whereas the remaining cysteine–cysteine distances in the
split-ring form and all such distances in the stacked-ring conformation are greater than 43 Å. Further, cryo-EM studies of the
disulfide-linked complex in the ATP-loaded state establish that
only the split-ring structure is formed, in contrast to the mixed
population of split- and stacked-ring structures present in wt
VAT under similar conditions.
Additional validation experiments were done using methylTROSY–based solution NMR. Here, we used an approach
whereby a single NMR methyl probe is added at a key site that
has been converted to a cysteine residue in a highly deuterated
protein to form 13CH3-labeled S-methylthio-cysteine (46). There
is no need for assignment of the observed resonance (or resonances) because it (or they) must derive from the added probe,
so that NMR studies can proceed rapidly. Methyl probes attached
at either D2 domain position 652 or 684 establish a pair of unique
states, A and B, that report on protomers 6 (and possibly 5) and 1–
4, respectively. Paramagnetic relaxation enhancement experiments
of ADP-VAT using the water-soluble reagent Gd(III)DTPABMA show that state A is much more surface-exposed, as
expected from the cryo-EM structure of ADP-VAT, and that
local dynamics of the methyl probe at position 684 are much
larger in state A than in state B. NMR magnetization exchange
experiments further establish that an upper bound for the rate of
interconversion between states A and B is 0.2 s−1 (Fig. S8), which
is in keeping with the large conformational changes that are required. It is worth emphasizing that the 13CH3-labeled S-methylthio-cysteines at positions 652 and 684 are unlikely to perturb the
structure because the original residues at these positions were
methionines with the only difference between S-methylthiocysteine
and methionine being the replacement of Cγ by S.

Fig. 7. Proposed mechanism for VAT function. (Left) Schematic of the ATPVAT structure showing the sixfold symmetrical arrangement of the protomers and the position of the D1 pore loop residues (red) at the top of the
structure. Binding of folded substrate (blue) occurs initially via the pore
loops (Center), with subsequent ATP hydrolysis generating the force required for substrate unfolding and threading through the axial pore (Right).

NMR spectra of M684C-13CH3 VAT were recorded in apo,
ADP, and ATPγS states, showing that nucleotides shift the relative intensities of peaks A and B from ∼10:90 (ATPγS) to 30:70
(ADP), with a ratio of 20:80 for apo-VAT (as measured by peak
integration). From these data, and assuming that ADP-VAT
forms only the split-ring conformer in solution, as observed in
cryo-EM specimens, a 28:72 ratio between split- and stacked-ring
structures is calculated for the ATPγS-loaded form of the enzyme. This result is in reasonable agreement with the 42 ± 2:58 ±
2 ratio estimated from image classification of conformers in EM
specimens obtained with two different starting models (Fig. 5B
and Fig. S9), and suggests that rapid freezing during the process
of sample preparation for cryo-EM analysis largely preserves the
equilibrium solution distribution of VAT conformers. Differences in ratios may reflect the fact that VAT is frozen from 4 °C,
whereas NMR spectra were recorded at 60 °C. It is worth noting
that the populations of the VAT conformers were of similar
magnitude in the present study. It will be of interest to do further
comparisons between cryo-EM and NMR-based measurements,
focusing on systems where it is known from NMR studies that
the relative populations are more highly skewed, keeping in mind
that temperature differences can change expected distributions
of conformers.
The sixfold symmetrical, stacked-ring conformation of ATPγSloaded VAT resembles the crystal structure of homologous Mus
musculus p97/VCP in complex with a mixture of ADP and ADPAlF6 (42) and recent high-resolution cryo-EM structures of p97
in different nucleotide states (38, 39) and in the presence or
absence of an allosteric inhibitor (38). Consequently, it was
surprising to observe that in the ADP-bound conformation, the
protomers arrange in a helical manner so as to generate an
asymmetrical, split-ring structure. That a similar conformer has
not been observed for p97, especially considering the high degree
of sequence identity between the two molecules (55% when the
NTD is excluded), may well reflect distinct functional mechanisms for p97 and VAT. For example, biochemical and structural
studies suggest that p97 likely does not function by unfolding
substrates and passing them through its central pore (42, 59) and
a key Tyr-Tyr sequence in the pore loops of VAT D1 that is
implicated in substrate translocation is replaced by Leu-Ala in
p97 (23).
Notably, there are precedents for asymmetrical AAA+ ATPase
rings, as observed for ADP-VAT. For example, ClpX, a prokaryotic unfoldase consisting of a single AAA+ ring, forms a
highly asymmetrical structure that is closely correlated to its
mechanism of nucleotide binding and hydrolysis as well as substrate unfolding (2). A related asymmetrical structure was also
recently observed for Vps4, a single AAA+ ring involved in
membrane remodeling (4). NSF, an AAA+ protein closely related
to VAT and p97/VCP/Cdc48, is also composed of tandem ATPase
rings. A recent cryo-EM study reported a “washer-shaped” AAA+
ring structure for the D1 domains of NSF, with an “open,” essentially planar ring structure observed in the ADP-bound state
and a “closed” structure for the ATP conformation, whereby each
D1 domain is translated by ∼5 Å along the axis extending from D1
to D2 (60).
The helical architecture of VAT in the ADP-bound state is
somewhat reminiscent of the structure of the single-ring AAA+
unfoldase component of the 19S regulatory particle from the 26S
proteasome, where Rpt1–6 subunits are also arranged in a spiralstaircase manner (9, 10). This type of helical arrangement is
often observed for other AAA+ proteins, such as the yeast
replication factor C (61), the bacterial DnaA AAA+ domain
(62), the bacterial IstB domain (63), and the eukaryotic MCM
E1 helicase (64), implying a potential evolutionary conservation
in the architecture of these proteins despite varying structural
features and distinct biological functions.

It has been proposed that VAT functions via a substrate
threading mechanism (18) similar to the mechanism used by
other AAA+ unfoldases, such as ClpX and ClpA (65, 66),
whereby protein substrates are unfolded and threaded through
the central pore of the unfoldase and subsequently passed into
the degradation chamber of the 20S proteasome CP. The mechanical force for this process is generated from repeated cycles
of ATP binding and hydrolysis. Substrates are pulled through the
narrow channel of the unfoldase via attachment to pore loops
located at the entrance and in the interior of the channel (65, 67–
70), which also play a role in substrate recognition in some
AAA+ machines (5, 71–73). In the case of VAT, mutations of
pore loop residues Y264 in D1 and W541/V542 in D2 cause
severe defects on substrate unfolding and translocation (18). The
stacked- and split-ring structures reported here suggest a plausible model for the substrate unfolding mechanism of VAT that
is coupled to ATP hydrolysis (Fig. 7). In the stacked-ring, symmetrical conformation of ATP-VAT, the pore loops in D1 localize to the entrance of the central channel in a coplanar
fashion and provide the point of initial contact with substrate at
the beginning of the ATP hydrolysis cycle. ATP hydrolysis leads
to a conformational change, placing the pore loops at different z
positions in the split-ring conformer so as to generate differential
pulling forces on various parts of the substrate. The central pore
of the stacked-ring conformation is disrupted in the split-ring
conformation to become a helix. The path through the complex
enclosed by this helical opening is constricted relative to the pore
of the stacked-ring, as seen in Movie S1. The net result is an
unraveling of structure and concomitant translocation into
the degradation machinery (Fig. 7). In addition, the structural
rearrangements that accompany ATP hydrolysis would destroy
the pair of nucleotide binding sites on the interface between
protomers 1 and 6, possibly promoting ADP release at the end of
the reaction cycle so that ATP can be reloaded for the next
round of hydrolysis.
The structural asymmetry and the large conformational
changes that accompany nucleotide binding and hydrolysis, as
described here in the context of VAT, are also features of other
AAA+-based molecular machines. Such structural changes likely

play important roles in generating the mechanical forces that are
necessary to act on the target substrates, although the details will
vary with each system. It is clear that recent developments in
both cryo-EM and solution NMR now set the stage for in-depth
studies of how changes in molecular conformation in a variety of
different supramolecular assemblies translate into function.

A total of 2.5 μL of sample was applied onto nanofabricated holey carbon
grids (74) with a hole size of ∼1 μm and blotted using a modified FEI Vitribot
for 5 s before plunge-freezing in a liquid ethane/propane mixture (ratio of
∼60:40%). VAT* was prepared for imaging in the same way as wt VAT, but
with ATP instead of ATPγS to prevent reduction of the disulfide bond.
Movies consisting of 30 frames with two frames per second were collected
with defocuses ranging from 1.8 to 3.5 μm using a FEI Tecnai F20 microscope
operating at 200 kV and equipped with a Gatan K2 DDD camera. Movies
were collected in counting mode with an exposure of five electrons per pixel
per second, with a total exposure of ∼35 electrons per square angstrom.
Additional details are provided in SI Materials and Methods.
NMR Experiments. All NMR experiments were performed on Varian Inova and
Bruker Avance III HD 14.0-T spectrometers equipped with cryogenically cooled,
pulse-field gradient triple-resonance probes. The 13C-1H HMQC spectra were
recorded at 60 °C, exploiting a methyl-TROSY effect to obtain high-quality
datasets (35). Sample (subunit) concentrations varied from 500 to 800 μM, with
protein dissolved in the NMR buffer [25 mM potassium phosphate, 50 mM
NaCl, 4.3 mM NaN3, 1 mM EDTA (pH 7.5) in 99.9% D2O]. Nucleotides (ADP or
ATPγS) were added into the NMR sample to a final concentration of 5 mM. For
ATPγS-bound VAT, 10 mM MgCl2 was also included in the buffer.
A description of protein expression and purification, further details of
NMR experiments, and a discussion of functional assays are given in SI Materials and Methods.
