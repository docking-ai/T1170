The hexameric membrane-spanning ATP-dependent metalloprotease FtsH is universally conserved in eubacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts, where it fulfills key functions in quality
control and signaling. As a member of the self-compartmentalizing
ATPases associated with various cellular activities (AAAⴙ proteases), FtsH converts the chemical energy stored in ATP via
conformational rearrangements into a mechanical force that is
used for substrate unfolding and translocation into the proteolytic
chamber. The crystal structure of the ADP state of Thermotoga
maritima FtsH showed a hexameric assembly consisting of a 6-fold
symmetric protease disk and a 2-fold symmetric AAA ring. The 2.6
Å resolution structure of the cytosolic region of apo-FtsH presented
here reveals a new arrangement where the ATPase ring shows
perfect 6-fold symmetry with the crucial pore residues lining an
open circular entrance. Triggered by this conformational change, a
substrate-binding edge beta strand appears within the proteolytic
domain. Comparison of the apo- and ADP-bound structure visualizes an inward movement of the aromatic pore residues and
generates a model of substrate translocation by AAAⴙ proteases.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that mutation of a conserved glycine in the linker region inactivates FtsH.

T

he ATPases associated with various cellular activities
(AAA⫹) family comprises a large group of proteins which
share a common ATPase module, carrying the Walker A and B
and other conserved sequence motifs (1, 2). They function as
oligomers and usually form hexa- or heptameric rings, whereas
in some cases oligomerization is ATP-dependent. AAA⫹ proteins are present in all kingdoms of life and participate in a wide
range of different actions such as protein disaggregation, complex remodeling, and protein degradation (reviewed in refs. 3–5).
In these processes, the energy of ATP is converted into a
mechanical force by large conformational rearrangements. Until
now, information on these immense structural changes is sparse;
x-ray studies on HslU (6) and p97 (7) revealed only relatively
small changes between the conformations of apo, ADP, and
ATP state. In contrast, electron microscopic studies of p97 (8)
and of the chaperone ClpB (9) displayed very large conformational rearrangements of the AAA domains.
The membrane-bound metalloprotease FtsH (10, 11) is a homohexameric complex that carries, contrary to most other AAA⫹
proteases, the AAA and proteolytic domain on the same polypeptide chain. The AAA domain bears the Walker A and B motifs
necessary for nucleotide binding and hydrolysis; the second region
of homology (SRH), which carries conserved arginine residues
(‘‘arginine fingers’’) for oligomerization and nucleotide hydrolysis;
and the conserved FGV pore motif required for substrate recognition and translocation. The protease domain exhibits the zincbinding HEXXH finger print. The N-terminal AAA domain is
preceded by 2 transmembrane helices flanking a small periplasmic
region, thereby locating the largest part of the protein complex in

the cytoplasm. FtsH is universally conserved in eubacteria, chloroplasts, and mitochondria as it has an essential function in protein
turnover and processing. Of the 5 energy-dependent AAA⫹ proteases in Escherichia coli, namely Lon, HslVU, ClpXP, ClpAP, and
FtsH, it is the only essential one, and malfunctioning of its human
homolog paraplegin causes a drastic form of hereditary spastic
paraplegia (12, 13). FtsH and its orthologs play a key role in quality
and regulatory control within the cell by degrading a unique subset
of substrates. On the one hand, the protease is able to identify and
degrade nonfunctional or damaged membrane proteins by pulling
them out of the lipid bilayer, followed by further substrate unfolding
and translocation into the proteolytic chamber. On the other hand,
certain cytosolic signaling proteins can be classified as regulatory
control substrates. This group comprises proteins such as the
heat-shock factor ␴32, the lambda phage transcriptional activator
CII (14), and LpxC (15), a key enzyme controlling the amount of
membrane lipopolysaccharides.
The mechanism of AAA⫹ proteases is currently the subject of
intense investigation (reviewed in refs. 3, 4). However, due to the
lack of structural data, there is a considerable gap in our understanding of the way of function. Currently, crystal structures of only
one complete AAA⫹ protease (HslVU) are available, the very first
such structure was the one from E. coli reported by Bochtler et al.
(16), later those from Haemophilus influenzae (17) and another E.
coli structure (18) were published (reviewed in ref. 19). Crystal
structures of constructs spanning most of the cytosolic region, thus
containing AAA and protease domains, of FtsH from Thermotoga
maritima (20) and Thermus thermophilus (21) are also available.
Many other AAA⫹ proteins have been crystallized only in the
monomeric state and 6-fold-symmetric rings have been modeled
frequently (22, 23). Recent biochemical data, however, have demonstrated that at least in some nucleotide states the symmetry has
to be lower, e.g., only maximally 4 ATP molecules bind to 1
hexameric ClpX or PAN or HslU particle (24–26).
A conserved ⌽VG motif (⌽ indicating an aromatic amino
acid) has been identified as mediator between ATP hydrolysis
and substrate unfolding (27–33). The aromatic side chains of this
motif are thought to grab a hydrophobic degradation tag and are
implied to perform a power stroke inward movement, driven by
conformational rearrangements of the AAA⫹ domains.

is shown in red and the AAA ring in magenta and green. Zinc ions are displayed as cyan spheres, the pore residues Phe-234 in yellow space-filling mode. Carbon

Earlier, we have reported the crystal structure of the cytosolic
region of T. maritima FtsH, representing the ADP bound state and
revealing a hexameric molecule composed of 2 rings (20). The
protease ring shows the expected C6 symmetric assembly where the
monomers possess a new fold consisting of 8 ␣-helices and a short
2-stranded antiparallel ␤-ribbon. Surprisingly, the AAA ring exhibited C2 symmetry only, leading to a model of protein unfolding
and translocation where some of the crucial aromatic pore residues
(Phe-234) move inwards. An alternative structure of a glycinemutant of FtsH from T. thermophilus was published later, revealing
a C3-symmetric AAA ring (21), suggesting a pair-wise mechanism
of substrate translocation.
To gain more insight into the ATPase cycle and the unfolding
and translocation mechanism, high-resolution structures of different nucleotide states are needed. Therefore, we have crystallized the apo-state and report the results here. The new
structure reveals the large conformational rearrangements and
pore residue movements necessary for protein unfolding and
translocation and uncovers an active-site switch that is important
for substrate fixation.
Results
The apo-Form of (⌬tm)FtsH Is a C6 Symmetrical Hexamer. To obtain

nucleotide-free (⌬tm)FtsH, we mutated the lysine in the Walker
A motif to alanine (K207A). This mutation prevents nucleotide
binding (2). The mutant crystallizes in spacegroup P622 with 3
monomers per asymmetric unit. Molecular replacement calculations failed to reveal the positions of the AAA domains,
therefore, the structure was solved by selenomethionine single
wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD). Nineteen out of 27
seleniums were found, 6 of them in the 3 proteolytic domains (2
methionines each), the others belong to the AAA domains (Fig.
S1). The resulting experimental electron density map allowed
placement of all proteolytic and AAA domains. The latter have
weaker density (Fig. S2), but the localization and arrangement
is unambiguous.
The 3 monomers in the asymmetric unit belong to 2 hexameric
particles, which are placed on the 6-fold and the 3-fold crystal21580 兩 www.pnas.org兾cgi兾doi兾10.1073兾pnas.0910708106

lographic axes. Both hexamers show no significant deviations
from each other, i.e., both possess perfect 6-fold symmetry in
both the AAA and the protease ring (Fig. 1). While the protease
ring in the apo- and ADP-bound structures is essentially the
same, very large conformational rearrangements can be observed within the AAA-ring. The transition from the ADP to the
apo-form involves changes in the inter-domain angle between
protease and AAA moieties by some 40 to 60° (Fig. 2), thus
causing movements of the conserved pore residues Phe-234 of
the FGV pore motif of more than 45 Å (Fig. 2 A). These
rearrangements of the AAA domains are largely of rigid body
nature. A smaller movement takes place within the individual
AAA domains itself. Due to the loss of the nucleotide, the angle
between N-terminal ‘‘wedge’’ subdomain and C-terminal helical
subdomain increases by about 20° (Fig. 2B). This change concurs
with earlier studies (7, 34). This more open conformation of the
AAA domain is incompatible with the C2-symmetric packing
observed in the ADP-bound state.
An Active-Site Switch Formed by a Substrate-Binding ␤ Strand. A

striking feature of all FtsH structures published so far is the small
amount of ␤ structure in the protease domain. The edge strands of
␤ sheets in endo-proteinases, especially in zincins with their
HEXXH motif that is also present in FtsH, are usually used for
fixing the substrate polypeptide chain in an extended conformation
around the scissile peptide bond by binding the substrate as an
additional antiparallel ␤-strand to these edges. In the apo-form of
FtsH described here, the stretch comprising amino acids 450 to 460
complements the short 2-stranded ␤-ribbon already present in the
ADP form by an additional antiparallel strand. This segment is
disordered in 4 of the 6 independent monomers of the ADP state,
and an ␣-helical conformation is observed in the remaining 2 (Fig.
2C). The cocrystallized hydroxamic acid inhibitor TAPI binds in
an extended parallel conformation to this newly formed edge
strand (Fig. 2 C and D). The formation of this edge strand is
independent of the presence of inhibitors or substrates, because it
is also observed in crystals of the K207A mutant obtained in the
Bieniossek et al.

absence of these (e.g., the selenium-labeled crystal use for structure
determination).
The G404L Mutant Is Monomeric and Inactive. To improve crystal

quality by restricting conformational flexibility, Suno and coworkers mutated a glycine residue (G399 in T. thermophilus) in the linker
between AAA and protease domain to leucine (21). This glycine is
completely conserved among all FtsH homologs (Fig. S3). To
examine the effects of this mutation more closely, we introduced the

same mutation in T. maritima FtsH, replacing Gly-404 by a leucine.
Contrary to the wild type, this mutant elutes exclusively as a
monomer from the gel filtration column (Fig. 3C). Activity measurements show that the T. maritima G404L mutant is inactive in
the ATPase assay and possesses only very low proteolytic activity
(Fig. 3 A and B).

translocate their substrates into the proteolytic chambers is cur-

rently a topic of intense discussion. A gap in structural information
has been a hindrance to achieve a deeper understanding. The 2
crystal structures of T. maritima FtsH in its ADP- and apo-state
provide a basis for the movements occurring between the different
nucleotide states. The protease ring is the stationary component
and nucleotide-driven movements of the AAA domains accomplish
substrate unfolding and translocation by pulling the polypeptide
chain against and through the central pore. The 2 structures
available now illuminate the transition from the ADP- to the
apo-state. The ATP-loaded hexamer might look roughly similar as
the nucleotide-free, but is presumably not 6-fold symmetric anymore, because it is unlikely that 6 ATP bind simultaneously and
ATPs are bound with different affinities (24–26). Furthermore, the
nucleotide induced subdomain closure within the AAA moiety
would lead to a more compact, closed appearance. However, the
location of the pore residues could still be similar to the apo-state
and the inward movement of 4 of the 6 phenylalanines, as seen in
the ADP-bound conformation (Fig. 4) (20), describes the actual

‘‘pulling’’ on the substrate polypeptide chain. The currently most
accepted hypothesis is that the energy-stroke of ATP hydrolysis is
converted into a mechanical force by conformational changes
involving the pore residues. Atomic force microscopy experiments
show that typically a force of a few hundred pico-Newtons (pN) is
needed to unfold many proteins. Estimating the energy of ATP
hydrolysis under cellular conditions as 45 kJ/mol, a movement of 50
Å can generate a force of about 150 pN. While some cryo-EM
reconstructions of different nucleotide states can be interpreted in
this way, x-ray structures have failed so far to demonstrate conformational changes in this order of magnitude. The structure presented here reveals for the first time nucleotide-dependent changes
in this order of magnitude (see Movie S1), whereby hydrolysis does
not take place simultaneously in all subunits (24, 35). Our model is
in agreement with the 1:1 enzyme:substrate stoichiometry that has
been observed in at least 2 examples of AAA⫹ proteins (24, 25).
On the other hand, the proposed alternative model (21) would
principally allow the simultaneous binding of 3 substrate molecules.

BIOCHEMISTRY

We could also provide evidence here that the low-resolution model
proposed by Suno et al. (21) suffers from an underlying nonconservative mutation that, at least for T. maritima FtsH, inactivates the
protein.
The structure of apo-FtsH presented here together with the
fully ADP-loaded structure presented earlier (20) provides for
the first time a high-resolution image of the movement of the
crucial pore residues. We propose that this mechanism is universal for all AAA⫹ proteins—substrate processing is achieved
by pulling it through the central pore.
