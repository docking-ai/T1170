Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is transmitted to humans through
mosquitoes and causes Chikungunya fever. Nonstructural protein
2 (nsP2) exhibits the protease and RNA helicase activities that are
required for viral RNA replication and transcription. Unlike for the
C-terminal protease, the structure of the N-terminal RNA helicase
(nsP2h) has not been determined. Here, we report the crystal
structure of the nsP2h bound to the conserved 3′-end 14 nucleotides of the CHIKV genome and the nonhydrolyzable transitionstate nucleotide analog ADP-AlF4. Overall, the structural analysis
revealed that nsP2h adopts a uniquely folded N-terminal domain
followed by a superfamily 1 RNA helicase fold. The conserved helicase motifs establish polar contacts with the RNA backbone. There
are three hydrophobic residues (Y161, F164, and F287) which form
stacking interactions with RNA bases and thereby bend the RNA
backbone. An F287A substitution that disrupted these stacking
interactions increased the basal ATPase activity but decreased
the RNA binding affinity. Furthermore, the F287A substitution reduced viral infectivity by attenuating subgenomic RNA synthesis.
Replication of the mutant virus was restored by pseudoreversion
(A287V) or adaptive mutations in the RecA2 helicase domain
(T358S or V410I). Y161A and/or F164A substitutions, which were
designed to disrupt the interactions with the RNA molecule, did
not affect the ATPase activity but completely abolished the replication and transcription of viral RNA and the infectivity of CHIKV.
Our study sheds light on the roles of the RNA helicase region in
viral replication and provides insights that might be applicable to
alphaviruses and other RNA viruses in general.

triphosphatase (NTPase) and RNA triphosphatase activities and a
cysteine protease at the C-terminal region that is responsible for
polyprotein processing (7, 8); nsP3 shows ADP ribosyl-binding and
hydrolase activities and is used for the initiation of viral genome
replication (9, 10); and nsP4 exhibits RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity (11, 12). These nsPs together with host factors
form replication complexes (RCs) that catalyze the synthesis of a
negative-sense (−) antigenome and subsequently new genomic
and subgenomic (SG) RNAs (13). The SG RNA serves as the
mRNA for structural proteins, capsid, and glycoproteins (E1, E2,
and E3) required for progeny virus assembly (14).
The CHIKV nsP2 plays a vital role in viral infection. In infected cells, the majority of the alphavirus nsP2 proteins are not
bound to RCs located at the cell membranes but rather widely
distributed between the cytoplasm and nucleus (15). The distribution of nsP2 in the nucleus inhibits antiviral signaling by
hijacking the host’s cellular transcriptional machinery and inducing cytopathic effects in vertebrate cells (16–18). As the
largest alphavirus protein, nsP2 has multiple functional domains.
Specifically, the CHIKV nsP2 possesses 5′–3′ RNA helicase and
RNA annealing activities (8), and the C-terminal region (amino
acids 471–798) has protease and methyltransferase-like (MTL)
Significance
The multifunctional helicase-protease protein nsP2 of
Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) plays vital roles in viral RNA replication and virus–host interactions. We determined the crystal
structure of the helicase part of the CHIKV nsP2 (nsP2h) bound
to the conserved 3′ end of the genomic RNA and the nucleotide
analog ADP-AlF4. The structure of this ternary complex revealed
the molecular basis for viral RNA recognition and ATP hydrolysis
by the nsP2h. Unique hydrophobic protein–RNA interactions
play essential roles in viral RNA replication. These findings expand our knowledge of CHIKV and related alphaviruses and
might also have broad implications for antiviral and vaccine
developments against pathogenic alphaviruses.

hikungunya virus (CHIKV) causes acute febrile illness
termed Chikungunya fever, which often leads to painful and
long-lasting arthritic sequelae (1–4). CHIKV belongs to the genus
Alphavirus, which includes many human pathogens. “Old World”
alphaviruses, including CHIKV, o’nyong’nyong virus, Sindbis virus
(SINV), and Semliki Forest virus (SFV), usually cause rashes and
arthritis, and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus and Eastern
equine encephalitis virus are “New World” alphaviruses and tend
to cause encephalitis. These pathogenic alphaviruses have spread
to many countries and have affected many millions of people
worldwide, and unfortunately there are currently no vaccines or
specific antiviral drugs for the prevention or treatment of any
human infections caused by alphaviruses, including CHIKV.
CHIKV has a 12-kb positive-sense RNA (+ssRNA) genome
containing a 5′-methylguanylate cap, a 3′-polyadenylated tail, and
two ORFs. The first ORF is translated into precursors of four
nonstructural proteins (nsPs) and the P1234 and P123 polyproteins. Both P123 and mature individual nsPs are involved in
viral RNA replication and transcription. Each nsP has its own
distinct enzymatic and nonenzymatic functions as follows: nsP1
displays the methyl- and guanylyltransferase activities required for
cap synthesis and plasma membrane-anchoring ability (5, 6);
nsP2 contains an N-terminal RNA helicase with both nucleotide

Results
Overall Structure of the Ternary Complex nsP2h-RNA14-ADP-AlF4. To

better understand the multiple functions of the CHIKV nsP2
N-terminal helicase, we determined the crystal structure of nsP2h
(amino acid residues 1–465 of nsP2) in complex with a 14-mer
ssRNA (RNA14; 5′-GUUUUUAAUAUUUC-3′) and a nonhydrolyzable transition-state nucleotide analog, ADP-AlF4,
which we designated as the nsP2h-RNA14-ADP-AlF4 ternary
complex (Fig. 1, SI Appendix, Fig. S1, and Movie S1). The
structure was determined by multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) using selenomethionine (SeMet)-labeled nsP2h
proteins. The crystal structure was then refined with a native
dataset to a resolution of 2.00 Å (SI Appendix, Table S1). Briefly,
two nsP2h molecules were built in the asymmetric unit (one from
residues 1–463 and the other from residues 1–464) with only nine
missing internal surface residues: residues 56–64 in the first
nsP2h molecule and residues 55–63 in the second nsP2h molecule. The nsP2h-RNA14-ADP-AlF4 complex was refined to obtain a good-quality structure with Rwork and Rfree values of 17.7%
and 21.5%, respectively (SI Appendix, Table S1 and Movie S1).
The final model includes seven ribonucleotide residues of
RNA14 (residues 2–8, 5′-UUUUUAA-’3), an additional phosphate of the ninth ribonucleotide residue, and the transitionstate nucleotide analog ADP-AlF4 (Fig. 1 B and C).
The nsP2h structure is composed of multiple domains, including a small but uniquely folded N-terminal domain (NTD),
the SF1 familiar accessory domains 1B and the Stalk α-helix, the
two similar and parallel Rec-A-like domains (designated
RecA1 and RecA2 domains), and an extended α-helical connector (Fig. 1). The NTD-Stalk-1B formed a top cover for the
ssRNA-binding groove by interacting with both RecA1 and the
3′ half of the bound RNA (Fig. 1 B–D). The nsP2h helicase core
consisted of the RecA1 (green) and RecA2 (cyan) domains, with
RNA-binding motifs lying on top of the two domains and an
ATPase active site between the two domains (Fig. 1 B, C, and F).
Law et al.

Conserved and Unique Modes of RNA Recognition. The crystal
structure revealed a unique mode of RNA recognition by the
nsP2h (Fig. 1 D and E and Movie S2). Similar to the Upf1:
ssRNA complex (28), the U2–A8 nucleotides of RNA14 were
bound in the 5′-to-3′ direction in the central groove of the nsP2h.
The ssRNA interacted with the conserved RNA backbone recognition motifs on top of the helicase core domains, such as Ia,
Ic, III, IIIa, IV, V, and Va (Fig. 1F and SI Appendix, Fig. S2).
K211 located within motif Ia was in contact with phosphates of
U6 and U7 (Fig. 1 D and E). T233, D235, and S236 located within
motif Ic interacted with phosphates and riboses of the last three
ribonucleotides (U6–A8). Notably, W363 and R361 located
within motif IV were in contact with phosphates of the first ribonucleotide (U2) and ribonucleotides U4 and U5, respectively.
T378 from motif V interacted with the phosphate of U5, and
motif V played a role in unwinding duplexes with a 5′-to-3′ polarity (35). N240 located between motifs Ic and II as well as
N400 and H409 located between motifs V and VI showed interactions with the phosphates and riboses of U3, U4, U6, and A7.
Most interestingly, unique stacking interactions were found between the nsP2h and the bound ssRNA. The aromatic side chain
of F287 (motif III) intercalated between RNA bases U4 and U5
and separated the 5′ end of RNA U2–U4, which interacted with
the RecA2 domain, and the 3′end of RNA U5–A8, which interacted with the RecA1 domain (Fig. 1 D and E). The side chains
of Y161 and F164 from domain 1B, which were perpendicular to
each other, formed stacking interactions with the bases of U6 and
A7, respectively, and these interactions introduced a bend in the
bound RNA (Fig. 1 D and E) and disrupted the A-form conformation of the bound RNA (Fig. 1 A and B).
Transition State of ATP Hydrolysis Mimicked by ADP-AlF4. ADP-AlF4

was tightly bound at the ATPase active site between the
RecA1 and RecA2 domains, and the ADP adenine base was held
above the connector (Fig. 1 B and C and Movie S3). In detail, the
side chain e-amino group of K192 (motif I) coordinated the βand γ-phosphate groups directly as well as the α-phosphate group
via a water molecule-mediated hydrogen bond. The presence of
Mg2+ ions in the helicase protein has been shown to be essential
for RNA helicase activity (8). Coherently, the α- and β-phosphate
groups of ADP were coordinated by K192 and S193 within motif I,
R312 within motif IIIa, and divalent metal ion (Mg2+; black
sphere). As shown in Fig. 1F, Mg2+ ions were in contact with β- and
γ-phosphate groups, S193 (motif I), and three water moleculemediated interactions with N213 (motif Ia), D252 (motif II), and
E253 (motif II). The AlF4 mimicked the transition state of the
γ-phosphate group of the nucleotide analog by adopting a tetrahedral bipyramidal configuration with a water molecule above and
an ADP molecule below (Fig. 1F). This transition state was stabilized by extensive polar interactions with K192 (motif I), Q283
(motif III), R312 (motif IIIa), and R416 (motif VI) and by one
water molecule-mediated interaction (E253, motif II). Q283, the
most conserved residue in motif III, acted as a γ-phosphate sensor
and played a role in the coupling of ATP hydrolysis, RNA binding,
and helicase activities. The ADP was located on top of the connector, and its adenine base was sandwiched between R311 (motif
IIIa) and W450 (connector). The connector connected the helicase
region to the protease domain and might have played a role in
closing the ATP binding cleft.
Structural Dynamics of nsP2h upon Binding to RNA and ADP-AlF4. To
investigate how the binding of RNA and ADP-AlF4 affected the
conformational dynamics of nsP2h in solution, we performed a
hydrogen/deuterium exchange MS (HDX-MS) analysis. RNA
binding alone resulted in mild protection, as indicated by a
slightly slower HDX between nsP2h and the solvent, which was
limited to amino acid residues 218–238 (between motif Ia and

domains (19). Although the structures of the C-terminal protease region of alphavirus nsP2 (nsP2p) (20, 21) and uncleaved
P23 precursor protein without the N-terminal helicase part of the
nsP2 (nsP2h) (22) have been determined, the CHIKV nsP2h
structure remains elusive.
The alphavirus nsP2 helicase is categorized into the superfamily 1 (SF1) helicases based on conserved motifs (23). SF1,
which is the largest among the six helicase superfamilies, has a
conserved helicase core that consists of two similar Rec-A-like
domains, which work in parallel as a motor for DNA or RNA
binding and NTP hydrolysis (24). To date, many crystal structures of SF1 helicases originating from different organisms, such
as the bacterial DNA helicases UvrD (25) and PcrA (26), the
eukaryotic RNA helicase Upf1 (27, 28), and the helicases of
RNA viruses such as helicases from the tomato mosaic virus
(ToMV) (29), the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus
(MERS-CoV) (30), and the equine arteritis virus (EAV), have
been resolved (31). However, the structure of the helicase of
ToMV (ToMV-hel) remains the only resolved crystal structure of a
helicase from a virus belonging to the large alphavirus-like superfamily (29, 32). Although CHIKV also belongs to this superfamily,
nsP2h shares less than 20% sequence identity with ToMV-hel.
In this study, we report a ternary complex of the CHIKV
nsP2h bound to a 14-mer ssRNA (RNA14), which contains the
sequence of the 3′ end of the CHIKV genome, and the ATP
analog ADP-AlF4, which is commonly used as a transition-state
analog for ATP hydrolysis in structural biology (33, 34). The
effects of mutations of the amino acid residues interacting with
RNA14 and ADP-AlF4 were analyzed to elucidate the significance of these interactions on the enzymatic function of nsP2h
and on their potential roles in virus RNA replication. Together,
our findings aid the understanding of the alphavirus replication
process and provide valuable information for the development
of antiviral treatments or vaccines against CHIKV and other
pathogenic alphaviruses.

motif Ic) and amino acids 379–391 (between motif V and motif
Va) (Fig. 2A and SI Appendix, Fig. S3A). These results suggested
that RNA binding only triggered local conformational rearrangements in the absence of the nucleotide analog ADP-AlF4.
If both RNA14 and ADP-AlF4 were present, nsP2h exhibited
more conformational changes because all conserved helicase
motifs in both the RecA1 and RecA2 domains were engaged in
ligand binding. Stronger protection against solvent exchange was
observed in the sequences within motifs I, Ia, III, IV, V, Va, and
VI (Fig. 2B and SI Appendix, Fig. S3B). The region (amino
acids184–216) between motif I and motif Ia exhibited protection
against solvent exchange. The greatest protection against deuterium exchange was mapped to the p-loop sequence of motif I
(Fig. 2B and SI Appendix, Fig. S5). In contrast, the sequence
(amino acids 420–460) within the connector was the only region
that showed some increased deuterium incorporation, likely due
to the closed ATP binding cleft. It is also noteworthy that no
significant conformational changes were observed in the Nterminal accessory domains in the ternary complex, including
the NTD, stalk, and domain 1B (Fig. 2B).
To complement the HDX-MS findings, a limited proteolysis
experiment was performed, and the results showed that almost

all apo nsP2h (Fig. 2C; lane 4) and RNA14-bound proteins (lane
5) were digested into smaller fragments by trypsin after incubation for 0.5 h. The resulting digested fragment distributions
suggested that RNA binding had no effect on the stimulation of
nsP2h conformational changes. In contrast, nsP2h was more
resistant to trypsin digestion after incubation for 0.5 h (lane 6)
and 2 h (lane 9) in the presence of both RNA14 and ADP-AlF4.
nsP2h bound to RNA14 and ADP-AlF4 was completely digested
into smaller fragments only after incubation with trypsin for 12 h
(lane 12), which indicated that nsP2h exhibited a more stable
conformational rearrangement after binding to RNA14 and
ADP-AlF4 (Fig. 2C). These findings were also in agreement with
the results from the thermal shift assays. The melting temperature (Tm) of nsP2h increased only by 0.4 °C in the presence of
RNA14 and by 22.1 °C in the presence of both RNA14 and
ADP-AlF4 (Fig. 2D). Taken together, these results demonstrated that the ternary complex nsP2h-RNA14-ADP-AlF4 was
more thermostable and resistant against trypsin digestion and
deuterium exchange compared with apo nsP2h or nsP2h–
RNA14 (Fig. 2 A–D). The bindings of RNA14 and ADP-AlF4
might trigger closed the conformational rearrangements in the

ATP hydrolysis (Fig. 2E).
Dissecting the Coupling of RNA Binding and ATP Hydrolysis by
Mutagenesis. To reveal the functional consequence of the co-

ordinated binding of RNA14 and ADP-AlF4, we performed a
structure-guided mutagenesis study focusing on the stacking interactions and NTP-binding sites. The Y161A or F164A substitution was introduced to weaken the hydrophobic interaction
between RNA and the N-terminal accessory domains of the
helicase core. The obtained mutant proteins largely retained
the WT ATP hydrolysis activity (Fig. 3A), which suggested that
the stacking interactions between the RNA and the helicase
accessory domain 1B have little effect on the NTPase activity of
the helicase core. Subsequently, W450 in the connector, which
establishes the stacking interaction with the ADP adenine base,
was mutated to Ala (W450A). Remarkably, the W450A mutation reduced the nsP2h solubility and yield, which indicated that
W450 in the connector is essential for maintenance of the integrity of the catalytic site (SI Appendix, Fig. S4). Furthermore,
compared with WT nsP2h, the protein with the W450A substitution showed lower catalytic efficiency with a kcat/Km value of
0.12 s−1·μM−1 (Fig. 3A). In sharp contrast, the F287A mutation,
which affected another residue involved in the stacking interactions, doubled the kcat value (ATP molecules hydrolyzed per
second per molecule of nsP2h) of the enzyme. The mutant
protein also showed approximately twofold less effectiveness
with a kcat/Km value of 0.21 s−1·μM−1 and less binding affinity
with a Kd value of 760.0 nM compared with WT nsP2h (Fig. 3 A
and C). Furthermore, we observed a twofold increase in the Kd
values of both nsP2h and nsP2h-F287A in the presence of ADPAlF4. A similar observation has also been reported for the transitionstate analog ADP-AlF4 of the SF1 RNA helicase Upf1 and the SF2
Law et al.

RNA helicase hepatitis C virus NS3 (28, 36). The results suggested
that the RNA conformation trapped in the ternary complex was
restrained by nsP2h upon ATP binding (Fig. 3C). As expected, the
mutations of two well-studied conserved residues related to NTP
binding, K192A within motif I and Q283A within motif III, completely abolished the ATPase activity (37). The changes in the
protein stability of these mutants upon RNA-ADP-AlF4 binding
were also in agreement with the ATP hydrolysis data (SI Appendix,
Fig. S5). Proteins harboring mutations in amino acid residues with
aromatic rings that were involved in the stacking interactions with
RNA (Y161A, F164A, and F287A) responded well and became
significantly stabilized to a level comparable to that of the WT
protein, as demonstrated with an increase of ∼20 to 22 °C in their
Tm values. Due to weakened ATP binding, the proteins with
ATPase site mutations (K192A and Q283A) were stabilized to a
much lesser extent than the WT protein, and their Tm values increased by ∼4 to 5 °C (SI Appendix, Fig. S5).
We subsequently showed that ssRNA exerted little stimulatory
effect on the ATPase activity of the CHIKV nsP2h (Fig. 3B),
which agrees with the results of earlier studies (7, 8). At concentrations of 1 or 2 μM, RNA14 was unable to significantly
stimulate the ATPase activity of WT nsP2h or its mutant F287A,
which confirmed that RNA binding alone did not induce significant conformational changes to the helicase/ATPase (Fig. 3B
and SI Appendix, Fig. S6).
Essential Roles of nsP2h–RNA Interactions on Viral RNA Replication.

(Gluc) reporters was produced using the human RNA polymerase I promoter (pol I-Fluc-Gluc; Fig. 4A). Six individual
residues were mutated to Ala on the CMV-P1234 construct. As
shown in Fig. 4 B and C, the Fluc and Gluc expression levels
(corresponding to the synthesis of full-length and SG RNAs,
respectively) of replicases containing K192A or Q283A mutations did not exceed the background levels. These results were
expected because the catalytic site is critical for NTP hydrolysis
(Fig. 3A) and important for viral replication (37). Interestingly,
the same results were observed for replicases harboring the
Y161A, F164A, or Y161A and F164A substitutions. In contrast,
the ATPase activities of nsP2h-Y161A and nsP2h-F164A were
similar to that of WT nsP2h (Fig. 3A). This finding suggested
that although the stacking interactions were not critical for
ATPase activity they might be needed for helicase activity, and
thus the corresponding residues are critical for both genomic
RNA and SG RNA synthesis. Similarly, no increase in the Fluc
signal was observed in the presence of replicase with the W450A
mutation, and only a minor increase (∼0.1% of that achieved
with the WT replicase) in Gluc activity was detected. Interestingly, the replicase containing the F287A substitution increased the Fluc expression level to levels comparable to those
found with the WT replicase but showed a significantly reduced
ability to increase Gluc expression, which suggested that the
F287 residue might play a specific role in activating the promoter
of SG RNA synthesis (Fig. 4C).
We subsequently evaluated the effects of mutations in templateRNA sequences. For this analysis, U5 and A7 of RNA14, which
9562 | www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1900656116

originate from the 3′ end of the CHIKV genome, were selected
because these are the most active ribonucleotides in terms of interaction with residues of nsP2h (Fig. 1 D and E). The position of
pol I-Fluc-Gluc corresponding to the U5 residue was mutated to
adenine (U5A), or alternatively the position of A7 was mutated to
uracil (A7U). As shown in Fig. 4 D and E, the Fluc and Gluc
expression levels from the RNA corresponding to pol I-Fluc-Gluc
containing the U5A substitution were greatly and significantly
reduced, and no similar effect was detected for the pol I-Fluc-Gluc
containing A7U. U5 exhibits a stacking interaction with F287 (motif
III) and hydrogen bonds with R361 and T378 (motif V; Fig. 1 D and
E), and thus the mutation of U5 might disrupt these interactions.
Taken together, the results showed that the residue corresponding
to U5 of RNA14 was critical for CHIKV RNA replication.
The effects of helicase mutations on the ability of RNA,
transcribed by cellular RNA polymerase II using a plasmid
containing the cDNA of the virus under the CMV promoter, to
initiate replication and infectious virus formation (hereafter
“infectivity of RNA”) were examined through an infectious
center assay (ICA). The results revealed that the infectivity of
RNA of all CHIKV constructs containing the above-listed mutations was below the detection limit (<2 pfu/μg DNA) (Fig. 4F).
For constructs harboring alanine residues at the Y161, F164,
K192, Q283, or W450 positions, this result was expected because
it correlated to the lack of genomic RNA synthesis observed in
the trans-replicase assays (Fig. 4B). The lethal nature of these
substitutions was further confirmed by the lack of infectious virus
progeny and capsid protein expression in transfected cells (Fig. 4

F and G). In agreement with the trans-replicase data, the virus
containing the F287A substitution was rescued, even though it
reached a strongly diminished titer (7.87 × 103 pfu/mL) and
showed reduced synthesis of capsid protein (Fig. 4 F and G). To
resolve the discrepancy between the ICA data and the production of infectious progeny, the genomes of the rescued viruses
were analyzed for reversions, pseudoreversions, and/or occurrences of secondary compensatory mutations. Sequencing of the
2,815-bp region (residues 2,100–4,915 of the CHIKV genome)
covering all nsP2 sequences and flanking regions of nsP1 and
nsP3 from 10 independent clones revealed no potential secondsite adaptive mutations outside of the helicase domain, which
suggested that the compensation was limited within the nsP2h.
One clone out of 10 did not have any mutations with the exception of the original F287A, which indicated that the genome
containing F287A was sufficiently active to be preserved in a
Law et al.

pool of replicating RNAs. However, the A287 residue was clearly
not optimal because nine clones contained pseudoreversions or
adaptive changes. Three clones had some version of pseudoreversion through introduction of the A287-to-Val (A287V) substitution (SI Appendix, Fig. S7A). Although F287A substitution
was preserved in the rest of clones, four of them contained the
V410-to-Ile (V410I) substitution, and remaining clones contained
the T358-to-Ser (T358S) substitution (SI Appendix, Fig. S7 B and
C). Taken together, our data indicated that the F287A mutation
attenuated the infectivity of CHIKV, but the rescued virus possessed adaptive abilities.
To confirm the functional significance of the revealed mutations, these were introduced into both the CMV-P1234 and infectious cDNA constructs harboring the F287A substitution and
assayed as described above. All three substitutions restored the
infectivity of RNA of the infectious clone to a level similar to

that of WT CHIKV (Fig. 4F); the only differences were that the
viruses with the pseudoreversion (Val287 residue) or the F287A+
V410I mutations formed smaller plaques than the WT viruses or
viruses harboring the F287A+T358S substitutions. The effects of
all three mutations on trans-replicase were also nearly identical:
The pseudoreversion and both compensatory changes exerted
minor or no effects on the ability of the mutant trans-replicase to
increase the expression of the Fluc marker, and the ability to increase the expression of Gluc was restored to levels similar to that
of the WT construct (Fig. 4 B and C). These effects were highly
consistent with the nature of the defect caused by the F287A
substitution and demonstrated that the mutant virus restored its
ability to express high levels of SG RNA through pseudoreversion,
which likely increased the hydrophobic properties because Val
does not possess an aromatic ring. Alternatively, and somewhat
more surprisingly, SG RNA synthesis was also rescued by compensatory changes in the RecA2 domain that occurred at residues
located close to the positions involved in RNA binding (SI Appendix, Fig. S7).
Structural Comparison with Other SF1 RNA Helicases. As shown in
Fig. 5, SI Appendix, Fig. S8, and Movie S4, the Dali server
revealed four top hits of SF1 RNA helicases: ToMV-hel [Protein
Data Bank (PDB) ID code 3WRX; Dali Z-score: 27.1], human
Upf1 (PDB ID code 2XZO; Dali Z-score: 20.5), MERS-CoV
nsp13 (PDB ID code 5WWP; Dali Z-score: 19.8), and EAV
nsp10 (PDB ID code 4N0N; Dali Z-score: 18.2) (39). The conserved RNA helicase domain arrangements of these top hits of
SF1 RNA helicases shared slightly higher similarity to nsP2h
(Fig. 5A), but their accessory domains were quite different. The
structure of ToMV-hel (Fig. 5B) bound to a nucleotide analog
was the most similar to that of nsP2h. Because the structure was
not bound to RNA, the interaction and structural conformation
between RNA and ToMV-hel are unknown. The human Upf1
(Fig. 5C) and EAV nsp10 (SI Appendix, Fig. S8B) were bound to
ssRNA and ssDNA, respectively, on top of the helicase core
domains, and these interactions were mediated by accessory domains, similarly to the findings obtained for nsP2h. However, the
majority of contacts in ssRNA-Upf1 or ssDNA-EAV nsp10 were
only made through backbone phosphates and nonspecific protein–
base interactions. Unlike Upf1 and EAV nsp10, the RNA–nsP2h
interface consisted of three additional stacking interactions between nsP2h and the ssRNA between conserved hydrophobic
residues from the N-terminal region of the helicase and RNA
bases. Furthermore, in contrast to the nsP2h, none of the top hit
RNA helicases contained an extended α-helical connector close to
the catalytic site. The W450 in the connector, the adenine base of
ADP, and R311 in motif IIIa formed stacking interactions (Fig. 1 B
and C). As shown above, disruptions of any stacking interactions
and residues in the connector affected the ability of nsP2 to support viral RNA replication (Figs. 3 and 4), which suggested that the
stacking interactions and the connector are critical for the replication of CHIKV. Taken together, the results from the structural
comparison of nsP2h with similar SF1 helicases further support the
assertion that the RNA recognition mode of nsP2h is unique.

Discussion
The CHIKV nsP2 plays multiple biological roles that are essential for viral replication and interaction with the host, but
there is no available structural information for its N-terminal
region. In this study, we determined the crystal structure of
CHIKV nsP2h bound to the conserved 3′ end of genomic RNA
(RNA14) with the sequence 5′-GUUUUUAAUAUUUC-3′ and
ADP-AlF4, which is the transition-state analog of ATP hydrolysis. This crystal structure of the alphavirus nsP2 helicase region
contains the NTD, the domain 1B, the stalk, the RecA1 domain,
the RecA2 domain, and the connector (Fig. 1A). The accessory
NTD and the connector are relatively small but uniquely wrapped
around the conserved helicase core. The RNA14 and ADP-AlF4
collaboratively stabilized the helicase region by modulating conformational rearrangements of the nsP2h. We observed unique
9564 | www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1900656116

hydrophobic stacking interactions between the nsP2h and the
RNA and proved that these interactions were essential for viral
replication through a structure-guided mutagenesis analysis.
The published evidence suggests that the functionality of
nsP2 depends on the precise sequence of its NTD. Here, we
showed that the extreme end of the NTD (amino acids 1–14)
adopted an ordered hairpin structure (SI Appendix, Fig. S9) after
cleavage between the nsP1 and nsP2 of CHIKV (RP4AP3GP2AP1↓
GP1′IP2 ′IP3′EP4′) (40). Previous studies have indicated that the
insertion of GFP between residues 8 and 11 of the SINV nsP2
(41) and the substitutions of residues 3–7 of the SFV nsP2 (40)
affect ns-polyprotein processing and RNA infectivity. Moreover,
the CHIKV nsP2 without the NTD lacks NTPase activity (8),
which further supports possibility that disruption of the hydrogen
interaction of the hairpin loop and deletion of the NTD affect
the functionality of alphavirus nsP2 proteins. As shown in the
nsP2h structure, the NTD was not directly involved in RNA14
binding and might be involved in the recognition of other viral
proteins or protein junctions. Based on this activity, the NTD
helps nsP2 regulate ns-polyprotein processing and coordinate the
viral RNA replication process (19, 40). Domain 1B, which is an
accessory domain, was previously described as a human Upf1
protein (27). However, according to the Dali server, the structure
of Upf1, a well-studied SF1 helicase, shares only a low level of
structural similarity with nsP2h, as shown in Fig. 5. Upf1 consists
of an N-terminal cysteine-histidine–rich domain, a domain 1B
connected to RecA1 by two α-helices, and an α-helix denoted as

N-terminal helicase and C-terminal protease regions did not
significantly affect viral replication (38), which suggested that the
two domains were connected with a flexible linker that gives the
domain a notable level of freedom to move relative to each other.
Thus, it would not be surprising if RNA–full-length nsP2 has a
distinct and stable conformational arrangement. Therefore, further investigations are needed to study the structure of RNA–fulllength nsP2 and the functional cross-talk within domains. In addition, similar to the studies on SINV uncleaved P23 precursor
protein without nsP2h (22), there will be considerable interest to
resolve the structure of uncleaved P23 of CHIKV, and such
studies will provide essential information about the functioning of
the replicase proteins in their precleavage forms and allow a
deeper understanding of the process of active replicase formation.

Production of Recombinant Proteins. The expression and purification of
proteins of interest were performed as described previously by Phoo et al.
(49). Expression vectors encoding WT and mutant nsP2h were used for the
transformation of Escherichia coli Rosetta 2 (DE3) strain. The bacteria were
cultured at 37 °C in LB supplemented with antibiotics and induced with
1 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside (IPTG) at 18 °C overnight. For
the production of SeMet-labeled CHIKV nsP2h, the E. coli B834 (DE3) cells
were transformed using the expression vector containing the sequence
encoding WT nsP2h, and SeMet-labeled CHIKV-nsP2h was obtained by culturing the obtained cells at 37 °C in SelenoMethionine Medium Complete
(Molecular Dimension) supplemented with antibiotics and methionine
(Molecular Dimension) until the log phase. The bacterial culture was harvested and washed three times with autoclaved distilled water. The washed
bacterial pellet was resuspended in warm SelenoMethionine Medium
Complete supplemented with antibiotics and SeMet (Molecular Dimension),
and the cultures were grown for 1 to 2 h at 37 °C and then induced with
1 mM IPTG at 18 °C overnight. The overnight bacterial cultures were harvested and lysed, and the recombinant protein was purified using HisPur NiNTA Resin (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The eluted proteins were digested with
SUMO protease, and the obtained untagged proteins were further purified
through HiTrap Heparin HP affinity columns (GE Healthcare Life Sciences)
and HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 75 columns (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). All
purified proteins in gel filtration buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl,
5% glycerol, and 2 mM DTT) were finally aliquoted and stored at −80 °C.
Crystallization and Data Collection. The nsP2h complex with a RNA14 (5′GUUUUUAAUAUUUC-3′) at a protein:RNA molar ratio of 1:1.2 and ADP-AlF4
(1.5 mM ADP, 15 mM NaF, and 7.5 mM AlCl3) were added to buffer containing 25 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, and 2 mM DTT. The
protein complex solution was mixed equally with a reservoir solution containing 100 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, and 12% PEG 8000 using the hanging-drop
vapor-diffusion method to obtain a concentration of 3 mg/mL. Rod-shaped
crystals grew within 1 d at 20 °C. The crystals were dehydrated overnight by
soaking in dehydration buffer (100 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, and 20% PEG 8000)
containing 20% glycerol cryoprotectant, picked up using nylon loops
(Hampton Research), flash-frozen in liquid N2, and mounted. The diffraction
intensities of nsP2h-RNA14-ADP-AlF4 and SeMet-labeled nsP2h-RNA14-ADPAlF4 were collected with the Taiwan Proton Source beamline 05A (TPS-05A)
at the National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center. All of the data were
indexed, integrated, and scaled by HKL2000 (50) and XDS (51).
Structure Determination. The structure of the nsP2h complex was determined
using the MAD method (52). AutoSol (PHENIX) and AutoBuild (PHENIX) (53)
were used to calculate the initial phases and for automatic model building,

domain 1C inserted into RecA1. Domain 1B of Upf1 stabilizes
the RNA-binding conformation during the transition state (28).
In the nsP2h-RNA14-ADP-AlF4 structure, domain 1B played a
role in stabilizing the conformational rearrangements of nsP2h in
the presence of RNA (Fig. 2), which aligned with the stacking
interactions found for the Y161 and F164 residues in domain 1B
with RNA14. Although the ATPase activities of the nsP2hY161A and nsP2h-F164A mutants remained intact (Fig. 3A),
the activities of replicases harboring these substitutions were
completely abolished (Fig. 4 B and C). The findings might suggest that the Y161A and F164A mutations in domain 1B might
directly destabilize the alphavirus (+) ssRNA binding that is
essential for negative-sense (−) ssRNA synthesis and thereby
abolish viral RNA replication.
Similar to Y161 and F164 in domain 1B, F287 from motif III
also exhibited stacking interactions with two bases of RNA14.
Although F287 is located within motif III of SF1 helicases, the
residue is strictly conserved as a phenylalanine among alphaviruses, whereas in other SF1 helicases, residues with smaller hydrophobic side chains, such as leucine and valine, are more
common (42). Unlike inactive replicases harboring the Y161A or
F164A substitution, the replicase containing the F287A substitution displayed active genomic RNA synthesis, even though
its ability to perform SG RNA synthesis was strongly (∼30-fold)
reduced. This finding suggested that the F287 residue might play
a specific role in stabilizing the interaction with alphavirus
ssRNA that is essential for the synthesis of SG RNA. Based on
the findings, CHIKV containing the F287A substitution was attenuated and pseudoreverted or accumulated adaptive mutations (Fig. 4F) that increased the ability of its replicase to
synthesize SG RNA and restored the infectivity of the mutant
viral genome. Interestingly, the accumulated adaptive mutations
were only found within the following conserved helicase
SF1 motifs: A287V (pseudoreversion) located within motif III,
T358S located within motif IV, and V410I located near motif VI.
Motifs III, IV, and VI are the important contact sites between
nucleic acids and NTP binding (42), and these mutations might
aid the capture of (−) ssRNA for SG RNA synthesis.
The nsP2 of Old World alphaviruses displays more cytotoxic
properties than nsP2 of New World alphaviruses (43, 44). Point
mutations in the protease region Old World alphavirus nsP2,
such as mutations of the P718 residue and insertion of five amino
acid residues after residue 647 of CHIKV nsP2, reduce viral
replication (45). Such attenuating changes trigger the accumulation of adaptive mutations, which complicates the design of live
attenuated viruses for vaccine production (46, 47). The attenuated CHIKV containing the F287A substitution coupled with an
adaptive mutation (Fig. 4F) might also have the potential to be a
new platform for the development of live attenuated alphavirus
vaccines. In addition, information about the structure of nsP2h
can be used for the construction of additional attenuating
mutations that, similar to very recently described variable
peptide loop mutations in the protease region of CHIKV nsP2
(44), have no negative effect on viral RNA replication. Furthermore, the nsP2h bound to a nucleotide analog significantly
reduced the RNA-binding affinity (Fig. 3C), providing a great
opportunity to design a rational drug for inhibiting or attenuating viral replication. Therefore, these strategies could provide a new therapeutic option for controlling the disease in
the future.
nsP2h with no C-terminal protease region lacks RNA helicase
activity (8). This finding raises a question regarding the roles of
the C-terminal protease in helping the function of the Nterminal helicase part of nsP2. Although the structures of the
N and C termini of CHIKV nsP2 (21) are available, the conformational arrangement of the full-length nsP2 remains elusive.
Because nsP2 is a nonprocessive helicase (8), it is believed that a
more stable nsP2-RNA conformation is needed to modulate
RNA helicase activity. Das et al. (8) suggested that the MTL
domain from the C-terminal part of nsP2 could strengthen
RNA–nsP2 binding. In addition, GFP inserted between the nsP2

respectively. The structures were then determined by molecular replacement
using the initial phases of the nsP2h complex as the search model with
Phaser-MR (PHENIX) (53). All constructed models were refined using Coot
(54) and phenix.refine (PHENIX) (53).
Hydrogen/Deuterium Exchange. This method was previously described by
Zheng et al. (55). For HDX-MS analysis, an nsP2h protein solution with a
concentration of 10 μM was mixed with RNA14 (5′-GUUUUUAAUAUUUC-3′)
at a protein:RNA molar ratio of 1:1.2 with or without ADP-AlF4 (1.5 mM ADP,
15 mM NaF, and 7.5 mM AlCl3) in HDX H2O buffer containing 25 mM Hepes,
pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, and 2 mM DTT. The mixtures were incubated for 1 h at
4 °C to reach the equilibrium states and then subjected to HDX analysis. All
of the sample handling and peptide separation procedures were performed
at 4 °C. One differential HDX reaction contained 5 μL of nsP2h-RNA14 or
nsP2h-RNA14-ADP-AlF4 and 20 μL of D2O-containing HDX buffer. The reaction was incubated at 4 °C for different time points (0, 10, 30, 60, 300, 900,
or 3,600 s), and the complexes were then quenched by mixing with 25 μL of
ice-cold solution containing 4 M guanidine HCl and 1% trifluoroacetic acid.
Upon injection, the samples were passed through an immobilized pepsin
column (2 mm × 2 cm) at 200 μL·min−1, and the digested peptides were
captured on a 2-mm × 1-cm C8 trap column (Agilent) and desalted. The
peptides were separated across a 2.1-mm × 5-cm C18 column (1.9-μm Hypersil
Gold; Thermo Fisher) with a linear gradient of 4 to 40% CH3CN and 0.3%
formic acid over 5 min. The sample handling, protein digestion, and peptide
separation procedures were conducted at 4 °C. Mass spectrometric data
were acquired using an Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Q Exactive; Thermo
Fisher) with a measured resolving power of 65,000 at m/z 400. The HDX
analyses were performed in triplicate using single preparations of each
protein–ligand complex. The intensity-weighted mean m/z centroid value of
each peptide envelope was calculated and subsequently converted into a
percentage of deuterium incorporation. Corrections for back-exchange were
made based on an estimated deuterium recovery of 70% and accounting for
the known 80% deuterium content of the deuterium exchange buffer.
When comparing the two samples, the perturbation % D was determined by
calculating the difference between the two samples. HDX Workbench colors
each peptide according to the smooth color gradient HDX perturbation key
(% D) shown in each indicated figure. The differences in % D ranging from
−5 to 5% are considered nonsignificant and are colored in gray according to
the HDX perturbation key (56). In addition, unpaired Student’s t tests were
used to reveal the statistically significant (P < 0.05) differences between
samples at each time point. One time point with a P value less than 0.05 was
present for each peptide in the dataset, further confirming that the difference was significant. For data rendering, the HDX data from all overlapping
peptides were consolidated to individual amino acid values using a residue
averaging approach. Briefly, for each residue, the deuterium incorporation
values and peptide lengths from all overlapping peptides were assembled. A
weighting function that gave shorter and longer peptides a heavier or lesser
weight, respectively, was applied. Each of the weighted deuterium incorporation values was then averaged to produce a single value for each
amino acid. The initial two residues of each peptide, as well as prolines, were
omitted from the calculations. This approach is similar to that previously
described (57).
Limited Proteolysis Study. Each reaction mixture contained 20 μM nsP2h in
assay buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, and 2 mM
DTT). The reactions were performed in the presence and absence of 30 μM
RNA14 and ADP-AlF4 (1.5 mM ADP, 15 mM NaF, and 7.5 mM AlCl3) at room
temperature for 0, 0.5, 2, and 12 h. The reaction was terminated by the
addition of Laemmli sample buffer (100 mM Tris·HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20%
glycerol, 200 mM DTT, and 0.2% bromophenol blue), and the reaction
products were analyzed by SDS/PAGE.

ADP-AlF4 were diluted using assay buffer (25 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mM
NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 50 mM TCEP, pH 7.5, and 0.01% Triton X-100), and nsP2h
and nsP2h-F287A were diluted in assay buffer to obtain a series of 14 concentrations. The FP experiment was performed in a 384-well plate (Greiner).
A total volume of 30 μL contained 0 to 2,000 nM protein and 5 nM FAMRNA14. The reaction was performed in the presence or absence of ADPAlF4 (1.5 mM ADP, 15 mM NaF, and 7.5 mM AlCl3) and equilibrated at
room temperature for 20 min. The FP was measured with excitation and
emission wavelengths of 485 nm and 510 nm, respectively, using a Synergy H1 plate reader (BioTek). The FP values are reported in millipolarization units and were analyzed using nonlinear regression with
Prism 7 (GraphPad).
NADH Coupled ATPase Activity Assay. The method previously described by Luo
et al. (58) was used. The assay was performed in a 96-well half-area clear flatbottom microplate (Corning). Each reaction contained 2.5 nM protein of
interest, 1 μM RNA14, and coupled assay mix (1 mM NADH, 100 U/mL lactic
dehydrogenase, 500 U/mL pyruvate kinase, and 2.5 mM phosphoenolpyruvic
acid) which was diluted in ATPase assay buffer (25 mM MOPS, pH 7.4,
150 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM DTT, and 0.01% Triton X-100). The reaction mixture was incubated for 1 to 2 h at room temperature before the
addition of ATP. For determination of the kinetic constants, all of the
components were fixed, with the exception of the amount of ATP, which
was varied. The activity of the proteins was assayed spectrophotometrically
at 340 nM using a Tecan Spark 10M microplate reader (Tecan).
Virus Rescue and Analysis. Virus rescue in BHK-21 cells was performed as
previously described (59). An ICA was performed as previously described (45)
with the exception that the cells were transfected with 5 μg of endotoxinfree plasmids CMV-ICRES1 and its mutant containing the Y161A, F164A,
Y161A+F164A, K192A, Q283A, F287A, W450A, F287V, F287A+V410I, and
F287A+T358S substitutions. The virus stocks of WT CHIKV and the mutant
CHIKV variants were collected at 24 h posttransfection and at 48 h posttransfection, respectively. The obtained stocks were clarified by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 10 min, and the virus titers were determined by plaque
titration on BHK-21 cells. All of the assays were repeated three times. The
presence of reversions or secondary compensatory changes was verified as
previously described (40).
Analysis of CHIKV Replicase Activity in Cell Culture. The CHIKV trans-replicase
assay was performed as described previously (38). Briefly, U2OS cells grown
on 12-well plates were cotransfected with 1 μg of pol I-Fluc-Gluc (or its
mutants) and 1 μg of CMV-P1234 (or its mutant variants) using Lipofectamine LTX (Thermo Fisher Scientific) reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The transfected cells were incubated at 37 °C for 18 h.
Subsequently, 4 × 105 transfected cells were lysed in 250 μL of lysis buffer
(Promega), and 4 μL of lysate corresponding to 6,400 transfected cells was
used for the measurement of Fluc and Gluc activities using the DualLuciferase-Reporter assay and a GloMax SIS luminometer (Promega). The
control cells were transfected with pol I-Fluc-Gluc plasmid and CMVP1234GAA control plasmid that encodes an inactive CHIKV replicase (due to
a mutation in the nsP4 catalytic site). All Fluc and Gluc activities measured
from the experimental cells were normalized to these obtained for the
control cells to reveal whether and to what extent the WT or mutant replicases were able to activate the expression of the reporter, which served as
proxy for positive-strand RNA synthesis by the analyzed replicases. All of the
assays were repeated at least three times.

Fluorescence-Based Thermal Shift Assay. Each reaction contained 5 μM protein, 6 μM RNA14, and 20× SYPRO Orange (Invitrogen) in assay buffer
(20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, and 2 mM DTT). The
reaction mixture was transferred to a High-Profile 96-well PCR plate (BioRad). After the PCR plate was sealed with MicroSeal ’B’ PCR plate sealing film
(Bio-Rad), thermal scanning was performed from 25 °C to 95 °C at an increment rate of 1 °C per 10 s using a CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection
System (Bio-Rad) with the SYBR excitation/emission wavelengths of 492/
517 nm. The fluorescence intensity was recorded at 10-s intervals. The curve
fitting and Tm data were analyzed using Prism 7 (GraphPad).

Western Blotting. Cells transfected with WT icDNA or icDNA plasmids harboring the Y161A, F164A, Y161A+F164A, K192A, Q283A, F287A, or W450A
substitutions were collected at the same time as the corresponding virus
stocks. Briefly, the infected cells were washed with 1 mL of PBS, lysed with
Laemmli sample buffer, and then boiled for 10 min. Lysate corresponding to
50,000 transfected cells was loaded into a well of a 10% polyacrylamide gel.
The proteins were separated by SDS/PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene
difluoride membranes, and detected using antibodies against CHIKV capsid
protein (in-house), and the detection of β-actin (sc-47778; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used as a loading control. The membranes were then incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated to fluorescent
labels (LI-COR), and the proteins were visualized using the LI-COR Odyssey Fc
imaging system.

RNA-Binding Assay. The method previously described by Chen et al. (11) was
used. The 5′-end fluorescein (FAM)-labeled RNA14 (FAM-RNA14; GenScript)
