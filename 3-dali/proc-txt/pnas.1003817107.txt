The segregation of plasmid DNA typically requires three elements:
a DNA centromere site, an NTPase, and a centromere-binding
protein. Because of their simplicity, plasmid partition systems
represent tractable models to study the molecular basis of DNA
segregation. Unlike eukaryotes, which utilize the GTPase tubulin
to segregate DNA, the most common plasmid-encoded NTPases
contain Walker-box and actin-like folds. Recently, a plasmid stability cassette on Bacillus thuringiensis pBtoxis encoding a putative
FtsZ/tubulin-like NTPase called TubZ and DNA-binding protein
called TubR has been described. How these proteins collaborate
to impart plasmid stability, however, is unknown. Here we show
that the TubR structure consists of an intertwined dimer with a
winged helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif. Strikingly, however, the TubR
recognition helices mediate dimerization, making canonical HTH–
DNA interactions impossible. Mutagenesis data indicate that a
basic patch, encompassing the two wing regions and the N termini
of the recognition helices, mediates DNA binding, which indicates
an unusual HTH–DNA interaction mode in which the N termini of
the recognition helices insert into a single DNA groove and the
wings into adjacent DNA grooves. The TubZ structure shows that
it is as similar structurally to eukaryotic tubulin as it is to bacterial
FtsZ. TubZ forms polymers with guanine nucleotide-binding
characteristics and polymer dynamics similar to tubulin. Finally,
we show that the exposed TubZ C-terminal region interacts with
TubR-DNA, linking the TubR-bound pBtoxis to TubZ polymerization.
The combined data suggest a mechanism for TubZ-polymer powered plasmid movement.

deviant Walker A-type ATPase folds, whereas type II systems utilize actin-like NTPases. Interestingly, both types of NTPases form
polymers in NTP-dependent manners that are implicated to play
a role in plasmid DNA separation (16–19). The recent discovery
of TubZ NTPases has led to the designation of “type III” par systems (13, 14). The best studied of these systems is that found on
the pBtoxis plasmid in B. thuringiensis. This plasmid stability system is represented by an operon encoding two proteins: ORF156
(TubZ) and ORF157 (TubR) (7–9, 11). TubR is a 11.6 kDa DNAbinding protein that shows no sequence homology to any known
protein. Studies showed that TubR binds a 48-bp centromere containing four repeat sites in the pBtoxis plasmid and also autoregulates tubRZ transcription (8, 9). TubZ is a 54.4 kDa protein that
can assemble into filaments in a GTP-dependent manner (12).
Both proteins were found to be required for plasmid stability
(9). However, how the TubR and TubZ proteins work together
to effect pBtoxis plasmid segregation is not known. To gain insight
into the molecular mechanism utilized by these proteins in DNA
segregation, we carried out structural and biochemical studies on
the pBtoxis TubR and TubZ proteins. The TubR structure reveals
that it employs a helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif in a previously undescribed manner to bind DNA. TubZ contains a tubulin/FtsZ
fold but has structural distinctions from these proteins indicating
that it forms distinct protofilaments. TubR binds the flexible
C-terminal region of TubZ, thus attaching the TubZ filament
to the pBtoxis plasmid, providing a mechanism for plasmid movement and, ultimately, segregation.

Overall Structure of pBtoxis TubR. The crystal structure of the 107-

he cytoskeletons of eukaryotic cells are constructed of three
primary elements: actin, tubulin, and intermediate filaments.
Although it had long been presumed that the proteins forming
these elements were absent in prokaryotes, it is now known that
prokaryotes contain structural homologs to all three components.
These prokaryotic proteins appear to carry out distinct functions
compared to their eukaryotic counterparts; however, their roles
are similar enough to indicate a likely common ancestor. The best
known prokaryotic homolog of tubulin is FtsZ. Both FtsZ and
tubulin form long filamentous structures by head to tail association in a manner regulated by GTP, which binds between adjacent
subunits (1–4). However, unlike tubulin, FtsZ does not function
in DNA segregation but rather cell division. Specifically, it forms
a cytokinetic ring called the Z ring at midcell, which mediates
septation (5, 6). Recently, however, prokaryotic proteins encoded
on large plasmids harbored in bacilli showing 15–20% sequence
similarity to both FtsZ and tubulin have been identified and
dubbed TubZ (7–12). Studies showed that the Bacillus thuringiensis TubZ protein from the pBtoxis plasmid is essential for plasmid
DNA segregation.
DNA segregation of most low copy number plasmids is carried
out by specific partition (par) systems. These systems require only
three elements: a centromere DNA site, a centromere-binding
protein, and a partition NTPase (13, 14). Partition systems have
been classified into two main types on the basis of the kind
of NTPase present (15). Type I systems contain NTPases with

β2 and β3, the wing. Indeed, each TubR subunit shows the strongest structural similarity to members of the ArsR family of
prokaryotic winged helix transcription regulators, in particular
the Staphylococcus aureus CzrA protein (21, 22). Superposition
of one subunit of TubR onto that of CzrA results in a rmsd of
2.7 Å. This similarity includes the core regions of the winged
HTH, because the loops and N-terminal regions of the proteins
are structurally distinct. For example, TubR contains a β-strand in
its N-terminal region compared to a long helix in the CzrA structure (Fig. 1B). This structural similarity initially suggested that
TubR may be a member of the ArsR family of proteins. However,
the arrangement of the TubR dimer was found to be strikingly
different from the dimer organization exhibited by the ArsR
proteins (Fig. 1C).
ArsR family members are involved in metal-regulated transcription processes whereby they act as repressors in their apo
forms and are induced off their DNA sites upon metal binding
(22). The specific dimer structures of the ArsR proteins are critical for creation of their metal-binding motifs. Not only does
TubR form a very different dimer from the ArsR proteins, it also
does not harbor any of their metal-binding signatures nor does it
contain any other characterized metal-binding motif. Consistent
with this, we find that the addition of metals has no effect on TubR
DNA binding. Dimerization of the ArsR proteins is imparted by
residues from the N-terminal regions, α1 and α5, which, importantly, leaves its recognition helices exposed for DNA interaction
(22). By contrast, the TubR dimer is formed primarily by contacts
between its twofold related “recognition helices” α4 and α4·. This
interaction results in a near complete burial of these helices, leaving only the N-terminal residues exposed to solvent. Whereas the
α4 and α4· interaction creates the dimer core, the dimer is further
stabilized by interactions between the twofold related β1 strands,
which swap to form an antiparallel β-sheet. Residues from α1 and
α5 interact with β1 to further seal the top of the dimer. The dimer
interface formed by these interactions is predominantly hydrophobic and buries a large 1;200 Å2 of subunit surface from solvent.
TubR Forms a “Recognition Helix Dimer”: Implications for DNA Binding. Gel filtration studies on TubR confirmed that it is a dimer in

solution. However, the finding from the structure that the TubR
α4 recognition helices are buried in the dimer core has important
implications in terms of its DNA-binding mechanism. Indeed, it
suggests that, although TubR contains a structurally canonical
HTH, it is not utilized for DNA binding in a manner typical
of HTH proteins. A second crystal form (I222) of TubR, which
was solved to 2.5-Å resolution, revealed the same TubR dimer.
The presence of the identical dimer in two different crystal forms
and its large buried surface area supports that the dimer observed
in the crystal structures is physiologically relevant. However, to

test this, we mutated residues within the recognition helices that
the structure indicates are critical for dimerization and assayed
the ability of the mutant proteins to dimerize via gel filtration.
Specifically, we mutated Ser-63 and Ala-67 individually to tryptophan and arginine.
The structure shows that residues occupying positions 63 and
67 must be small and largely hydrophobic to permit the proper
packing of the α4 helices in the dimer (Fig. S1A). Hence, the introduction of the bulky side chain of tryptophan and, in particular, the large as well as charged side chain of arginine would be
predicted to be highly disruptive to dimerization. Gel filtration
analyses on purified mutant proteins clearly showed that the arginine mutants exist primarily as monomers in solution (>80%),
whereas the tryptophan mutants were able to maintain the dimeric state (Fig. 2A and Fig. S1B). However, all mutant proteins
showed reduced or loss of DNA-binding activity as ascertained by
fluorescence polarization (FP) studies, which examined TubR
protein binding to its centromere site (Fig. 2B and Fig. S1 C
and D) (9). The fact that the monomeric mutants were severely
impaired in DNA binding was not surprising. However, the
finding that the tryptophan mutants, which were largely dimeric,
displayed reduced DNA-binding activity suggested that their oligomer structures might be altered. To address this issue, the structure of S63W TubR was solved to 2.8-Å resolution, resulting in
Rwork ∕Rfree values of 20.4%∕26.6% (Table S1). The subunit structure of S63W TubR is essentially identical to that of WT TubR as
revealed by their superimposition (rmsd of 1.2 Å) (Fig. 2 C and
D). However, this single subunit overlay shows that the S63W
TubR dimer, although the same as the WT in general arrangement, is forced into a more open oligomer conformation in which
one subunit is rotated 20° away from its dimer mate compared to
WT. This rotation is required to accommodate the bulky S63W
side chains (Fig. 2D). The N-terminal β1–β1′-sheet interaction
appears to play a key role in holding the TubR subunits together.
In addition, the tight stacking of the twofold related Trp63 indole
groups (3.5 Å) provides a compensatory interaction that, combined with the β1–β1′ interaction, apparently permits retention
of the dimer state, indicating why the TubR tryptophan mutants
were able to maintain the dimer state, albeit an altered dimer
state relative to WT (Fig. 2 C and D). By contrast, the TubR
arginine mutations, which introduced both bulk and charge within the predominantly hydrophobic dimer interface, were highly
destabilizing for dimerization. In addition, the finding that the
S63W TubR mutant forms an altered dimer explains the severe
effect on DNA binding because a correct dimer orientation is
likely essential for binding to its palindromic DNA sites (9).
TubR-DNA Model. Because all but the N-terminal residues of the

TubR recognition helices are buried in the dimer interface, TubR
must use a different mode of DNA binding than the ArsR or other
HTH containing proteins (23). Examination of surface electrostatics of TubR reveals that one face of the protein is electronegative, whereas the other is strongly electropositive (Fig. 3A).
Notably, the positive region is composed of one large and contiguous basic patch. Basic residues in this region correspond to Arg74, Arg-77, and Lys-79, in the wing and Lys-43, which is on α3, the
helix preceding α4 in the HTH motif. These residues were mutated
singly to alanine to examine their roles in DNA binding (Fig. 3B).
FP experiments showed that mutation of the basic wing residues
resulted in either a complete (R74A and R77A) or nearly complete (K79A) abrogation of DNA binding, indicating that the
wings play a major role in TubR DNA binding. Residue Lys-43
is surface exposed and located at the center of the basic region
on the TubR dimer (Fig. 3A). The K43A mutant also showed
no binding to TubR, supporting the notion that the continuous
basic patch of TubR represents its DNA-binding surface.
To gain insight into the structural mechanism of DNA binding,
a DNA duplex was docked onto the basic patch of the TubR diNi et al.

binding as a guide (Fig. 3C). This model revealed that the wings
are positioned to interact with successive minor grooves, with

either the bases or the phosphate backbone depending on the
ability of the DNA to deform. In the model TubR interacts with
a minimum of 14 bp of DNA. However, the centromere bound by

TubR consists of four 12-bp sites with the consensus T(T/A)(T/A)
(C/A)(G/A)GTTTA(A/C)(A/C) (9). Thus, we used FP to ascertain the binding stoichiometry of TubR for its 48-bp centromere.
As shown in Fig. 3D, eight TubR subunits or four TubR dimers
bind the 48-mer centromere, consistent with a dimer of TubR
binding each palindrome. Thus, either TubR distorts its DNA
or the TubR dimers bind with some degree of overlap on their
DNA sites perhaps imparting cooperativity, as observed in other
centromere-binding protein–DNA interactions (13, 14). In addition to the insertion of the wings, a striking outcome of the modeling was the finding that the N termini of the recognition helices,
which interact with each other in a parallel, coiled-coil-like manner, are in position to insert into a single major groove. Structures
of HTH proteins bound to DNA have thus far shown that the
recognition helices insert singly into successive major grooves
by using residues in the first few turns or the central portion
of the recognition helix to contact the DNA bases (Fig. 3E). Thus,
in the TubR-DNA model, the HTH–DNA interaction is dramatically different from any displayed previously by a HTH protein.
TubZ Binds TubR-DNA. A characteristic feature exhibited by
partition centromere-binding proteins is the ability to bind their
partner NTPase (13, 14). To determine if TubR binds TubZ, we
utilized a FP assay and found that full length (FL) TubZ bound
avidly to the TubR-centromere complex (Fig. 4A). However,
unlike other partition systems in which the NTPase must be complexed with nucleotide to bind its centromere-binding protein,
the interaction of TubR with TubZ did not require the presence
of GTP-Mg2þ . Previous studies have shown that the C-terminal
regions of tubulin and FtsZ mediate key binding events with their
target proteins (24–26). We noted that the terminal region of
TubZ, consisting of residues 407–484, is the most divergent region
between TubZ proteins and between TubZ and tubulin/FtsZ proteins, suggesting that it may be similarly utilized and bind TubR.
To test this hypothesis, we constructed various TubZ truncations,
TubZ(1-407), TubZ(1-442), TubZ(1-460), and TubZ(1-470), and
examined the ability of each protein to bind TubR-DNA. TubZ
(1-407) showed no binding to TubR, whereas the remaining truncation mutants bound weakly to TubR-DNA (Fig. 4A). Thus, the
data indicate that the last 14 amino acids of TubZ are critical for
the ability of TubZ to form a tight interaction with TubR but that
residues 408–470 also play an important role in this interaction.
These data demonstrate that TubR acts as a partition partner for
TubZ, linking it to pBtoxis plasmid DNA. Although TubZ has
been shown to form polymers in a GTP-dependent manner,
the TubZ protein displays limited sequence similarity to tubu-

lin/FtsZ, suggesting potential differences in TubZ and tubulin/
FtsZ structures (7–9). To gain insight into TubZ function, we next
determined structures of B. thuringiensis pBtoxis TubZ.
Structure of TubZ. Crystallization of FL TubZ was not successful, in
either its apo form or bound to guanine nucleotides. We noted that
FL TubZ degraded over time whereby C-terminal residues were
proteolyzed. Therefore, truncated TubZ proteins were utilized
in crystallization trials, and crystals were obtained of apo TubZ
(1-428) and the structure solved by MAD (Table S2). The model
consists of residues 1–79 and 91–404 and has an Rwork ∕Rfree of
21.4∕24.9% to 2.3-Å resolution (Fig. 4B). No discernible oligomerization of apo TubZ(1-428) was observed in the crystal packing,
and gel filtration analyses confirmed that it is monomeric
(Fig. S2). The overall TubZ structure can be divided into two main
domains: an N domain (residues 25–235) and a C domain (residues 258–377). These domains are connected by a long, core helix,
H7. The TubZ N domain has a Rossman fold and consists of six
parallel β-strands with topology 3-2-1-4-5-6. The resulting β-sheet
is sandwiched by five α-helices, with two helices on one side and
three on the other. The C domain consists of four β-strands with
the topology 1-4-2-3. The C-domain β-strands are arranged nearly
perpendicular to those in the N domain. In addition to these main
protein domains, there are two helices: one at the N terminus, H0,
and a long helix at the C terminus, H11 (Fig. 4B). Database
searches showed that TubZ indeed belongs to the tubulin/FtsZ family of proteins and is similar to both eukaryotic and prokaryotic
members of the family; TubZ can be optimally superimposed with
rmsds of 3.4 Å onto both bovine α tubulin and Pseudomonas
aeruginosa FtsZ (1, 5). Whereas the two-domain architectures
of tubulin, FtsZ, and TubZ are similar in overall structure, the
extreme N- and C-terminal regions of these proteins are very divergent (Fig. S3 A–D).
N-Terminal and C-Terminal Differences in TubZ, FtsZ, and Tubulin: Implications for Polymer Formation and Target Protein Binding. Tubulin

proteins do not contain significant N-terminal extensions,
whereas FtsZ proteins from different organisms show structural
variability within their N-terminal regions. For instance, in the
Escherichia coli FtsZ structure the N-terminal residues are disordered, whereas Methanococcus jannaschii FtsZ has an extra
N-terminal helix, H0, which is flexibly attached to the body of
the protein and has been captured in multiple orientations (5).
Although H0 is not conserved in FtsZ proteins, one M. jannaschii
FtsZ structure revealed a semicontinuous polymer in the crystal,
thought to closely represent in vivo protofilaments, which utilizes
H0 in subunit-subunit contacts (4). This finding suggests that
the flexibly attached H0 is stabilized in a specific orientation
by protofilament formation, at least in the M. jannaschii protein.
The TubZ H0 helix extends in the opposite direction compared to
that of the protofilament stabilized FtsZ H0 helix. Moreover, in
TubZ, H0 is not flexibly attached to the N domain but is tightly
anchored to the C domain through numerous interactions with
the core helix and C-domain residues. The large number of interactions involving H0, and the fact that it covers what would otherwise be a surface exposed hydrophobic patch, indicate that the
TubZ H0 does not undergo conformational changes during
protofilament formation and is important for the general fold
of TubZ (Fig. S3 A and C).
Data suggest that FtsZ and tubulin form protofilaments with
similar longitudinal contacts (4). However, the TubZ structure
reveals key differences, primarily in its C-domain and C-terminal
regions, which suggest that it forms protofilaments distinct from
those formed by tubulin/FtsZ. A notable difference is the structure of loop 7 (L7). This loop inserts into the adjacent subunit
providing the key catalytic residues required for GTP hydrolysis.
In tubulin/FtsZ proteins, L7 has the consensus GXXNXDXAD.
In TubZ, the loop is very divergent in conformation compared
Ni et al.

TubZ Interactions with Guanine Nucleotides. Consistent with TubZ
being a member of the tubulin/FtsZ family, our isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) studies showed that TubZ binds guanine
nucleotides with high affinity; K d s for GTP-γ-S and GDP were
∼0.69 and 26 μM, respectively (Fig. 5A). We next determined
the structure of the TubZ-GTP-γ-S complex by soaking GTP-γ-S
into preformed TubZ(1-428) crystals. The TubZ-GTP-γ-S structure contains TubZ residues 1–79 and 91–404, one GTP-γ-S,
and has Rwork ∕Rfree ¼ 21.8%∕25.5% (Fig. 5B and Table S2).
The structure shows that TubZ binds GTP-γ-S in the same GTP
binding pocket as tubulin/FtsZ (1–5). Comparison of the apo
and GTP-γ-S bound TubZ structures indicated that, like FtsZ,
guanine nucleotide binding does not lead to significant conformational changes (5). The phosphate binding pocket is formed by
two of the most highly conserved regions between TubZ and
tubulin/FtsZ called loops 1 and 4 (L1 and L4) (1–3). L1 contacts
the GTP-γ-S α- and β-phosphate groups via the Gln-32 and Lys-33
amide nitrogens. The L1 region of FtsZ and tubulin contain the
sequences GQ(A/G)G and GQCG, respectively, whereas in TubZ
the motif is 31-GQKG-34. However, the alanine/glycine and
cysteine residues in FtsZ and tubulin do not contact the bound
nucleotide; the TubZ Lys-33 side chain makes stacking interacNi et al.

tions with the guanine base (Fig. 5B). L4 represents the so-called
signature motif [GGGTG(T/S)G], which serves as an identifier of
tubulin/FtsZ family members. Like FtsZ and tubulin, the L4
region of TubZ-GTP-γ-S makes phosphate interactions via its
glycine amide nitrogens. Whereas L1 and L4 residues of the N
domain mediate phosphate contacts, the GTP-γ-S guanine moiety
is specified from residues in the core helix, H5, and C domain. In
this regard, an important motif is loop 6 (L6). In FtsZ and tubulin,
L6 has the consensus (F/Y)XXX(N/D) and the conserved (F/Y)
residue functions in guanine base stacking. This region in TubZ,
236-WKXXXN-241, is in an altered conformation compared to
FtsZ and tubulin structures. Despite the presence of the tryptophan, which might be expected to interact with the guanine,
the side chain of Lys-237 instead stacks with the guanine ring.
Hence, in the TubZ-GTP-γ-S structure, the guanine base does
not interact with aromatic residues as in tubulin/FtsZ but is sandwiched between the aliphatic portions of two lysine side chains,
Lys-33 and Lys-237. Finally, two asparagine residues, Asn-213
and Asn-241, from L6 effectively read the guanine N2/N3 and
N1/O6 atoms, respectively, providing high specificity in TubZ’s interaction with guanine nucleotides.
pBtoxis DNA Segregation: TubR Plasmid Partition Model. Our data
show that TubR binds to the flexible, C-terminal, basic region
of TubZ. The flexibility and location of the TubZ C-terminal
extension suggest that it is not required for polymerization and
thus may be exposed on the surface of TubZ filaments. Indeed,
negative stain EM images show that TubZ(1-407) forms polymers
in a GTP-dependent manner similar to the FL protein (Fig. S5).
Recent data suggesting that TubZ filaments are stabilized by

to that in FtsZ/tubulin and consists of the sequence 256DNVTYDPSD-266. In addition to the N-terminal region, the
extreme C-terminal extensions of tubulin, FtsZ, and TubZ are
structurally divergent (Fig. S3B). In FtsZ, the C-terminal region
forms a small, two-stranded β-sheet and continues into an extended region that is involved in binding adaptor proteins such
as FtsA and ZipA (6, 25). By contrast, the C-terminal regions
of tubulin proteins consist of a two-helix bundle followed by an
extended region. Like FtsZ, however, these regions interact with
numerous target proteins such as the microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) (24). Consistent with this, the C-terminal regions of
tubulin have been shown to face the outside of the microtubule. A
characteristic feature of the extreme C-terminal extensions of
tubulin proteins is their highly acidic nature (3). This acidic region
has been shown to be critical for binding to several MAPs that
harbor a substantial basic character, such as tau, MAP2, and
MAP4 (24, 27).
The TubZ C-terminal region is also helical, but it contains a
single, long helix. Notably, the TubZ-tubulin overlay shows that
the long C-terminal helix of TubZ would dramatically clash with
the adjacent subunit in a polymer, providing support for the notion that TubZ forms protofilaments different from tubulin/FtsZ
(Figs. S3B and S4). Interestingly, and in contrast to tubulin proteins, the flexible C-terminal region of TubZ that follows H11 is
highly basic, in particular the last 14 residues. We have shown that
these residues play a central role in TubR binding (Fig. 4A). TubR
uses its electropositive face for DNA binding, leaving exposed its
opposite face for TubZ interaction. Notably, this exposed face is
strongly electronegative and hence would complement the basic
C-terminal tail of TubZ (Fig. 3A).
Tubulin/FtsZ protofilaments combine to form higher-order
structures. In tubulin, the protofilaments interact in a parallel
manner to form microtubules. Central to microtubule formation
are lateral contacts between protofilaments from the so-called M
loop, between H10 and S9. In tubulin, this loop is composed of 13
residues (1–3). The corresponding loop is much shorter in FtsZ
proteins, consistent with the fact that FtsZ does not form tubulin
microtubule-like structures (5, 28–30). In TubZ, the M loop is
even shorter than in FtsZ, spanning only four residues. In fact,
the TubZ/tubulin overlay shows that the side of the molecule containing the M loop is the most divergent between these proteins.
These combined findings suggest that TubZ not only forms protofilaments with distinct longitudinal contacts compared to FtsZ
and tubulin, but it also does not form tubulin-like microtubule
structures.

shown in Fig. 6. In this model, multiple TubR dimers first bind
to the iteronic DNA on the pBtoxis plasmid leading to the creation of a high local concentration of TubR, which can recruit a
TubZ polymer, likely by interactions between the acidic TubR
dimer face and the basic C-terminal TubZ region. Importantly,
this interaction serves to attach the pBtoxis plasmid to the TubZ
polymer, which undergoes treadmilling, adding subunits at the þ
end and losing subunits at the − end. The bound TubR-pBtoxis
can be handed off from the − end to the molecules in the growing
þ end, leading to the transport of the pBtoxis plasmid to the cell
pole. Interestingly, it has been shown that once TubZ polymers
reach and interact with the cell pole, they bend around the curved
pole and continue growing in the other direction (7). The force of
the interaction with the membrane likely causes the release of
TubR-pBtoxis, the net result being transport of pBtoxis to the cell
pole. Of course, this model is simplified and many questions remain. For example, how directionality is achieved and how the
replicated plasmids are driven to opposite cell poles is not clear.
However, given the large size of the pBtoxis plasmid (8), it may be
that only one TubR-pBtoxis “tram” can be bound at once by the
rapidly treadmilling TubZ polymer and that, once one such a tram
is unloaded after reaching the cell pole, another engages when the
now reversed polymer treadmills toward the opposite cell pole.
Fig. 6. pBtoxis DNA partition model. In the first step, TubR, which is bound
to its centromere on one of the replicated pBtoxis plasmids, contacts the TubZ
C-terminal region (indicated by lines pointing from the TubZ “circles”) in a
treadmilling TubZ polymer. TubZ subunits are lost from the − end and are
added to the þ end. TubR is pulled along the growing polymer by its
TubR-TubZ interaction until it reaches the cell pole and is knocked off when
it comes into contact with the membrane at the cell pole. TubZ reverses
direction and may pick up the other TubR-pBtoxis complex and deliver it
similarly to the opposite cell pole.

Materials and Methods Summary
Detailed methods are provided in SI Materials and Methods.
Briefly, the tubR and tubZ genes were codon optimized (for
E. coli expression), subcloned into pET15b, expressed, and purified. WT TubR crystals were grown with NaCl and phosphate.
TubR S63W was crystallized with PEG and ethylene glycol and
TubZ with sodium formate. Detailed assay conditions for FP,
ITC, electron microscopy, and gel filtration are provided in
SI Materials and Methods.

the presence of a GTP cap and undergo treadmilling are consistent with the notion that TubZ displays tubulin-like polymer dynamics (12). Thus, on the basis of the combined data, we suggest
a model for TubR/TubZ mediated pBtoxis plasmid segregation
