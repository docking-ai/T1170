The vast majority of biological carbon dioxide fixation relies on the
function of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase
(Rubisco). In most cases the enzyme exhibits a tendency to become
inhibited by its substrate RuBP and other sugar phosphates. The
inhibition is counteracted by diverse molecular chaperones known
as Rubisco activases (Rcas). In some chemoautotrophic bacteria, the
CbbQO-type Rca Q2O2 repairs inhibited active sites of hexameric
form II Rubisco. The 2.2-Å crystal structure of the MoxR AAA+ protein CbbQ2 from Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans reveals the helix 2 insert (H2I) that is critical for Rca function and forms the axial pore of
the CbbQ hexamer. Negative-stain electron microscopy shows that
the essential CbbO adaptor protein binds to the conserved, concave
side of the CbbQ2 hexamer. Site-directed mutagenesis supports a
model in which adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP)-powered movements of the H2I are transmitted to CbbO via the concave residue
L85. The basal ATPase activity of Q2O2 Rca is repressed but strongly
stimulated by inhibited Rubisco. The characterization of multiple
variants where this repression is released indicates that binding of
inhibited Rubisco to the C-terminal CbbO VWA domain initiates a
signal toward the CbbQ active site that is propagated via elements
that include the CbbQ α4-β4 loop, pore loop 1, and the presensor 1-β
hairpin (PS1-βH). Detailed mechanistic insights into the enzyme repair chaperones of the highly diverse CO2 fixation machinery of
Proteobacteria will facilitate their successful implementation in synthetic biology ventures.

teria (16, 17). Different CbbQO Rca isoforms can activate either
the hexadecameric form I or the hexameric form II Rubisco (18).
CbbQ belongs to the relatively poorly studied MoxR group of
AAA+ proteins (19–21). The MoxR family is closely related to
the AAA domains of midasin and dynein, with all belonging to
the helix 2 insert (H2I) clade (22). CbbQ forms ring-shaped
hexamers but cannot activate Rubisco unless copurified with
the adaptor protein CbbO, with 1 monomer binding to a CbbQ
hexamer (18, 23). CbbO is an ∼750-residue protein possessing a
C-terminal von Willebrand factor A (VWA) domain that is essential for Rubisco activation. MoxR AAA+ proteins are frequently encoded in an operon with VWA domain containing
proteins (20), and an adaptor function of the VWA protein has
also been described for the RavA-ViaA chaperone, which modulates the activity of Escherichia coli fumarate reductase (24).
AfQ2O2 is the CbbQO-type Rca encoded by Acidithiobacillus
ferrooxidans, which acts on hexameric form II Rubisco AfM as its
substrate (18). Toward testing mechanistic hypotheses, we have
solved the crystal structure of AfCbbQ2. Negative-stain electron
microscopy (EM) data of AfQ2O2 show that the CbbO adaptor
Significance
Life depends on the ability of organisms such as plants to
convert the gas carbon dioxide into sugar molecules to produce
energy and build biomass. Most of this activity is catalyzed by
the CO2-fixing enzyme Rubisco. In spite of its crucial role, the
enzyme can become blocked by its own substrate and other
molecules. Specialized molecular chaperones (Rubisco activases) recognize inhibited Rubiscos and cause conformational
rearrangements that lead to inhibitor release. Bacteria that
derive energy from inorganic matter contain a complex, convergently evolved Rubisco activase. This molecular helper uses
a cup-shaped motor to manipulate an adaptor protein.
Changes are then passed from the adaptor to the inhibited
Rubisco, resulting in inhibitor release. This understanding will
enable precise synthetic biology applications.

lobal biomass production is largely reliant on the function of
the ubiquitous CO2-fixing enzyme ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate
carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco), which serves as the entry point
of carbon dioxide into the Calvin–Benson cycle (1–4). The enzyme tends to present with modest catalytic properties, being
slow and prone to catalyze a metabolite-damaging oxygenation
reaction (5). In addition, Rubisco needs to be activated by a
nonsubstrate CO2 and a Mg2+ cofactor (6). In their absence, it is
prone to form inhibited complexes with its substrate ribulose 1,5bisphosphate (RuBP), as well as other sugar phosphates (7).
Even the activated holoenzyme will form inhibited complexes
with a suite of molecules (8). These properties have prompted
the evolution of at least 3 clades of Rubisco activases (Rcas) in
different autotrophic lineages. They are all molecular chaperones, belonging to the AAA+ (ATPases associated with various
cellular activities) superfamily (9, 10), that recognize inhibited
Rubisco active sites and use the energy of adenosine 5′triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis to effect the release of the inhibitors. Three Rca classes have been discovered, and their
mechanisms are understood to varying degrees (11–13). Both
red- and green-type Rcas form hexameric ring-shaped particles
and utilize a loop lining the central pore (pore-loop 1) to remodel the Rubisco substrate (12, 14, 15). Red-type Rca transiently threads the Rubisco large subunit C terminus whereas the
moiety targeted by green-type Rca is not known. Recently, we
have described the CbbQO-type Rubisco activase, which is found
widely distributed in genomes of chemoautotrophic proteobacwww.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1911123117

central β-sheet with 5 parallel β-strands, ordered as 5-1-4-3-2,
sandwiched between 6 α-helices. The α-helical (small) subdomain consists of 5 antiparallel α-helices (Fig. 1A). The large
subdomain contains both a presensor 1-β hairpin (PS1-βH)
(residues 132 to 143), which cradles a helix 2 insert (H2I) (residues 81 to 95), elements that, in AAA+ proteins, are frequently
involved in substrate interactions (26, 27). The H2I was not resolved in the earlier HnCbbQ structure (23) and forms a β-hairpin
(Fig. 1 A and B). The N-terminal large subdomain contains the
canonical Walker A and B motifs (residues 44 to 50 and 107 to
111, respectively) and a pore loop with the sequence Asn71,
Glu72, and Asp73. The sensor I and sensor 2 motifs are residues
Ser153 and Arg226, respectively. The Arg172 is the arginine finger
(Fig. 1A and SI Appendix, Fig. S1B) (28). As observed for
HnCbbQ (23), each protomer was found to be bound to 1 adenosine 5′-diphosphate (ADP) and 1 PO4 molecule in the active site,
presumably the posthydrolysis state derived from copurification of
environmental ATP.
The C-terminal helices α6 and α7 in chain A are involved in an
extensive contact with α3 and β5 in its neighboring chain B (Fig.
1C and SI Appendix, Fig. S1A). In addition, the H2I contacts its
counterpart on chain B. Overall, an average interface area of
1,999.4 Å2 was buried between chain A and chain B, accounting
for 14.6% of the solvent-exposed surface area (13,705.9 Å2) of
each protomer.
The diameter of the hexameric ring is ∼107 Å while the height
and the central pore size of the hexamer is ∼56 and 9.8 Å, respectively (Fig. 1D). The much smaller pore size compared to

binds to the highly conserved concave surface of the AAA+
hexamer. Biochemical data are consistent with movements of the
pore-forming H2I being propagated to AfM-Rubisco via CbbO.
Similar to other AAA+ proteins (25), CbbQO ATPase activity is
suppressed in the absence of its substrate, AfM-Rubisco. Mutagenesis revealed multiple residues on both CbbQ and CbbO
involved in this suppression, outlining possible paths of communication from the inhibited AfM-Rubisco via CbbO to the
CbbQ active site.

The Structure of AfCbbQ2. The crystal structure of AfCbbQ2 was
determined at 2.2 Å. The asymmetric unit consists of 3 protomers (chains A, B, and C), which form a homotrimer (SI Appendix, Fig. S1). The structure is highly similar to the search
model (PDB ID code 5C3C) from Halothiobacillus neapolitanus
(HnCbbQ) (23), with a root-mean-square (RMSD) value of
0.63 for the aligned 213 Cα atoms (chain A) (SI Appendix, Fig.
S2). Importantly 2 segments (residues 79 to 89 and 153 to 159)
that are disordered in the HnCbbQ structure are well resolved in
the AfCbbQ2 structure. The final model covers all residues,
excluding the first 5, which are probably flexible. Chain A and B
share the largest contact interface and form a hexamer, resembling the oligomeric state in solution (18), with 2 neighboring
dimers from their crystallographic symmetry molecules.
The AfCbbQ2 protomer displays a typical AAA+ family
protein architecture (10) and is composed of an N-terminal α/β
subdomain (residues 39 to 177) and a C-terminal α-helical subdomain (residues 182 to 272), linked by a short loop (residues

The CbbQ Hexamer Interacts with CbbO via Its Concave Surface. One
hundred CbbQ2 sequences (defined by being encoded directly
downstream of a form II Rubisco gene) were mined from the JGI
Integrated Microbial Genomes and Microbiomes system (29). The
sequences (Dataset S1) were aligned with MultAlin (30), and a
surface conservation score was mapped onto the AfCbbQ2 hexamer
(Fig. 1E) (31). The convex surface is poorly conserved among
CbbQ2 homologs, unlike red-type Rcas that engage Rubisco using
the axial pore on that side (14). In contrast, the concave side of the
AfCbbQ2 hexamer is highly conserved (23), which is indicative of a
protein–protein interaction surface (Fig. 1E). We then visualized
the AfQ2O2 complex using negative stain electron microscopy (Fig. 2
and SI Appendix, Fig. S3).
Although the micrographs suggested conformational heterogeneity, reference-free two-dimensional (2D) classification
(32,879 particles) yielded clear density for some subunits of the
AfCbbQ2 hexamer (Fig. 2A). Particles of selected 2D classes
(15,386 particles) (Fig. 2A) were subjected to three-dimensional
(3D) reconstruction and refined to 16 Å (Fig. 2B). When fitting
the electron density of the AfCbbQ2 hexamer (18), additional
density was apparent on the concave face, corresponding to
CbbO2 (SI Appendix, Fig. S3D). The subunit extends from the
rim to the hexamer to the central cavity, occluding the pore.
Three subunits of the AfCbbQ2 hexamer contact the adaptor
CbbO and are thus not clearly defined in the model. The other
3 subunits are adjacent to each other and clearly visible.
Recently, it has been found that the VWA domain of the ribosome maturation factor Rea1/Mdn1 docks in the center of the

The Concave H2I Residue L85 Mediates Activase Activity. To take
advantage of the structural insights, we purified and biochemically characterized an assortment of AfQ2O2 complexes
with amino acid substitutions in both CbbQ and CbbO (SI
Appendix, Fig. S4). Complexes were assayed for the relative
ability to remove the tight-binding transition-state analog
carboxy-arabinitol bisphosphate (CABP) (34) from the activated form II Rubisco holoenzyme (ECM) (18). In addition, we
assayed ATP hydrolysis rates of the complexes in the absence
(basal) and presence (stimulated) of 3 μM inhibited AfM–
Rubisco complexes. These were the enzyme–RuBP complex
(ER) or the holoenzyme–CABP complex (ECMC) (18).
The current model for green- and red-type Rca function involves substrate engagement of the disk-shaped hexamer using
its convex surface, followed by transient threading of a portion of
Rubisco through the central pore of the hexamer via a pore-loop
1 (β2-α2 loop) tyrosine. Structural and biochemical data support
this mechanism for the red-type Rubisco activases from proteobacteria and red algae, which thread the Rubisco large subunit C terminus (12, 14, 35). Pore loop 1 is also important for
green (plant)-type Rubisco activase function, but the target
moiety on Rubisco is unresolved (15). Unlike green- and redtype Rca, the axial pore of the AfCbbQ2 hexamer is formed by
the H2I, and pore-loop 1 is not accessible from the convex surface (Fig. 3A). To constrain mechanistic models of CbbQO
function, we therefore mutated residues in the vicinity of the
pore. Convex face H2-insert residues D86 and D88 are poorly
conserved (Fig. 3B) and were substituted by alanine. The activity
of the mutant activases was not significantly different to wildtype (Fig. 3 C and D). Mutation of the adjacent L85 residue to
alanine resulted in an uncoupled phenotype where basal ATPase
was present at about 200% of the wild-type (Fig. 3D), but
stimulation by inhibited AfM-Rubisco was abolished and
Rubisco activase activity reduced to ∼10% (Fig. 3 C and D).
L85 is part of H2I, but it faces the concave surface (Fig. 3A).
Substitution of L85 with the charged residues lysine and aspartate resulted in complete abolishment of both activase function
and stimulation of ATPase (Fig. 3 C and D).
This result implicates H2I in AfM-Rubisco remodeling via the
concave L85 residue, instead of a typical (convex) pore-loop type
function. We hypothesize that its side chain will form a hydrophobic interaction with CbbO and feature as a key contact mediating both transmission of mechanical force from CbbQ to the
CbbO adaptor and transmit information regarding the presence
of inhibited AfM-Rubisco from the adaptor to the motor. We
then determined a temperature activity profile for Q2(L85A)O2.
Whereas the wild-type Q2O2 ATPase activity was still increasing
at 50 °C, Q2(L85A)O2 had its temperature optimum at 40 °C (SI
Appendix, Fig. S5). Thus, the interaction between CbbQ and
CbbO is compromised in this mutant.

the center of our hexamer was not observed earlier when
AfCbbQ2 complexed with a CbbO protein lacking the C-terminal
VWA domain was imaged (18). Consistently the central density in
our model accommodates a VWA domain well, and we thus interpret this density as the AfM-Rubisco interacting VWA domain
of CbbO (Fig. 2C).

Multiple Substitutions Can Relieve the Basal ATPase Suppression of
CbbQO. To assess whether pore-loop 1 in its concave location was

also involved in AfM-Rubisco activation, multiple residues were
substituted with alanine. Activase function for N71A and E72A
variants was not significantly different to wild-type. D73A
exhibited both significantly reduced ATPase and activase function (Fig. 3 C and D). Both the basal and ER-stimulated ATPase
rates of E72A were increased (5- and 2.5-fold, respectively)
compared to that of wild-type (Fig. 3D). This result indicates that

E72 is involved in suppressing the ATP hydrolysis function of
CbbQO to the low basal level, similar to the function of the
glutamate switch residues in other AAA+ ATPases (25). In the
active site formed by Chain A, the side chain of E72 forms a salt
bridge with the amino group of K166 in the β4-α4 loop of the
adjacent subunit, which also donates the trans-arginine finger
(R172) to the active site (Fig. 4 A and B). K166 also interacts
with E114, which is adjacent to the Walker B E111. It is possible
that this interaction network constrains movement of the arginine finger and/or the Walker B glutamate and thus limits basal
ATPase (Fig. 4B). The K166A mutant exhibited robust (∼80%)
activase activity (Fig. 4C). As predicted, we found that basal
ATPase activity was indeed 3-fold faster than the wild-type (Fig.
4D). Our structure did not reveal the presence of a “traditional”
glutamate switch where the Walker B glutamate is hydrogenbonded to a gate-keeper residue (25).
Multiple additional variants resulting in some loss of the basal
ATPase suppression were encountered. These include F and L
substitutions of the H2I insert residue W83 reported earlier (18),
as well as the T75A mutant (Fig. 4D). K138, which is a conserved
residue at the apex of the PS1-βH, also maintains the basal
suppression of the ATP hydrolysis rate. These residues are all in
the vicinity of the critical L85 moiety, and mutation likely favors
conformations that mimic those elicited by AfM-Rubisco binding. Additional structural information, such as the conformation
of CbbQ subunits while bound to the adaptor protein CbbO, will
enable more accurate interpretations of these results.
The Concave Residue L161 Signals Rubisco Presence. In order to test
whether we could disrupt the interaction between the CbbQ
hexamer and the CbbO adaptor, we mutated the conserved hydrophobic surface residue L161, located in the β4-α4 loop (part
of the second region of homology [SRH]) (10) near the rim of
the concave side (Fig. 4A). Q2O2 complexes with substitutions of
L161 to alanine, lysine, and aspartate were readily purified, indicating that the interaction with CbbO was not significantly
affected. In addition, the temperature activity profile of
Q2(L161K)O2 indicated that the complex was stable up to at
least 50 °C (SI Appendix, Fig. S5). Whereas Q2(L161A)O2 was a
fully functional activase, its basal ATPase rate was 8-fold increased compared to the wild-type. Addition of stably inhibited
384 | www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1911123117

ECMC AfM-Rubisco resulted in full stimulation of ATPase activity, as observed for the wild-type, indicating that AfM-Rubisco
sensing was intact. In contrast, when L161 was substituted with
lysine, the ATPase rate of the resultant activase was fully
stimulated, irrespective of whether inhibited AfM-Rubisco was
present (Fig. 4D). Rca function was mostly intact (85%) (Fig.
4C). Substitution of L161 with aspartate resulted in an intriguing inverse signaling phenotype. The basal ATPase of this
variant was faster than that of the fully stimulated wild-type
activase, but addition of inhibited ECMC AfM-Rubisco resulted in a 34% reduction of the ATP hydrolysis rate (Fig. 4D).
Concomitantly, the activase activity was also reduced to half
(Fig. 4C).
We were interested whether the high basal ATPase activity of
Q2(L161K)O2 required the critical L85 residue and consequently produced and characterized a L85A/L161K double mutant. The double mutant was unable to activate AfM-Rubisco
(Fig. 4C) and had a low ATP hydrolysis rate similar to Q2(L85A)
O2 (Fig. 3D), indicating that the side chain of L85 is critically
involved in the L161-mediated signaling pathway.
These data in summary suggest that L161 is involved in the
signaling pathway from the site of AfM-Rubisco sensing to the
CbbQ active site, with L85 an essential component of this
pathway. Mutagenesis of L161 can uncouple and even reverse
this signal.
The C Terminus of CbbO Communicates to the CbbQ Motor. We have
previously shown that both stimulation of ATPase and the activase function of the CbbQO complex depend on an intact metal
ion dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) motif at the C-terminal
VWA domain of CbbO. Our proposed model includes an interaction of this motif with the surface-exposed E75 residue of
the AfM-Rubisco large subunit (18). When examining a large
sequence alignment of CbbO sequences, we noticed that its C
terminus was of conserved length, most frequently featuring an
LTX motif (Fig. 4E). To assess the functional significance of this
observation, we prepared a series of Q2O2 complexes mutated at
the C terminus of CbbO. All variants generated were still functional at activating AfM-Rubisco although deleting the 2 Cterminal residues (ΔC2) resulted in a 40% reduction (Fig. 4F).
In contrast, the ATPase function of CbbO variants was highly

variable. Shortening CbbO by 1 residue (ΔC1) resulted in a 5fold increase in basal and 3-fold increase in ER-stimulated
ATPase activities (Fig. 4G). The additional removal of another
amino acid in Q2O2(ΔC2) led to severe derepression of ATPase
activity, with the basal ATPase rate increasing ∼30-fold to 65 min−1.
As observed earlier for Q2(L161D)O2, the ΔC2 variant exhibited
an inverse signaling phenotype, with inhibited Rubisco leading to a
reduction of ATPase activity (Fig. 4G). Substituting the final
2 amino acids with alanine led to an activase (T758A/R759A) that
was largely deregulated. Basal ATPase was similar to that of fully
stimulated wild-type activase, and addition of inhibited AfMRubisco only led to slight increases in activity. These results
demonstrate that the C terminus of CbbO, which forms part of the
functionally critical VWA domain, is involved in sensing the
presence of AfM-Rubisco, and this information is then transmitted to the CbbQ motor.

Discussion
In this work, we have used a crystal structure of AfCbbQ2 in
conjunction with negative stain EM and site-directed mutagenesis to further develop our mechanistic model for this MoxR
AAA+ ATPase (Fig. 5). A key difference to other Rubisco
activases concerns the convex side of the axial pore, which is not
involved in AfM-Rubisco activation and thus does not participate in a pore-loop threading mechanism. However, mutants of
H2I residue L85, which is located on the conserved concave
surface of the hexamer, exhibit uncoupled ATP hydrolysis and
Rubisco activase activities. In addition, L85 mutants no longer
respond to the presence of inhibited AfM-Rubisco. Since EM
shows that the concave face of CbbQ is occupied by the adaptor
protein CbbO, we reason that 1 or more L85 residues will bind
the single adaptor and be critical to transmit force from the
CbbQ hexamer to CbbO, which will then remodel the inhibited

In summary, here, we significantly expand the structural and
biochemical information available on this MoxR AAA+ chaperone. We envisage that the underlying principles will hold true
for this large, but mostly uncharacterized, group of prokaryotic
molecular chaperones (20, 21), such as the NorQ/NorD maturation machinery for nitric oxide reductase (43). In addition,
more detailed information on the regulation and maintenance of
microbial carbon dioxide fixation machinery will be essential to
inform synthetic biology ventures aiming to incorporate such
modules (44, 45).

Fig. 5. Model of CbbQO function. The VWA domain of the Rca’s CbbO
adaptor protein engages the acidic surface residue E75 of the inhibited
Rubisco. Rubisco binding results in a signal which originates at the VWA
domain and is transferred toward the CbbQ active sites to release the suppressed ATPase activity. Both L161 (β4-α4 loop) and L85 are involved in signal
transmission. L85 is likely involved in force transmission from the hexamer to
the CbbO adaptor, which will remodel the inhibited Rubisco to trigger active
site opening and inhibitor release. The Q2O2 model is an overlay of the EM
reconstruction and the AfQ2 crystal structure shown in ribbon representation. L161 (red) and L85 (magenta) are shown as spheres. Rubisco is a surface
representation of the hexameric Rhodopseudomonas palustris form II
Rubisco (PDB ID code 4lf1).

AfM-Rubisco substrate. We note that, in dynein, which also
belongs to the H2I clade of AAA+ proteins (22), the H2I of
AAA2 interacts with the dynein linker via a hydrophobic interaction, and H2I is involved in the linker-swing movement (36).
In another member of the same clade, Mdn1/Rea1 (midasin),
the H2I of AAA2 directly contacts the MIDAS domain, which,
despite being 2,000 residues C-terminal to the AAA ring, occupies the central hole of the AAA ring (32, 33).
The ATPase activity of AAA+ protein is commonly observed
to be stimulated upon engaging their macromolecular substrates
(14, 37, 38). In multiple clades, this has been linked to a glutamate
switch mechanism where the Walker B glutamate is hydrogenbonded to a gatekeeper residue (25, 39). Interaction with the substrate abolishes this interaction, leading to increased ATPase activity. We hypothesize that the interaction between the β4-α4 loop
residue K166 and E72 and E114 may function as an analogous
switch for CbbQO (Fig. 4B). Mutations of K166 and E72 to Ala
increase ATPase activity. The loss of this interaction thus phenocopies AfM-Rubisco binding, and this may then position elements,
such as the Walker B glutamate (E111) and the arginine finger
(R172), into conformations more conducible to ATP hydrolysis.
Mutation of the PS1-βH K138 also released basal ATPase
suppression. PS1-βH also buttresses the H2I of other AAA+
proteins and there participates in an intersubunit signaling (ISS)
cascade (40) mediated by a conserved aspartate that interacts
with the arginine finger (27, 41). The ISS aspartate is conserved
in CbbQ (D128) and may also function in this role.
Biochemical data indicate that the MIDAS motif of the CbbO
VWA domain interacts with the conserved acidic residue E75 on
the AfM-Rubisco large subunit, which results in derepression of
CbbQ’s basal ATPase rate (18) (Fig. 5). Here, we have shown
that truncations of the VWA domain’s C-tail are sufficient to
stimulate the Q2O2 ATPase rate. We hypothesize that the VWA
domain of these mutants is in a conformation that mimics the
Rubisco-bound state. Such conformational changes, accompanied by signaling, have been thoroughly described for the VWA
domain of the integrin α I domain (42). The signal leading to
derepression of the basal ATPase is then transmitted to the active site via the β4-α4 loop residue L161 on the concave rim of
the CbbQ hexamer, but only if the key H2I residue L85 is intact.

Molecular Biology and Proteins. AfQ2O2 and all variants were produced using
E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells harboring pHueAfCbbQ2 and pBAD33UbAfCbbO2.
The relevant mutations in the plasmids were generated using the
QuikChange protocol. The purification protocol was exactly as described
(18). The form II Rubisco AfM was produced in BL21 (DE3) cells transformed
with pHueAfcbbM and purified as described (18). For crystallization, the
AfcbbQ2 gene from pHueAfCbbQ2 was subcloned into a modified pOP
vector (pOPTHis6-lipoyl) (http://hyvonen.bioc.cam.ac.uk/pop-vectors/). The
His6-lipoyl-CbbQ2 was purified using Ni-NTA affinity and gel filtration
chromatography. The protein was concentrated to 15 mg/mL and stored in
20 mM Hepes, pH7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, and 10 mM
MgCl2. Primers used in this study are given in SI Appendix, Table S2.
Crystallography. His6-lipoyl-CbbQ2 crystals were obtained using the sittingdrop vapor-diffusion method in 25% (vol/vol) 1,2-propanediol, phosphatecitrate, pH 4.2, 5% (vol/vol) PEG3000, and 10% (vol/vol) glycerol. The crystals
were fished from the screening drops and flash frozen by plunging into
liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected at beamline NSRRC 13B1,
and the data were processed using XDS (46). The AfCbbQ2 structure was
determined by molecular replacement using Phaser (47) with homolog
HnCbbQ (PDB ID code 5C3C) as a search model. Automatic model building
was employed using ARP/wARP (48). The model was further improved by
manual model building with Coot (49) and refined with Refmac5 (50) and
Phenix (51).
Electron Microscopy. Purified proteins diluted to a final concentration of
50 μg/mL in 20 mM Tris·HCl, pH8.0, 50 mM NaCl were applied to a carboncoated TEM grid and stained with 2% (wt/vol) uranyl acetate. A total of
49 micrographs were recorded on an FEI T12 transmission electron microscope equipped with a 4K CCD camera (FEI) at a magnification of 49,000×
and electron dose of 20 to 25 e−/Å 2, resulting in a pixel size of 2.11 Å per
pixel under low-dose conditions. A defocus range of −1.0 to 1.5 μm was
used. Single particles were selected automatically and processed with Relion3 (52). A total of 32,879 particles were used for reference-free unbiased 2D
classifications, after which 15,386 particles from selected 2D classes were
subjected to 3D reconstructions using a 3D model generated in Relion. The
3D refinement resulted in a 3D EM map of Q2O2 resolved to 16 Å resolution
using gold standard criteria (0.143 criterion).
Enzymatic Assays. AfM-Rubisco (20 μM active sites in 20 mM Tris·HCl, pH 8.0,
50 mM NaCl) was activated to form the active ECM by incubation with 40 mM
NaHCO3 and 10 mM MgCl2. CABP was added to 80 μM to form inactive ECMC
complexes. RuBP-inhibited AfM-Rubisco (ER) was produced by incubating
20 μM AfM-Rubisco with 0.8 mM RuBP in the presence of 4 mM EDTA.
Rubisco activase assays and ATPase assays were performed at 25 °C using
the coupled spectrophotometric assays described (18). ATPase assays contained 0.27 μM activase (oligomer), 3 μM inhibited AfM-Rubisco (active sites)
if applicable, and 1 mM ATP. Activities are reported as turnovers per active site.
Activase assays contained 0.27 μM activase (oligomer) and 0.1 μM (active sites)
CABP-inhibited AfM-Rubisco (ECMC). Substrate concentrations were 1 mM RuBP
and 5 mM NaHCO3. To quantify the activase activity of AfQ2O2 variants, the
relative activity of ECMC 1 min after Rca addition was measured.
Statistical Analysis. Statistical comparisons were performed between the
biochemical activity of wild-type and mutant proteins using Welch’s t tests
and Bonferroni corrected α in OriginPro 2018b (OriginLab).
