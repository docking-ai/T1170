The double helix of DNA, when composed of dinucleotide purinepyrimidine repeats, can adopt a left-handed helical structure called
Z-DNA. For reasons not entirely understood, such dinucleotide
repeats in genomic sequences have been associated with genomic
instability leading to cancer. Adoption of the left-handed conformation results in the formation of conformational junctions: A
B-to-Z junction is formed at the boundaries of the helix, whereas
a Z-to-Z junction is commonly formed in sequences where the
dinucleotide repeat is interrupted by single base insertions or deletions that bring neighboring helices out of phase. B-Z junctions are
shown to result in exposed nucleotides vulnerable to chemical or
enzymatic modification. Here we describe the three-dimensional
structure of a Z-Z junction stabilized by Zα, the Z-DNA binding
domain of the RNA editing enzyme ADAR1. We show that the junction structure consists of a single base pair and leads to partial or
full disruption of the helical stacking. The junction region allows
intercalating agents to insert themselves into the left-handed helix,
which is otherwise resistant to intercalation. However, unlike a B-Z
junction, in this structure the bases are not fully extruded, and the
stacking between the two left-handed helices is not continuous.

n 1979 the crystal structure of a DNA molecule was published
(1). Although it was already known that nucleic acids could
adopt various alternative conformations, this crystal structure
was concrete evidence of the left-handed helical form of
DNA. This DNA conformation was called Z-DNA because of
its zigzag, sugar-phosphate backbone; its full biological relevance
had yet to be established.
Interest in Z-DNA has grown in time as additional evidence
for its in vivo existence has accumulated. Unlike right-handed
nucleic acids, Z-DNA is highly immunogenic, and both monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies were raised against Z-DNA (2, 3).
Antibodies allowed different groups to show that Z-DNA does
exist in vivo and also to map several regions more prone to be
in such conformation (4–7). Recently, bioinformatics tools have
been developed (8) that predict several genomic hot spots for
Z-DNA formation and suggested roles for such structures.
Significant experimental evidence regarding the in vivo presence of Z-DNA has accrued, but its biological role has not been
fully elucidated. Considerable progress has been made in discovering proteins that bind Z-DNA with great specificity. At present, four proteins able to bind the Z form of nucleic acids
have been described: the IFN-induced form of the RNA editing
enzyme ADAR1, the innate immune system receptor DAI (also
known as DLM-1 and ZBP1), the fish kinase PKZ, and the poxvirus inhibitor of IFN response E3L (9–12). These proteins all
have important roles in physiological and pathological processes
related to the IFN system. In addition, they share Z-DNA binding
ability because of a common, winged helix-turn-helix (wHTH)
domain named Zα. Isolated Zα domains from all of the abovementioned proteins have been crystallized in complexes with
9088–9092 ∣ PNAS ∣ May 18, 2010 ∣ vol. 107 ∣ no. 20

short stretches of DNA duplex ðCGÞ3 and shown to bind DNA
in the left-handed Z form in a very similar fashion (10, 13–16).
The Zα domain of ADAR1 was the first to be discovered and is
the best characterized of all Z-DNA binding proteins. ADAR1
is an adenosine deaminase responsible for the A-to-I editing of
RNA and exists in two alternative isoforms, one expressed constitutively and the other induced by IFNs. The IFN inducible form of
ADAR1 possesses two wHTH domains, Zα and Zβ, the former of
which became the prototype of all the Z domains and later was
shown to bind Z-RNA as well (17). Although Zβ shows the same
topology as other Z domains, it does not bind left-handed nucleic
acids (18). Apart from interest in the protein itself, Zα-ADAR1
is also a powerful tool to study left-handed nucleic acids
structures, because it is able to strongly stabilize such structures
under nearly physiological conditions.
Most of the structural and in vitro biochemical studies on
Z-DNA have been performed with short stretches of DNA
and mostly with plain CG repeats. CG repeats are used because
this sequence undergoes the B-to-Z structural transition most
readily. Unlike the right-handed B form, the repeating unit of
Z-DNA is a dinucleotide and in particular a purine-pyrimidine
repeat. Whereas such short oligonucleotides have been good
starting models because of the ease with which they can support
the B-to-Z transition, they do not accurately reflect the context in
which Z-DNA may form in vivo. Long stretches of perfect CG
repeats are infrequent in genomes because they represent hot
spots of genomic instability (19). Instead, in genomic sequences
we frequently find Z-DNA forming sequences in which the pattern of the Pu-Py dinucleotide repeat is broken by Pu-Pu or Py-Py
dinucleotides. Thus, in vivo, stretches of Z-DNA are characterized by the formation of B-Z and Z-Z conformational junctions.
The B-Z junction is formed at the interface between B- and
Z-DNA, and two of them form when a stretch of Z-DNA forms.
The Z-Z junction forms at a discontinuity when a single base is
inserted or deleted from the dinucleotide repeat leading to
Z-DNA helices out of phase from each other. The crystal structure of a B-Z junction was solved a few years ago (20). Its formation requires little structural disruption because it preserves
the integrity of both B- and Z-DNA helices as well as base stacking between the two helices. This stacking is made possible because of the full extrusion from the helix of the two junctional
bases that allows continuous stacking between the left- and
right-handed helices. The two extruded bases become accessible

Structure Determination of a Z-Z DNA Junction Bound by the ADAR1
Zα Domain. Here we report two crystal structures of the same com-

plex between Zα and a Z-Z junction forming the duplex sequence
ðCGÞ3 AðCGÞ3 , crystallized in slightly different conditions. The
best diffracting crystals were obtained initially at pH 7.0 by using
Hepes as a buffer, which has been the buffer used historically for
Zα purification and storage. When we found a Hepes molecule
located in the center of the junction (see details and Discussion
below), we set up crystallization trials of a Hepes-free sample with
different buffers in order to clarify the role of such a molecule in
junction formation and to evaluate to what extent the overall
structure is affected by its presence. We managed to obtain a
second dataset from crystals grown in a Tris buffered solution,
and here we compare the two structures.
Whereas the best conditions for the Hepes-containing structure required an initial high throughput robot screening and some
efforts in optimization, crystals of the Hepes-free sample were
obtained with just minor adjustments in the original conditions.
Crystals obtained in both conditions showed similar plate-like
morphology and kinetics of formation. They both belong to
the orthorhombic P21 21 21 space group, and even their cell
dimensions are very similar (see Table S1). The quality of the
two datasets collected is equivalent: The first crystal form
diffracted to 2.65 Å with an Rmerge of 9.2%, whereas the

Hepes-free one diffracted to 2.8 Å but with a slightly better
Rmerge equal to 8.3%.
Apart from the junction, the two structures are quite similar
(Fig. 1). A superimposition of the whole complex would not
be meaningful because the DNA molecule is differently kinked
at the junction position (see details below). Instead, we cut the
complex in an equatorial plane to obtain two ternary complexes
(two Zα molecules binding a six-mere duplex) and superimposed
these structures. We obtained an rmsd equal to 1.18 and 0.84 Å by
using all 500 of the DNA duplex atoms and 491 atoms of the protein
backbone. We will now describe one of the two complexes and underline the differences when it is appropriate. From now on, we will
refer to the Hepes-free complex as the Zα∕Z-Z-DNA structure.
The structure was solved by molecular replacement using
the first published Zα∕ðCGÞ3 structure as the searching model
[Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID code 1QBJ]. More precisely, to
avoid introduction of bias, we decided to use a minimal model
consisting in a single molecule of Zα-ADAR1 binding a single
strand six-mer of Z-DNA. We found four such complexes in
the asymmetric unit, and we could build the biological unit by
reassembling the molecules to form one double-stranded
Z-DNA molecule bound by four Zα monomers (Fig. 1).
Overall Structure and Stoichiometry of the Zα∕ðCGÞ3 AðCGÞ3 Complex.

Two complementary oligonucleotides were designed to study the
structure of a Z-Z junction. They consist in two overhanging
bases (AC and GT) at the 5′ followed by two ðCGÞ3 stretches
interrupted by an A (T in the complementary strand). Three consecutive CG repeats have been identified as the minimum binding
site for Zα. The two overhanging bases, even if not visible in most
of the previously published structures, are believed to help in
crystal packing. The out-of-phase base pair (A-T in our case)
should interrupt the Z-DNA helix, because the repeating unit
of Z-DNA is a dinucleotide.
It is already known that the protein/DNA stoichiometry is
crucial in the crystallization of Zα∕Z-DNA complexes. To determine the initial conditions for the optimal ratio Zα to Z-DNA, we
performed solution experiments by using CD. The CD spectra of
left- and right-handed DNA are significantly different (Fig. S1),
and by using different protein/DNA ratios we could show that four
molecules of Zα are required to obtain full conversion of the oligonucleotide to the left-handed conformation (Fig. S1, Inset).

Fig. 1. Overall structure of a Z-Z junction. The DNA duplex is shown as a skeletal model for the Hepes-free (Left, A) and Hepes (Right, B) structures, respectively,
colored according to atom type except for the Hepes molecule (Orange). In both cases four Zα domains are bound to the duplex ðCGÞ3 AðCGÞ3 DNA oligonucleotide and shown as ribbon diagrams. The molecular surface of each chain is shown transparent. We show aligned the oligonucleotide sequence (Middle).
The helical axis for each ðCGÞ3 segment appears as a straight line, and the angle corresponding to the DNA kink is indicated.

to solvent, giving rise to speculation that they could be sites for
enzymatic or chemical DNA modification. Aberrant translocations at CpG repeats involve the recruitment of the DNA repair
machinery (19). Thus, such base modifications may be an underlying causative agent of tumors in an unknown number of cases.
Z-Z junctions are expected to be as common as B-Z junctions,
and they require less energy to form (21). Long runs of CG
repeats interrupted by out-of-phase bases can be found in both
DNA (CpG islands) and RNA (Alu’s sequences) (22). The
frequency of such sequences has led to extensive work aiming
to understand the molecular features of Z-Z junctions.
Here we report the crystal structure of a Z-Z junction
stabilized by binding to Zα-ADAR1. Our results show that the
junction bases are not fully extruded, and unlike the B-Z junction
the base stacking is partially disrupted. We also show how such a
junction can be the target of intercalating agents to which Z-DNA
is resistant.

Indeed, we find the same stoichiometry in the crystal structures
(Fig. 1). Two molecules of Zα bind each of the two ðCGÞ3 portions.
Overall, the Zα domain interaction with the DNA helix is similar to
the one described previously for its complex with a single ðCGÞ3
duplex (13). Not only is the broad surface of interaction the same,
but also the intricate network of direct and indirect interactions
between protein and DNA is conserved in our structure, as can
be noted in Fig. 2. The Zα monomers show an average rmsd of
0.5 Å (56 Cα atoms used) when compared to the search model.
Most of the residues involved in the interaction are located in
the helix α3 and in the wing (Fig. 2). They can be divided into van
der Waals interacting residues (Pro192 and Pro193), residues interacting directly through hydrogen bonds to the DNA backbone
(Thr191, Lys169, Lys170, and Tyr177), and residues whose interaction with DNA is mediated by water molecules as Trp195.
Asn173 is at the same time able to directly bind the DNA and
also interact with one of the conserved water molecules. These
residues represent the core binding motif of Z-DNA and together
with the complementarity of the interacting surface lead to a very
high specificity and binding affinity.
Taken separately, the two stretches of six base-pair Z-DNA do
not differ significantly from previously published Z-DNA structures. In fact, if we ignore the junction, our structure shows
two Z-DNA helices that are close to ideal in conformational
parameters (Tables S2–S4). In particular, the slide and the twist
parameters are notable because they characteristically alternate
between purines and pyrimidines and apparently are in no way
affected either by the crystal packing or by the presence of the
junction. The unique exception is the adjacent CG pairs to the
junction in the Hepes-free structure that show a deformation
described in detail later.
Z-DNA possesses a straight helical axis. In our structure the
axes of the two CG hexamers form a sharp ∼20° angle because
of the presence of the junction, resulting in an overall kinked
DNA structure. This angle is slightly different in the two structures and equal to 20° in the Hepes structure and 27° in the
HEPES-free structure (Fig. 1).
A Close View of the Z-Z DNA Junction. Z-Z junctions have already
been investigated. In particular, two structural studies have been
published suggesting models for the Z-Z junction: An NMR
investigation carried out by Yang and Wang (23) was of a structure containing mismatches at the junction site and in which
the Z conformation was induced by organic and inorganic
compounds, not by Zα. Another study used diethyl pyrocarbonate
and hydroxylamine chemical probing along with molecular

modeling to define features of the junction (21). More recent work
uses fluorescent modified bases containing 2-amino purine (2AP)
to study base stacking at the junction site by fluorescence spectroscopy (24). The two older studies suggest that the junction bases
remain intrahelical with the NMR study predicting that the junction bases form a reverse Watson–Crick base pair. In contrast, in
the more recent study on the basis of 2AP fluorescence, the authors
interpreted the data with the junctional bases extruded from the
double helix similar to what has been seen for the B-Z junction
(20). Our results show no such base extrusion. However, the
base-pair formation at the junction shows differences from the
suggested models. These differences are described below.
During the refinement of the first structure with crystals
obtained in the presence of Hepes, we noticed a feature in the
electron density in the junction area adjacent to the well defined
base density (Fig. 3A). An initial hypothesis was that this density
represented some kind of double conformation of the bases;
however, occupancy refinement showed base occupancy close
to 1 and their electron density well defined. Discarding this option, we inspected the composition of the crystallization solution
and found that such electron density can be modeled as a Hepes
molecule. The structure was further refined and the Hepes
molecule ended up with a 0.8 occupancy and B factors varying
between 30 and 50 Å2 for the ring and slightly higher for the
hydroxyl and sulfonate groups (Table S5). The two bases of
the junction show a large roll and are almost orthogonal to
the plane of the previous and next base pair. The A-T pair interacts according to a reverse Watson–Crick geometry because
the hydrogen bonding atoms are N6 -O2 and N1 -N3 , although
the N-O hydrogen bond is very weak with a distance between
donor and acceptor of 3.5 Å (Fig. 3A).
The unexpected Hepes ligand, intercalating in a cavity created
between the A-T pair and the two C-G pairs before and after the
junction (Fig. 3B), seems to restore base stacking because its
semiplanar ring is parallel to the planes of the other bases. No
other interactions are observed between Hepes and DNA, apart
from the interactions between the sulfonate group of the molecule with N4 of C8 and O4′ of T7 and N7 of G6. The junctional
bases are almost perpendicular to the rest of the bases and can
be accommodated only because of the 20° kink of the helical axis.
Because the observed structure of the Z-Z junction might have
been influenced by the intercalation of Hepes, we also determined the structure in Hepes-free conditions. The Hepes-free
structure is significantly different at the junction site. Whereas

Discussion
We determined the crystal structure of a complex between a
ðCGÞ3 AðCGÞ3 DNA duplex and the Zα domain of ADAR1.
The ðCGÞ3 parts of the DNA adopt a typical Z-DNA structure,
but the overall DNA helix is significantly kinked at the junction.
This kink results in the creation of a cavity on one side of the
DNA structure and a compression on the opposite side. In our first
attempt of structure determination we found a Hepes molecule
occupying the predicted location of the AT base pair with the
bases themselves forming a partial base pair surprisingly oriented
perpendicular to the plane of the other bases in the DNA. In
this way the junction forms a cage for the buffer molecule. Whereas
this obviously is a crystallization artifact, it provides significant
insight into the dynamic nature of the junction, and it points
to the fact that the junction bases are sterically uncomfortable
and mobile.
Determining the structure in the absence of Hepes shows that
the junction bases can partially stack with the rest of the helix. The
adenosine is found in its expected position in the syn conformation
typical for Z-DNA but breaking the syn-anti alternation, whereas
the thymine is partially disordered apparently occupying two
positions, one in the syn and one in the anti orientation with an
occupancy of 0.5 for each orientation. Indeed the pyrimidine of
the junction shows the most unfavorable contacts and in solution
is expected to shift dynamically between the two conformations.
Unlike the B-Z junction, which by fully extruding the junction
bases succeeds in maintaining continuous stacking between the

right- and the left-handed helix, bases of the Z-Z junction remain
intrahelical and base stacking is partially lost (Fig. 4). Also, unlike
the B-Z junction, where only the Z portion is bound by Zα, in the
Z-Z junction both Z-DNA helices are bound by the protein. We
have to ask whether unfavorable protein–protein contacts affect
the junction structure by not allowing the two 6-mers getting
closer through extrusion of the junction bases. Indeed, modeling
of Zα binding to continuous 12-mer yields protein–protein
clashes between Zα molecules. Thus, the presence of Zα might
lead to capturing an intermediate state of the junction formation
blocking base extrusion and stacking of the two hexamers. On the
other hand, there is reasonable agreement of our structure with
the model of a Z-Z junction derived from the NMR data. That
model was derived from structures with mismatched A-A and T-T
pairs at the junction and predicted intrahelical junctional bases.
On the basis of the NMR structures, a model was proposed of an
AT junction with the bases being in syn (A) and anti (T) conformation and forming a reverse Watson–Crick base pair. We find
the adenosine in the syn conformation (χ ¼ 50), whereas the thymidine appears to have more than one conformation. However,
in none of the alternative conformations do we observe base
pairing, which is in good agreement with the observation that
the energetic cost of a Z-Z junction (3.5 kcal∕mol) (21) is similar
to that of the mismatched junctions. Another important feature
of the present structure that is absent in previous models is a partial melting of one of the adjacent CG pairs with hydrogen bonding distances that are more than 0.5 Å longer than the average
distances for the other CG base pairs of the helix (Table S2). The
mobility we observe for the T residue is also in good agreement
with the chemical reactivity results of Johnston et al. (21) showing
that a corresponding C (in this work the junction was a CG instead of AT) becomes hypersensitive in a Z-Z junction, whereas
the N7 of corresponding purine of the junction is shown to be
protected as would be expected from our structure. Overall,
the Hepes-free structure is in good agreement and explanatory
to the available biochemical and NMR data.
Another question is the extent to which the observed angle of
bending (27° in the Hepes-free structure) is influenced by the
enclosing Zα proteins. It can be seen (Fig. 1A) that the two
Zα molecules on the side of the bend are closer together when
the angle is 27°, compared to 20° for the Hepes structure (Fig. 1B).
The two Zαs are in van der Waals contact, suggesting that they
may limit further bending. This observation might support the
argument that the observed structure is trapped in an intermediate state. It is clear that this issue can be resolved only by further
structural studies, perhaps with fewer Zα molecules.
In recent work, base analogs of adenosine (2AP) were used to
monitor stacking of bases in different types of junctions using
fluorescent spectroscopy. This work suggested the loss of stacking
of the adenosine base at a Z-Z junction with a sequence similar
to the one we describe here. Although we do observe loss of base
stacking at the junction, this is because of the mobility of the
thymine residue. The adenosine residue, however, is not extruded; it is well defined and maintains optimal stacking with
the adjacent bases. The reason behind this disagreement is possibly because of the use of Hepes as a buffer in these fluorometric
studies that, as we see in the corresponding structure, results in
loss of stacking for the adenosine at the junction. It is also possible that the 2-amino purine substitution in this context alters
the properties of the already deformed junction in a way that
adenosine becomes more exposed.
Here we show how sequences containing imperfect CpG
repeats can adopt the left-handed conformation and tolerate
the formation of Z-Z junctions. This finding increases significantly the number of potential Z-forming sequences in genomic
DNA. Because Z-forming sequences and CpG repeats are
implicated in mammalian genomic instability (19) and cancer,
the structure presented here provides the basis to understand

it maintains the kink at the junction, the AT base pair (A7-T7) in
this structure lays on a plane that is almost parallel to the plane of
the other base pairs (Fig. 4A), and it occupies the position where
the Hepes molecule was found in the first structure. The observed
kink of the DNA helix in the absence of Hepes is slightly greater
(27°), and in this case we find the junction bases located in the
helix compression instead of the bulky Hepes molecule. The
Hepes-free structure is consistent with aspects of the model predicted by Yang and Wang with the well defined adenine base in
syn conformation like the preceding G6, maintaining stacking interactions. However, the electron density for the opposing base
T7 demonstrates ambiguity, which is best interpreted by the base
alternating between syn and anti conformation. This mobility of
T7 is supported from the fact that no optimal hydrogen bonding
to A7 on the opposite strand can be formed in any of the alternative conformations. In the anti conformation a single hydrogen
bond is formed between O4 of T7 to N6 of A7, whereas no hydrogen bonding is observed with T7 in the syn conformation.
Nevertheless, both conformations of ∼0.5 occupancy support
partial stacking of this base with the rest of the helix. While stacking is maintained, formation of the junction in the Hepes-free
structure also affects the lower G6-C8 base pair (Fig. 4A and
Table S2), resulting in a widening of the helix and hydrogen
bonding distances in the range of 3.3–3.8 Å. Interestingly, this
helix deformation is asymmetric affecting only one of the two
base pairs adjacent to the junction base pairs.

some of the molecular features that are involved in their mutagenic role. Whereas formation of B-Z and Z-Z junctions
increases the exposure of bases to modifying agents with mutagenic effects, the Hepes structure suggests also that a Z-Z junction can be a site for intercalation and a potential target of a
number of anticancer drugs that target DNA replication. Such
intercalation is expected to stabilize the left-handed conformation by restoring base stacking to some extent. Such stabilization
may have deleterious effects for cancer cells resulting in lethal
DNA rearrangements and may be potentially one of the sources
of the anticancer action of intercalating agents.

Protein and DNA Sample Preparation. The Zα domain of human ADAR1 was
expressed and purified as previously reported (17). The protein was concentrated by using Centricon filtration devices (Millipore) to a final concentration 10 mg∕mL in 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.0, 20 mM NaCl. Oligonucleotides
ACðCGÞ3 AðCGÞ3 and GTðCGÞ3 TðCGÞ3 were purchased by IDT (Coralville) and
resuspended in 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.0, 20 mM NaCl or in 10 mM Tris-HCl,
pH 7.0, 20 mM NaCl. The Hepes-free protein sample was prepared by dialysis
against a 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, and 20 mM NaCl solution. The duplex
(Z-Z DNA) was prepared by heating a stoichiometric mixture of the two oligonucleotides to 80 °C and leaving the sample to slowly cool for 12 h.
Crystallization, Data Collection, and Processing. The Zα∕Z-Z DNA complex was
obtained by mixing 0.8 mM Zα and 0.2 mM DNA duplex. The mixture was
incubated at room temperature for 1 h before crystallization trials. Best diffracting crystals were obtained, in two different conditions, by the hanging
drop vapor diffusion method at 20 °C, by using 1 μL of the mixture with 1 μL
of the reservoir solution (16% PEG 2000 monomethyl ether), 0.1 M Hepes, pH
7.0, 0.2 M ammonium acetate or 17% PEG 2000, 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 0.2 M
ammonium acetate. Platelet-like crystals were obtained in both conditions.
Then 20% PEG 400 was added as cryoprotectant, and the crystals were flashcooled in liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data were measured at 100 K at
the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble) on beam lines
ID23EH2 or ID14EH4 and at the Diamond Light Source. Two datasets were
collected from single crystals, grown with either Hepes or Tris as a buffer,
to 2.65 and 2.8 Å resolution, respectively. Diffraction data were processed
with MOSFLM/SCALA (25, 26) resulting in Rmerge 9.2 (Hepes) and 8.3
(Hepes-free). The crystals belong to the orthorhombic P21 21 21 space group
with similar unit cell parameters of a ¼ 30.67 Å, b ¼ 102.21 Å, c ¼ 105.89 Å,

(for the Hepes and Tris structure, respectively). See Table S1 for data collection and processing statistics.
Structure Determination. Zα∕Z-Z DNA structure was solved by molecular
replacement using a single Zα domain bound to a single strand ðCGÞ3 oligonucleotide (PDB ID code 1QBJ) as a search model using the program PHASER
(27). We were able to identify four molecules in the asymmetric unit. The
structure was refined with PHENIX (28) and model building was carried
out by using COOT (29). The structure in the presence of Hepes was refined
at 2.65 Å to a final Rfactor of 0.23 (Rfree 0.28), whereas the structure in the
presence of Tris was refined at 2.8 Å and to a final Rfactor of 0.23 (Rfree
0.27). Noncrystallographic symmetry was used throughout the refinement
process relating portions of the four Zα monomers. Excellent quality electron
density was observed for all protein residues except the C-terminal residues
V199-Q202 (for all chains) and the solvent exposed side chains of Q141, K145,
E152, K170, and K187, which were not visible in electron density maps. No
density was observed also for the two DNA overhanging bases. Respectively,
94.4% and 91.8% of the residues belong to the most favored Ramachandran
plot regions for the Hepes and Tris structures. All other residues are found
allowed regions of the plot. The two structures have been deposited to
the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics database with
PDB ID codes 3IRQ and 3IRR (Hepes). Analysis of the Z-DNA helix parameters
was performed with 3DNA (30).
CD Spectroscopy. CD measurements were performed by using a Jasco J-815 CD
system in a 0.1-mm cuvette. We mixed 5–10 μM of the ZZ-DNA duplex with
different concentrations of Zα to final molar ratios of 1∶0, 1∶1, 1∶2, 1∶4, and
1∶6. Kinetics of the B → Z conversion were followed at single wavelength
(254 nm) and CD spectra were collected in 1-nm steps from 230 to
330 nm after 10 min of incubation when absorbance changes reach plateau.
Experiments were performed at 25 °C in 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.0, 20 mM NaCl or
10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 20 mM NaCl.
