ost double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viruses package their
genome into preformed protein shells in an active manner
using virally encoded molecular motors, as in tailed dsDNA bacteriophages (1, 2), herpesviruses (3), adenoviruses (4), and poxviruses (5). In tailed dsDNA bacteriophages and herpesviruses, the
newly synthesized viral DNA in host cells exists as tandem concatemers, each composed of multiple copies of unit-length genome
(6, 7). The viral DNA-packaging motor (also known as terminase
large subunit or large terminase) cleaves concatemeric viral DNA
into units of or near the genomic length and pumps each into
a preformed capsid precursor termed procapsid powered by ATP
hydrolysis (2, 6, 8).
The DNA-packaging motors of dsDNA bacteriophages package
DNA highly densely into the capsid, resulting in an internal pressure
of as high as 50 atmospheres, more than 10 times that found in any
other living system (9, 10). These molecular motors can work
against a force larger than 50 pN and package DNA at high rates,
placing them among the most powerful molecular motors in nature
(9, 11). Most phage DNA packaging motor proteins are bifunctional
enzymes that integrate two types of enzymatic activities, the ATPase
and the nuclease, as required by the concatemeric nature of the
packaging substrates. Resolving DNA concatemers into units and
packaging into procapsid must be precisely coordinated, and the
nuclease activity may only be activated at the initiation step of DNA
packaging and upon completion of each packaging cycle.
Structures of phage T4 terminase large subunit gp17 revealed an
ATPase domain belonging to the additional-strand catalytic glutamate (ASCE) superfamily, and a model for DNA translocation
dependent on electrostatic forces was proposed (12, 13). Nevertheless, this model was not supported by the structure of phage SPP1
G2P nuclease domain, as the proposed secondary DNA-binding
surface during DNA translocation was not conserved among phage
terminases (14). Moreover, due to the double mutation in the
ATPase active site that rendered the protein inactive in ATP hydrolysis and DNA packaging, further studies are needed to clarify if
these structures represented functional states (13). A central question in understanding functions of the ASCE superfamily ATPases
www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1301133110

is chemomechanical coupling, that is, how the chemical reaction of
nucleotide hydrolysis is translated into physical motion, which has
been studied intensively for nucleic acid helicases and translocases
involved in a broad range of cellular and viral processes (reviewed in
refs. 15–17). However, the chemomechanical coupling mechanism
in viral terminases and how it is coordinated with the nuclease activity have not been well understood.
Here we report the 1.69-Å resolution structure of the DNApackaging motor of Sf6, a dsDNA bacteriophage that belongs to
the Podoviridae family. The structure reveals an N-terminal RecAlike ATPase domain and a C-terminal RNase H-like nuclease
domain tethered by a regulatory linker domain. The domain arrangement is completely distinct from that observed in the mutated,
inactive version of phage T4 terminase, leading to a DNA-binding
surface different from that proposed in T4 (13). The structures
in complex with nucleotides reveal the ATPase active center
ﬂanked by the ATPase domain and the linker domain, differing
from T4 gp17. These results provide insights, at the atomic detail,
into the chemomechanical coupling and coordination of the
ATPase and nuclease activities in a viral DNA-packaging motor,
and suggest a DNA-packaging model different from that proposed
for phage T4.
Results and Discussion
Overall Structure and Domain Arrangement. Crystallization of full-

length viral DNA-packaging motor proteins has been difﬁcult as
reported for phage T4 (13), phage P22 (18) and a herpesvirus (19),
and it was only possible to crystallize and solve the structure of T4
gp17 with double mutations in the ATPase domain active center
(D255E/E256D) and a 43-residue truncation at the C terminus,
which rendered the protein inactive in ATP hydrolysis and DNA
packaging (13). We have been able to crystallize the full-length,
wild-type gp2. For successful crystallization, ADP was added at an
early step of protein puriﬁcation. ADP is not observed in the electron density map in the native gp2 structure.
The structure of gp2 shows an N-terminal ATPase domain
(residues 3–172) sitting on top of the C-terminal nuclease domain
(residues 211–465), resembling a golf ball on the tee (Fig. 1 and
Fig. S1A). The ATPase and nuclease domains are connected by
a 38-residue linker domain (residues 173–210). The overall dimension of the molecule is 98 × 54 × 51 A3. The linker domain
associates more closely with the ATPase domain, with a buried
solvent accessible surface area of 1197.22 Å2 and 343.65 Å2 with
the ATPase and nuclease domains, respectively.

BIOCHEMISTRY

Many DNA viruses use powerful molecular motors to cleave concatemeric viral DNA into genome-length units and package them into
preformed procapsid powered by ATP hydrolysis. Here we report
the structures of the DNA-packaging motor gp2 of bacteriophage
Sf6, which reveal a unique clade of RecA-like ATPase domain and an
RNase H-like nuclease domain tethered by a regulatory linker domain, exhibiting a strikingly distinct domain arrangement. The gp2
structures complexed with nucleotides reveal, at the atomic detail,
the catalytic center embraced by the ATPase domain and the linker
domain. The gp2 nuclease activity is modulated by the ATPase domain and is stimulated by ATP. An extended DNA-binding surface is
formed by the linker domain and the nuclease domain. These results
suggest a unique mechanism for translation of chemical reaction
into physical motion of DNA and provide insights into coordination
of DNA translocation and cleavage in a viral DNA-packaging motor,
which may be achieved via linker-domain–mediated interdomain
communication driven by ATP hydrolysis.

ASCE family, the Sf6 gp2 ATPase domain core contains a ﬁvestranded, parallel β-sheet sandwiched between several α-helices
(Fig. 2A). To understand mechanisms of ATP hydrolysis and chemomechanical coupling, we have solved the structures of gp2 in
complex with ATP, a nonhydrolyzable analog ATP-γ-S, and ADP
at 3.05-, 1.89- and 2.09-Å resolutions, respectively (Fig. 2 and
Table S1).
The gp2:ATP-γ-S structure shows excellent electron density for
the bound ATP-γ-S and a Mg2+, whereas the base and sugar
portions of ATP is less well deﬁned in the gp2:ATP structure (Fig.
2 C–E and Fig. S2A). In both structures, the bound nucleotides are
situated in a groove embraced by the ATPase and the linker

Fig. 1. The overall structure of gp2. The structure is shown as a ribbon diagram rainbow colored from the N- (blue) to C terminus (red). The ATPase
active site in the N-terminal domain is indicated by a red dashed ellipsoid,
with Walker A and B motifs in magenta and red, respectively. The linker
domain is indicated by a black dashed curve. The active site of the C-terminal
nuclease domain is indicated by a blue dashed ellipsoid, with the three active
acidic residues in magenta. Also shown are side chains of residues K28, S29,
R24, E118, and E119 in the N-terminal domain; E187 in the linker domain
that interacts with R24; and D244, D296, and D444 in the C-terminal domain.
Black arrows indicate the openings of the ATPase active site and the nuclease active site in the two views. The N- and C termini are indicated.

When the gp2 structure is viewed such that the ATPase active
center faces the front, the nuclease active center of the C-terminal
domain points to the right, representing an orientational difference
of approximate 90° for the two active centers (Fig. 1, Left). The
ATPase active center is ﬂanked by the ATPase domain core and the
linker domain, forming a crevice that extends up toward the N
terminus of the protein and down toward the nuclease active site
(Fig. 1). The gp2 structure shows a domain arrangement completely
different from that of phage T4 gp17 (Fig. S1B). When the two
structures are superimposed according to the nuclease domain, the
ATPase domain of gp2 extends to a direction opposite to that in T4
gp17 (Fig. S1B). It is not possible for gp2 to adopt the same domain
arrangement as T4 gp17, as it would cause penetration of a hairpin
in the nuclease domain into the ATPase domain. In addition, the
ATP-binding pocket in T4 gp17 faces upward away from the nuclease domain, whereas that in Sf6 gp2 faces front (Fig. S1B). As
a result, the N-terminal ATPase active site and the C-terminal
nuclease active site in gp2 are apparently positioned in close
proximity, connected via the linker domain (Fig. 1). As the T4 gp17
structure contained two mutations in the ATPase active site and the
C-terminal 43-residue truncation, which rendered the protein inactive, it is hard to assess if the domain arrangement was affected by
the mutations or represented any speciﬁc functional state (13).
Moreover, the DNA-binding mode for the nuclease domain proposed based on the T4 gp17 structure (20) would lead to a severe
clash of DNA with the linker domain, raising questions about the
physiological relevance of the domain arrangement in the T4 gp17
structure. Indeed, we observe as large as 4 Å offset between the
bound ATP and a 3 Å offset between the Walker A motifs in the Sf6
gp2 and T4 gp17 structures (see below and Fig. S2C). Thus, the Sf6
gp2 structure represents a snapshot of a wild-type, full-length viral
DNA-packaging terminase.
N-Terminal ATPase Domain and ATPase Active Center. The N-terminal
domain displays a canonical ASCE fold that is commonly observed
in ATPases such as RecA, F1-ATPase, and DNA/RNA helicases
and translocases (15, 17) (Fig. 2). Like other members of the

Conformational Change of the Linker Domain Associated with
Nucleotide Binding and Hydrolysis. Comparison of the structures of

native gp2 and in complex with ATP and ATP analogs shows
structural variances for the linker domain (Fig. S2 D and E). The
ATPase domains in these structures are virtually identical as evidenced by average rms deviation as small as 0.18 Å for Cα superposition (residues 9–172), whereas the linker domains show
apparent movement. Notably, the helix α6 (residues 181–194)
undergoes an overall movement of up to 0.5 Å (measured between
the gp2:ADP and gp2:ATP structures). This conformational change
is mediated by interaction between residue R24 from the Walker
motif and E187 from the linker domain (see below). A positional
change in such a scale, although subtle, cannot be explained by
experimental error, given the sufﬁciently high resolution of the
Zhao et al.

structures. This suggests that the linker domain can undergo conformational change associated with different substrate-binding/
hydrolysis states of the ATPase active site. The motion of the linker
domain may serve to translate the chemical reaction of the ATP
hydrolysis into physical motion, thus providing a structural basis for
the chemomechanical coupling. It was estimated using in vitro
packaging systems of the phages phi29 and T3 motors that 2 bp were
packaged per ATP hydrolysis (21, 22). Single-molecule studies of
phi29 DNA-packaging motor showed that DNA packaging proceeded with a 10-bp step size, which was composed of four smaller
substeps of ∼2.5 bp each (23). These observations suggest that each
ATP hydrolysis event would lead to a movement of ∼7 Å for DNA.
Hence, the subtle conformational change of the linker domain observed in our structures must be converted to the larger step size of
DNA movement through, for example, product release and/or intermolecular interaction of the putative ring-like assembly of the
DNA-packaging motor proteins. Additionally, the movement of the
linker domain is accompanied by a comparable movement of 0.7 Å
of the nuclease domain. It is likely that the coordinated movement
of the linker and the nuclease domains may together lead to DNA
translocation, given that both domains participate in formation of
the putative DNA-binding surface (see below).
Role of Residue R24 in Triggering ATP Hydrolysis and Chemomechanical
Coupling. The core of the gp2 ATPase domain is readily superim-

posable with those of helicases and nucleic acid translocases, which
shows that residue R24 is located essentially at the same positions
as the arginine ﬁngers in those motor proteins (24–26) (Fig. S2 F–I).
This suggests that R24 acts as the arginine ﬁnger in gp2. Conserved
arginine residues, generally termed arginine ﬁngers, are key features of the ASCE family of motor proteins, and movement of these
residues before and after ATP hydrolysis has been suggested to be
the molecular determinants for triggering mechanical motion (16,
24–26). In the gp2:ATP-γ-S structure, the side chain guanidinium
group of residue R24 is in close proximity to the γ-phosphate of
ATP-γ-S at a distance of 3.69 Å, and meanwhile is H-bonded to the
side chain carboxyl group of residue E187 from the linker domain
(Fig. 2D and Fig. S2E). In the gp2:ATP structure, the R24 side
chain is disordered. In the gp2:ADP structure, the R24 moves up by
∼0.4 Å and the rotamer conﬁguration of the E187 side chain
changes by ∼90°, altering the H-bonding pattern with R24, which
correlates with the movement of the linker domain (Fig. S2E).
These results suggest that the conformation of the R24 side
chain in the gp2:ATP-γ-S structure represents a state before ATP
hydrolysis. During ATP hydrolysis, the side chain guanidinium
group of R24 may transiently ﬂip toward the γ-phosphate of ATP,
generating an appropriate electrostatic niche as required to stabilize the transition state for ATP hydrolysis. The ﬂipping of R24
side chain would break the H bond with residue E187 in the linker
domain, weakening interdomain interaction and triggering motion
of the linker domain. After ATP hydrolysis, the R24 side chain may
ﬂip back to E187, facilitating product release and returning the
linker domain to the original conformation. This type of movement of R24 is evidenced by the observation that the R24 side
chain is well ordered in the structures complexed with ATP-γ-S
and ADP, but is disordered in the gp2:ATP structure.
Thus, each cycle of ATP binding, hydrolysis, and product release
would result in ﬂipping of the R24 side chain and breaking and
reformation of the H bond with E187, which leads to mechanical
motion presumably through the conformational change of the
linker domain. Comparison of the structures of gp2:ATP-γ-S,
gp2:ATP, and gp2:ADP suggests that the R24 side chain ﬂips away
from residue E187 toward the nucleotide substrate during ATP
hydrolysis and ﬂips back to residue E187 during release of the
product phosphate but before release of the other product ADP.
Thus, the putative conformational change in the linker domain
caused by R24 side chain ﬂipping occurs during ATP hydrolysis
and release of the product phosphate, but before release of the

domain, differing from T4 gp17 in which the linker domain showed
little interaction with bound nucleotides in the ATPase active site.
The high-resolution structure of gp2:ATP-γ-S allows accurate
revelation, at atomic detail, of the bound substrate, the catalytically essential Mg2+ cofactor and the water network as well as the
Walker A and B motifs that together form the active center (Fig.
2). The triphosphate groups of the bound ATP-γ-S make abundant
H bonds with the Walker A motif, whereas the adenine base is
sandwiched between the aromatic rings of residues W30 and
H179 (Fig. 2D and Table S2), which adopt conformations different
from that in the native gp2 structure, indicating induced ﬁt upon
substrate binding (Fig. S2B). A magnesium ion is situated next to
the nucleotide with a nearly perfect, six-member, octahedral coordination with the β and γ oxygen atoms of the bound ATP-γ-S,
the side chain oxygen of residue S29 within the Walker A motif,
and three water molecules, which are located at distances of 2.11,
2.10, 2.32, 2.08, 2.22, and 2.63 Å, respectively. These lengths are
approximate to the typical distance of ∼2.1 Å for Mg2+ coordination. One of the water molecules is H-bonded to the side
chain of residue E118 in the Walker B motif, thus may be polarized
for nucleophilic attack on the bound substrate. The side chain
amino group of residue K28 in the Walker A motif is H bonded to
two oxygen atoms from the β and γ phosphate groups of the bound
substrate, respectively. The main chain nitrogen atom of residue
G25 of the Walker A motif is H bonded to the oxygen atom that
connects the β and γ phosphorus, thus may play a role in
bond breakage.
Structural superposition reveals as large as 4 Å offset for the
bound ATP molecules and a 3 Å offset for the Walker A motifs
between the Sf6 gp2 and the previously reported phage T4 gp17
structures (Fig. S2C), which may reﬂect alterations of the T4
gp17 active site structure due to mutations of the two acidic
residues in the Walker B motif that render gp17 inactive (13).
Additionally, the catalytically essential Mg2+ is missing in the T4
gp17 structures (12, 13). Thus, the gp2:ATP-γ-S structure reveals
the conformation of the ATPase active center of a wild-type,
active viral DNA-packaging motor, mimicking the state in which
the ATP substrate is bound but before hydrolysis, which was not
seen in the previous T4 gp17 structures.
In the gp2:ADP structure, ADP occupies essentially the same
position as ATP-γ-S (Fig. 2F and Fig. S2A). The Mg2+ and the
coordinating water molecules are absent, resulting in altered
interactions between ADP and the protein. The location corresponding to the γ phosphate in the gp2:ATP-γ-S structure is occupied by a water molecule. The most noticeable difference from
the gp2:ATP-γ-S structure is that the side chain of residue E118 in
the Walker B motif ﬂips away from ADP and makes a salt bridge
with the side chain guanidinium group of residue R51 (Fig. 2F).
These observations suggest a sequential release of the ligand and
products after ATP hydrolysis, that is, Mg2+ and the inorganic
phosphate may leave the active site before release of ADP. Thus,
the gp2:ADP structure may represent a state in the halfway through
product releasing.

other product ADP. This correlates well with the previous singlemolecule studies on phage phi29 DNA packaging motor (27),
which showed that DNA translocation took place after ATP
binding but before release of the other product ADP, most likely
during release of the phosphate product. Our results provide a
structural basis for such an intricate phenomenon at atomic detail.
Sequence alignment showed that this arginine is nearly absolutely
conserved among viral terminases, but is absent in all helicases and
polypeptide translocases (28), thus representing a structural signature in viral terminases. Consistently, the corresponding residue
R162 in phage T4 gp17 exhibits strict essentiality for DNA packaging and deﬁciency in ATP hydrolysis (13, 29) and was proposed to
be the arginine ﬁnger in the T4 gp17 structure (13).

Viral DNA-Packaging Motors May Represent a Unique Clade of Nucleic
Acid Translocases. In other DNA/RNA helicases and translocases,

the ATPase active center comprises the Walker A and B motifs
from one protein subunit, and the arginine ﬁnger is typically from
a neighboring protein subunit. In contrast, the R24 in gp2 is located in the same protein subunit as the Walker A and B motifs,
and is immediately (a few residues) upstream of the Walker A
“Gly-Lys-Ser” motif in the amino acid sequence. Moreover, the
gp2 ATPase domain contains three additional β-strands and an
α-helix that are not present in the typical ASCE fold and have not
been observed in other ASCE family ATPases (Fig. 2 A and B).
These additional β-strands join the core fold to form an eightstranded β-sheet. This structural feature is also present in the phage
T4 gp17 (Fig. S2C) (12, 13). These structural elements are located
distal to the ATP active site and may potentially be involved in
terminase-speciﬁc molecular interactions. Based on these, we
propose that the viral DNA-packaging motor proteins represent
a unique clade of nucleic acid translocases because of protein folds
and mechanisms of chemomechanical coupling. An interesting
feature of viral DNA-packaging motor proteins is that they represent one of the most powerful biological molecular motors and can
work against a large force (9, 11). Such a feature must be encoded
in the protein structures and is likely linked to the overall fold and
the unique location of the arginine ﬁnger in viral terminases.
Nuclease Active Site of the C-Terminal Domain Is Adjacent to the
Linker Domain. Terminases contain a nuclease domain that is re-

sponsible for cleavage of viral DNA concatemer into genomelength units. Despite low sequence identity (<15%), the gp2
C-terminal domain exhibits a fold that not only is homologous to
viral terminase nuclease domain structures (13, 14, 18, 19), but also
clearly resembles those of a large group of nucleases such as
RNases H, topoisomerases, integrases, and DNA/RNA polymerases, which use similar metal-ion catalytic mechanisms (30,
31). (Fig. 3A). The three catalytically essential residues, D244,
D296, and D444, are located in a groove on the surface of the
molecule, making a network of H bonds with solvent molecules
(Fig. 3A and Fig. S3). The D244A mutation eliminates the gp2
nuclease activity (Fig. S4B). Helix α16 forms a lid on top of the
nuclease active center. That helix is also in direct contact with the
linker domain, suggesting communication between the ATPase
and nuclease active centers via the linker domain.
Nuclease Domain and Linker Domain Together Form the DNA-Binding
Surface. The gp2 must bind to DNA during two molecular events:

insertion of DNA into the capsid and cleavage of DNA once the
capsid is ﬁlled with DNA. No direct structural data have been
available thus far regarding how DNA binds to terminase large
subunits. Inspection of the electrostatic potential surface of gp2
reveals a contiguous, positively charged molecular surface that
spans a region surrounding the nuclease active site and extends to
the linker domain, which is the only surface area concentrated with
positively charged residues and thus may serve as the DNA-binding surface (Fig. S3). A collection of positively charged residues

contributes to this molecular surface (Fig. 3B). We have constructed
a model for DNA binding of gp2 by superimposing the gp2 nuclease
domain with RNase H in complex with a DNA:RNA hybrid (PDB
code 2QKK) (32) and replacing the nucleic acid with dsDNA (Fig.
3B and Fig. S3). The resultant DNA ﬁts well onto that positively
charged surface. Helix α16 appears to ﬁt with the DNA major
groove, with residues K432 and K434 interacting with the DNA
phosphate backbone. Positively charged residues K192, R193, and
R200 from the linker domain also make contact with the DNA
phosphate backbone. Preceding the helix α16 is a hairpin structure
that is conserved among viral terminase nuclease domains, and such
structural elements in phages SPP1 and P22 were proposed to
mediate interaction with DNA (14, 18). In our model, that hairpin is
also involved in interaction with the docked DNA through residue
K416. These results suggest that the nuclease domain and the linker
domain together form the DNA-binding surface.

have analyzed the in vitro nuclease activities of the full-length
gp2 and the isolated gp2 nuclease domain (gp2-CTD). Both

Implications for Viral DNA Packaging. Our structural analysis reveals
the detailed architecture of the wild-type, full-length DNApackaging motor gp2 consisting of an N-terminal RecA-like
ATPase domain and a C-terminal RNase H-like nuclease domain
connected by a linker domain. The domain arrangement is completely different from the previously reported structure of the
double-mutated, inactive version of T4 gp17. The linker domain is
engaged in ATP binding and hydrolysis, makes intimate contact
with helix α16 adjacent to the nuclease active center, and participates in formation of an extended DNA-binding surface. These
observations indicate that the linker domain plays a multitude of
regulatory roles in gp2 function.
These results suggest a model for DNA packaging by gp2 (Fig. 4).
During the progression of DNA translocation, the DNA binds to
the extended DNA-binding surface formed by the linker domain
and the nuclease domain. The gp2 may toggle between two states:
a prehydrolysis state, and an ATP-hydrolysis state. In the prehydrolysis state, the arginine ﬁnger (residue R24) ﬂips away from the
bound ATP γ-phosphate and makes a H bond with the E187 in the
linker domain, as observed in the gp2 structure. Once ATP binds to
the ATPase active site, the R24 swings back to the ATP γ-phosphate, triggering ATP hydrolysis, which is followed by release of the
product inorganic phosphate and ADP. These result in breaking of
the H bond with E187, leading to conformational change of the
linker domain and thus mechanical motion of the bound DNA,
which drives DNA into the capsid. During DNA translocation, the
gp2 nuclease domain may not be functioning, due to potential
regulatory mechanisms such as intersubunit interaction as gp2 may
form a ring-like oligomer as in phages T4 and phi29 (see below),
differential ATP-binding states of motor protein subunits within
the potential oligomer (23), signaling through the portal protein
where gp2 is attached (35), or fast movement of DNA that prevents

Fig. 4. Model for chemomechanical coupling and coordination of DNA
translocation and cleavage in Sf6 gp2. (Left and Center) During DNA translocation, gp2 begins with ATP binding. The arginine ﬁnger then ﬂips toward
the bound ATP and induces ATP hydrolysis and product releasing, which
triggers conformational change of the linker domain, leading to physical
motion of DNA. Toggling of gp2 between the prehydrolysis and ATP hydrolysis states results in processive DNA translocation. (Right) When the
capsid is ﬁlled with DNA, additional conformational change may be conferred on gp2, exposing the nuclease active site to DNA and resulting in DNA
cleavage. Only one molecule of gp2 is shown, although gp2 may form a ringlike oligomer, and the directionality of the packaging motor with respect to
the DNA is not known and is shown schematically.

formation of a stationary terminase:DNA complex required for the
nucleolytic reaction (2). When the capsid is ﬁlled with DNA, the
DNA translocation is stalled, and the gp2 nuclease is activated,
leading to DNA cleavage.
A DNA-packaging model driven by interdomain electrostatic
interaction was proposed, based on the phage T4 gp17 inactive
mutant structure (13). Our model differs from that of T4 gp17 in
two ways. First, a primary DNA-binding surface for the cleavage
mode and a secondary DNA-binding surface for the DNA translocation mode were proposed in the T4 gp17 model, and the protein
toggled between two states. In contrast, our model suggests a single,
united DNA-binding surface during DNA translocation and upon
completion of each DNA packaging cycle during which the nuclease
activity must be activated. This avoids the drastic reorientation of
the nuclease domain by ∼90° that was needed to switch between the
primary and secondary DNA-binding surfaces in the T4 gp17
model, which seemed unlikely and might be contradictory to the
ring-like gp17 assembly where the nuclease domain took a major
part in intermolecular interaction (13). Indeed, the secondary
DNA-binding surface proposed for T4 gp17 may not be a conserved feature among phage terminases, as Smits and coworkers
reported that the phage SPP1 terminase G2P nuclease domain
did not possess those basic residues that formed the secondary
DNA-binding surface proposed in T4 gp17 (14). Second, the
DNA translocation in our model results from motion of the linker
domain triggered by ATP hydrolysis, in contrast to the proposed
mechanism for T4 gp17 in which the electrostatic interaction
between the ATPase domain and the nuclease domain drives the
DNA movement. It is not possible for Sf6 gp2 to adopt the same
domain arrangement as in T4 gp17, as a hairpin would penetrate
into the ATPase domain (see above and Fig. S1B). Hence, the
interdomain interface that is critical for the T4 gp17 model may
not exist in Sf6 gp2.
Cryo-EM analysis of T4 procapsid:gp17 complexes showed
a ring-like pentameric assembly of gp17 upon docking onto the
portal vertex of the procapsid (13). In phage phi29, the terminase
also assembles into a pentameric ring (36). Such a ring-like assembly is not observed in gp2 crystals, and gp2 exists as a monomer
in solution as T4 gp17 does. It is likely that the assembly of those
viral DNA-packaging motor proteins into high-order oligomers
is dependent on other factors such as the portal protein, the

proteins show nonsequence-speciﬁc nuclease activity, and both
are weak nucleases as evidenced by a large excess of protein over
DNA and an extended incubation time used in those assays (Fig.
S5 and Materials and Methods). However, the full-length gp2
shows weaker nuclease activity than gp2-CTD at the room
temperature, suggesting that the presence of the ATPase and the
linker domains confers an inhibitory effect on the nuclease domain (Fig. S5A). ATP drastically increases the nuclease activity
(Fig. S4A), whereas ADP and nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs
ATP-γ-S and AMP-PNP do not show such an enhancing effect
(Fig. S5C). Higher temperature considerably enhances the nuclease activity of the full-length gp2, whereas the gp2-CTD activity remains essentially unchanged (Fig. S5B). These data
suggest that the gp2 ATPase and linker domains inhibit the
C-terminal domain nuclease activity, presumably by formation of
an extended DNA-binding surface as described above, which may
favor more stable DNA binding but reduce the turnover rate of
the reaction, as a fast reaction requires both substrate DNA
binding before cleavage and DNA product releasing after cleavage.
ATP hydrolysis at the ATPase domain may induce conformational
change or motion on the linker domain as described above, thus
causing rearrangement of the DNA-binding surface and help release the product DNA, resulting in an increased turnover rate of
the reaction. It is worth pointing out that ATP binding alone may
not be sufﬁcient for such an effect and ATP hydrolysis is required,
as ATP-γ-S and AMP-PNP do not show the stimulating effect. This
type of mechanism is conﬁrmed by the nuclease activity assay at
37 °C, in which higher temperature may increase domain motion,
thus increasing the turnover rate of the nucleolytic reaction. Such
a mechanism, which is stimulating the reaction by enhancing
nucleic acid product release via domain rearrangement, is similar
to that proposed in RNA helicases (33, 34). These results indicate
that the presence of the N-terminal ATPase domain modulates the
C-terminal domain nuclease activity, which may be mediated by the
linker domain and driven by ATP hydrolysis.

terminase small subunits, DNA, and ATP. The structural similarity
between the gp2 ATPase domain and the ASCE family nucleic acid
helicases/translocases further implies that the viral DNA-packaging
motors may assemble into ring-like oligomers similar to those observed in dsDNA translocation protein FtsK (37) and RNA packaging motor P4 of phage phi12 (25). These suggest an evolutionary
lineage among viral genome-packaging motor proteins, which may
also be remotely linked to cellular nucleic acid translocases/helicases. Nevertheless, the dsDNA viruses such as tailed dsDNA bacteriophages and herpesviruses may have gained a nuclease module in
addition to the ATPase module during evolution, allowing elegant
coupling of packaging and cleavage of concatemeric viral DNA.

to 0.1 × 0.03 × 0.03 mm3 within a few weeks. Crystals were ﬂash frozen in
30% (wt/vol) ethylene glycol. X-ray data were collected at the Advanced
Photon Source (APS) and Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource
(SSRL) at the various stages of the project. The data used for the ﬁnal
structure determination of gp2 were collected at APS. Data were processed
with the program HKL2000 (38). Structures of the full-length Sf6 gp2 were
determined in combination with single-wavelength anomalous diffraction
and molecular replacement, and structures of gp2 in complex with ATP,
ATP-γ-S, or ADP were solved with molecular replacement using the native
gp2 structure as the search model (SI Text).
