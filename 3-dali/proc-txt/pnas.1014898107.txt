The DNA-dependent activator of IFN-regulatory factors (DAI), also
known as DLM-1/ZBP1, initiates an innate immune response by
binding to foreign DNAs in the cytosol. For full activation of the
immune response, three DNA binding domains at the N terminus
are required: two Z-DNA binding domains (ZBDs), Zα and Zβ, and an
adjacent putative B-DNA binding domain. The crystal structure of
the Zβ domain of human DAI (hZβDAI ) in complex with Z-DNA
revealed structural features distinct from other known Z-DNA
binding proteins, and it was classified as a group II ZBD. To gain
structural insights into the DNA binding mechanism of hZβDAI ,
the solution structure of the free hZβDAI was solved, and its bindings to B- and Z-DNAs were analyzed by NMR spectroscopy. Compared to the Z-DNA–bound structure, the conformation of free
hZβDAI has notable alterations in the α3 recognition helix, the
“wing,” and Y145, which are critical in Z-DNA recognition. Unlike
some other Zα domains, hZβDAI appears to have conformational
flexibility, and structural adaptation is required for Z-DNA binding.
Chemical-shift perturbation experiments revealed that hZβDAI
also binds weakly to B-DNA via a different binding mode. The
C-terminal domain of DAI is reported to undergo a conformational
change on B-DNA binding; thus, it is possible that these changes
are correlated. During the innate immune response, hZβDAI is likely
to play an active role in binding to DNAs in both B and Z conformations in the recognition of foreign DNAs.

D

NA can activate immune responses in the innate immune
system. Nonmethylated CpG sequences are recognized by
toll-like receptor 9, and this results in inducing type-I interferon
(IFN) (1). Double-stranded DNA, when placed in the cytosol of a
cell by invading microbes or left by incomplete clearance of DNA
damage, also can evoke immune responses (2–4). A recent study
demonstrated that, in addition, the DNA-dependent activator of
IFN-regulatory factors (DAI), formerly known as DLM-1 or ZBP1,
also detects cytosolic DNAs and activates the innate immune response (5). DAI mediates activation of the innate immune system
by facilitating DNA-mediated induction of type-I IFN and the expression of other related genes. DAI contains three DNA binding
domains in the N terminus: two Z-DNA binding domains (ZBDs),
Zα and Zβ, and an adjacent D3 region, a putative B-DNA binding
domain. The D3 region plays pivotal roles in DNA binding, but
all three domains are indispensable for the full activation of DAI
(6). An intriguing question in innate immunity is how diverse foreign
DNAs in the B- or Z-DNA conformations can be efficiently recognized by the DNA binding domains of DAI.
For the last decade there have been extensive structural and
biochemical studies on ZBDs. The editing enzyme ADAR1
(double-stranded RNA adenosine deaminase) was the first
Zα-containing protein to be identified. Zα domains were also
found in the vaccinia virus E3L protein (7) and in PKZ (protein
kinase containing Z-DNA binding domain). Crystal structures of
www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1014898107

the Zα domains of ADAR1, DAI, and Yaba-like pox disease virus
complexed with Z-DNAs have been reported (8–10). Solution
structures of the DNA-free Zα domain from human ZαADAR1
(hZαADAR1 ) and from vaccinia virus ZαE3L (vvZαE3L ) are also
available (11, 12). A typical Zα domain consists of an α þ β
helix-turn-helix motif and a β sheet. Z-DNA binding is mediated
by helix α3, called the recognition helix; the tyrosine residue in
the recognition helix is the centerpiece in this process. The β-loop
between strands β2 and β3 participates in Z-DNA binding in
conjunction with the recognition helix and forms the “wing”
structure. The wing contains conserved proline residues that
make hydrophobic contacts with the phosphate backbone of
Z-DNA.
Contrary to the wealth of structural information on Zα
domains, few studies have reported the structures of Zβ domains,
the second Z-DNA binding domains identified in ADAR1, DAI,
and PKZ. To date, the crystal structure of Zβ domain from human
ZβADAR1 is known (13), but it lacks the central tyrosine on the
recognition helix and does not have Z-DNA binding activity.
In contrast, the Zβ domain of human DAI (hZβDAI ) is unusual
because it has Z-DNA binding activity, despite the lack of some
residues that are known to be essential for Z-DNA binding in Zα
domains (7, 14). The recent crystal structure of hZβDAI ∕Z-DNA
complex revealed a unique mode of Z-DNA recognition (15), and
thus it is considered to be one of the group II ZBDs.
In order to gain further structural insights into the unusual
Z-DNA binding mode of hZβDAI , and to elucidate its DNA binding mechanism, we determined the solution structure of the
DNA-free hZβDAI and analyzed its binding to B- and Z-DNAs
using NMR spectroscopy. Here, we show that hZβDAI in solution
exhibits structural deviations from the crystal structure of the
complex, suggesting that hZβDAI undergoes conformational alterations upon DNA binding. In addition, residues involved in
the weaker B-DNA binding are revealed by chemical-shift perturbation (CSP) experiments, and its binding mode to B-DNA
is proposed. These results provide clues for understanding how
hZβDAI contributes to the recognition of foreign DNA in the
innate immune response.

of hZβDAI using NMR spectroscopy. The backbone RMSD of 20
lowest energy structures superimposed is 0.13  0.04 Å (Table S1
and Fig. S1). The overall fold of hZβDAI in solutions appears similar to other known ZBDs with the canonical α þ β helix-turnhelix motif consisting of three helices and three β-strands (called
“winged helices”) (Fig. 1A). The overall conformation of the
DNA-free hZβDAI is similar with those of hZαADAR1 and
vvZαE3L (Fig. 1B). Notable conformational differences are found
in the recognition helix (α3) and the wing (β2 and β3), as previously observed for the crystal structure of hZβDAI complexed
with Z-DNA, in comparison with other ZBD/DNA complexes
(15). It appears that the recognition helix of hZβDAI is bent with
a mixed conformation of 310 - and α-helices, rather than a straight
α-helix, and the tip of the wing is seen to pull out of the canonical
position critical in Z-DNA binding (Fig. 1B). The residual dipolar
coupling (RDC) experiments also confirmed that the DNA-free
hZβDAI has a bent helix rather than a straight helix (Table S2 and
Fig. S2). In this analysis, the RDC values calculated from a
modified structure containing the recognition helix in a straight
conformation showed larger deviations than those calculated
from the NMR or X-ray structures (Fig. S2).

Conformational Changes of hZβDAI upon Z-DNA Binding. From the
crystal and solution structures of hZαADAR1 , it is known that
Zα does not show any significant conformational changes upon
Z-DNA binding, which indicates that it is a prepositioned binding
surface for Z-DNA (11). However, hZβDAI shows notable
changes in the N-terminal region of the recognition helix (Fig. 2A
and Fig. S3). This suggests that conformational rearrangements
occur in the DNA-recognition regions upon DNA binding. Free
and DNA-bound hZβDAI commonly have a 310 -helix (T136–
D139) at the N-terminal end of the α3-helix; however, they display distinct conformations. Whereas the helicity of the recognition helix is well maintained in the free hZβDAI via hydrogen
bonds between the N-terminal 310 -helix and the C-terminal αhelix, the helicity is broken in the DNA-bound hZβDAI because
of the absence of such backbone hydrogen bonds (Fig. S3A) (15).
In the free hZβDAI , the backbone carbonyl oxygens of A137 and
K138 in the 310 -helix form hydrogen bonds with the side chain
and backbone NH groups of N141 in the α3-helix of 2.9 and
3.6 Å, respectively. But, in the case of the DNA-bound hZβDAI ,
the distance between the backbone carbonyl oxygen of K138 and
the backbone NH group of N141 is 4.1 Å, and the side chain NH
group of N141 no longer forms a hydrogen bond with A137
because of the interaction with DNA [Protein Data Bank (PDB)

Conformational Isomerization of the DNA-Free hZβDAI . The 1 H-15 N
heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectrum analysis of the free hZβDAI showed that there are more than two sets
of NMR signals, which indicates the existence of conformational
isomers (Fig. S4A). It was found by analysis of the nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy (NOESY) spectra that this
phenomenon is due to the cis-trans isomerization of proline
residues. Analysis of chemical-shift differences between the major and minor signals along the residues revealed that the differences are larger near the proline residue, P122 (Fig. S4B). The
large chemical-shift difference between major and minor signals
from I164 could also be explained by the fact that I164 is close to
P122 in three-dimensional space. To verify the presence of proline isomerization and test the functional role of this residue, the
P122 residue was mutated to alanine and its NMR spectrum and
Z-DNA converting activity were examined. Interestingly, the
minor signals from the wild-type hZβDAI were not seen in the
1
H-15 N HSQC spectrum of the P122A mutant (Fig. S4A), thereby
confirming that those signals were caused by the cis-trans isomerization of P122. However, P122A mutant did not show any
functional difference in terms of Z-DNA conversion activity measured by CD spectroscopy, compared to the wild-type protein
Kim et al.

(Fig. S4C). Those findings suggest that the proline isomerization
is not relevant to the Z-DNA converting activity of hZβDAI . Consistently, both cis- and trans-isomers were observed in the crystal
structure of the hZβDAI ∕Z-DNA complex (15). Therefore, it is
thought that both isomers are in equilibrium in solution and both
contribute to Z-DNA binding. RDC data also support the presence of the two isomers in solution; that is, the experimental
RDC value for E121 (4.0 Hz) is the middle of the calculated
RDC values of the trans-conformer (−0.7 Hz) and the cis-conformer (8.1 Hz). The mechanism underlying the enhancement of
Z-DNA conversion activity by proline isomerization and its
functional role remains to be studied.
CSPs upon B- and Z-DNA Binding. An intriguing question to ask is
how the ZBD converts B-DNA to Z-DNA. As for the role of
the ZBD in Z-DNA conversion, there have been different explanations. The ZBD might take an active part in Z-DNA conversion by binding to B-DNA first and initiating the conversion
process. Alternatively, the ZBD could be more passively involved; that is, it may bind to the preformed Z-DNA that might
be transiently formed by Brownian motion and shift the B–Z
equilibrium toward Z-DNA. In either case, the positively charged
surface of the ZBD is expected to be involved in DNA binding.
Regarding the role of DAI in the recognition of foreign DNA, it
was anticipated that the ZBD would bind to various conformations of DNA (5). To obtain structural insight into the B-DNA
binding mode of hZβDAI and possibly into the B-to-Z converting
mechanism, CSP experiments with hZβDAI were performed
in the presence of double-stranded ðdCdGÞ6 (referred to as
CG6), a Z-DNA forming sequence, and double-stranded
ðdCdCdGÞðdAdTÞ6 ðdCdGdGÞ (referred to as AT6), a B-DNA
forming one (Fig. 3 and Fig. S5). One-dimensional imino proton
NMR and CD spectroscopy confirmed that CG6 formed Z-DNA
upon the addition of hZβDAI (Fig. S5A) in the same way as
observed for hZαADAR1 (20). Whereas resonances of the imino
protons of CG6 changed during the titration of hZβDAI , AT6
showed no changes except the intensity reduction by the line
broadening effect of hZβDAI binding. The B-to-Z transition of
CG6 induced by hZβDAI binding was also monitored by CD spectra. The molar ellipticity exhibited significant alterations at 255
and 295 nm, which is characteristic of Z-DNA. However, no spectral change was observed in the case of AT6.
The CSPs for backbone amide signals in 1 H-15 N HSQC and
the aliphatic side chain signals in 1 H-13 C HSQC were quantified
and displayed on the ribbon models and surface diagrams of the
free hZβDAI , respectively (Fig. 3 A and B). When the protein is
bound to CG6 as a Z-DNA, the backbone amides of the residues
from T136 to R146 in the α3 helix showed significant perturbations. These results can be anticipated from the fact they are
located in the N-terminal region of the α3 recognition helix
and have critical roles in Z-DNA binding (Fig. 3A). Surprisingly,
A137–D143 were also strongly perturbed by AT6 as a B-DNA,
which suggests that they may be involved in binding to B-DNA
as well as to Z-DNA. Whereas the residues located in the N-terminal region of the α3 helix are important in the binding both CG6
and AT6, the backbone amide groups in the middle part of α3
helix (Y145, R146, and M147) and two β-strands (D154, D156,
K160, W162, T163, and Y165) region seem to have preference to
CG6 because they showed large CSP values only upon CG6 binding. In addition, residues 107–112 and 107–110 of α1 helix showed
perturbation in CG6 and AT6 binding, respectively. Together
with residue 126 of the α2 helix, the residues in the N-terminal
part of the α1 helix interact with both Z- and B-DNA nonspecifically. Overall, Z-DNA binding showed CSP in a larger area than
on B-DNA binding including the β-sheet, whereas B-DNA binding occurs mainly in the region near to the N-terminal of α3 helix.
The crystal structure of the hZβDAI ∕Z-DNA complex reveals a
noncanonical DNA binding mode in that the wing is pulled away

ID code 3EYI, chain A]. The conformational change of the 310 helix in the DNA-bound hZβDAI was also confirmed by measuring the distances between Cα atoms in the 310 -helix and the
α3-helix (Table S3). The solution conformation would not be favorable for Z-DNA interaction because K138 and R142, which
play a pivotal role in Z-DNA binding, point away from the
DNA backbone (Fig. S3B). However, Z-DNA binding causes
the extension of the N-terminal 310 -helix and the proper binding
of K138 and R142 to Z-DNA (Fig. S3A). It is thought that these
conformational changes could be occurring because the energy
gained by the interactions of K138, N141, and R142 with the
phosphate backbone of Z-DNA is more than the energy loss
caused by the dissociation of the hydrogen bond between the side
chain of N141 and the carbonyl group of A137 and the backbone
hydrogen bond in K138/N141.
The tyrosine residue in the recognition helix is also critical in
Z-DNA binding (8–12, 16). The conserved tyrosine confers CH-π
interactions with both the edge of the tryptophan residue (17) in
the β3-strand and the guanosine base in the syn-conformation in
Z-DNA. Although the conserved tyrosine was observed to be in
contact with Z-DNA in the Z-DNA complex structure of yatapox
virus ZαE3L (10), it was proposed that the conformation of the
vaccinia tyrosine residue in the free state vvZαE3L is strongly correlated with the lack of Z-DNA converting activity (12). Whereas
hZαADAR1 has a prepositioned tyrosine to interact with Z-DNA
even in the free state and shows high Z-DNA converting activity
(11), vvZαE3L has the solvent-exposed tyrosine conformation with
diverse rotamers, and its Z-DNA converting activity is reduced
(12) (Fig. 2B). In the free hZβDAI , the corresponding Y145 does
not overlap with that of the DNA-bound hZβDAI , but adopts a
conformation close to that of vvZαE3L (Fig. 2B). Therefore, it is
suggested that the nonprepositioned conformation of Y145 in
the free hZβDAI may be one of the reasons for the lower Z-DNA
converting activity of hZβDAI than that of hZαADAR1 . Consistently, hZβDAI appears to have lower binding affinity to Z-DNA
and slower kinetics in Z-DNA converting activity (18, 19) than
hZαADAR1 .
Overall, hZβDAI seems to have a more flexible binding surface
than hZαADAR1 . Among the nine residues of hZαADAR1 that are
directly involved in DNA contact in the crystal structure of the
complex, seven are already prepositioned in a free state (11).
However, in the case of hZβDAI , four out of six Z-DNA contacting residues (R124, K138, R142, and Y145) rearrange upon
Z-DNA binding, and only N141 and W162 are prepositioned
(Fig. 2C).

from the DNA (15). However, the hZβDAI mutant (E157A/
ΔQ158/ΔS159/K160A) showed dramatic decreases in both
Z-DNA binding and conversion activity (19). This observation
prompted us to hypothesize that the wing structure may be
involved in Z-DNA recognition to some extent via a mechanism
yet unknown. CSP experiments upon addition of CG6 revealed
significant changes in signals of both backbone atoms for the wing
residues, H151, D154, D156, K160, W162, and T163, and side
chain atoms from H151, M155, D156, E157, and W162, although
they are not in direct contact with Z-DNA in the complex structure (15) (Fig. 3 A and B and Fig. S6). These findings may be
explained by the fact that DNA binding could affect the magnetic
environment of the wing directly or indirectly. H151, which is
located near the hinge between α3 and the wing, showed altered
conformations in the free and the DNA-bound hZβDAI . Thus,
DNA-induced conformational changes in the wing might affect
the conformation of H151. The CSP of the side chain of M155
seems to be due to the CH-π or hydrophobic interaction of M155
with W162, a key residue in Z-DNA binding. Additionally, on
CG6 binding, R146 and D143 show large CSPs on both backbone
and side chain signals, which is consistent with the fact that these
two residues form a salt bridge upon Z-DNA binding (15). In the
free hZβDAI , they are not salt-bridged but exposed to the solvent,
as shown by their chemical-shift values, which are in the average
range. Intriguingly, although the backbone signals were not perturbed significantly, the side chains of Y145 and W162 showed
strong perturbation by the B-DNA binding as well as Z-DNA
binding, which implies that these side chains are closely involved
in the DNA contact before B–Z transition. This situation may
facilitate the conformational change of Y145 in B–Z transition,
resulting in the aromatic ring of Y145 positioned to have the
CH-π interactions with both the edge of the W162 and guanosine
base of Z-DNA.

Discussion
This study clearly demonstrated that hZβDAI undergoes conformational adaptations such as the movement of the wing and the
recognition helix upon Z-DNA binding. Such changes were not
expected because it was believed that ZBDs have a prefixed DNA
binding interface, as found for hZαADAR1 (11). In addition, Y145
is not prepositioned in hZβDAI . In the free state, Y145 of hZβDAI
interacts with the side chain of neighboring R146. Cζ of Y145 is
located near Cγ of R146 with a distance of 3.7 Å. Upon Z-DNA
binding, the aromatic ring of Y145 moves to become sandwiched
between the guanidine base of Z-DNA and the aromatic ring of
W162, forming two stabilizing CH-π interactions (17). This movement affects the side chains of W162 and M155, and, in turn, the
backbone of the wing from D154 to T163. In addition, the side
chain of H151 in the hinge region was affected because of
the movement of the wing region, resulting in large CSPs of the
NMR signals. A somewhat related conformational change might
take place when vvZαE3L binds to Z-DNA, as its analogous tyrosine is flipped away from its binding position in the free state
(12) (Fig. 2B).
Residues of hZβDAI involved in B-DNA binding were identified, and the mode of B-DNA binding was partially revealed.
Based on the CSP experiment with B-DNA, its B-DNA binding
mode may be related to the initial stage of the binding to Z-DNA
forming sequences in the B-conformation. The charged residues
in the N terminus of the α3 recognition helix may thus be important for the initial recognition of both B- and Z-conformations of
DNA. However, there were subtle differences in the CSPs of
B- and Z-DNA binding, which may be attributable to structural
differences in the two DNA forms. These results support the idea
that hZβDAI may have a unique B-DNA binding mode, distinct
from the binding to Z-DNA. The wing, which is essential for
Z-DNA binding, does not seem to be involved in binding B-DNA.
Lack of additional interacting regions other than the recognition

Materials and Methods
Protein Preparation. The Zβ domain (103–166) of human DAI (hZβDAI ) and
the double-stranded DNAs were prepared as described previously (15). Five
extra amino residues (98-Ser-His-Met-Ala-Ser-102) were inserted during cloning. To produce isotopic labeled hZβDAI , bacteria were grown in M9 medium
containing 1 g L−1 of 15 NH4 Cl and 2 g L−1 of 13 C-glucose (Cambridge Isotope
Laboratories). After purification using Ni-NTA and HiTrap SP columns
(GE Healthcare), double-labeled hZβDAI was dialyzed and concentrated in
the NMR buffer [10 mM 2-(N-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid (MES) pH
5.5, 10 mM NaCl]. The 15 N-labeled hZβDAI P122A mutant was also prepared
in the same manner as the wild-type hZβDAI .
NMR Spectroscopy. NMR experiments were carried out at 35 °C on a 2 mM 13 C,
15 N-labeled protein sample in the NMR buffer containing 10% D O on
2
Avance 900 MHz (Bruker). 1 H, 15 N, and 13 C-resonance assignments were obtained from the following three-dimensional heteronuclear correlation
experiments: CBCA(CO)NH, HNCACB, HN(CA)CO, HNCO, HN(CO)CA, HNCA,
HBHA(CO)NH, H(CCO)NH, C(CCO)NH, HCCH–correlation spectroscopy, and
HCCH–total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY). Distance restraints were

2D in-phase/antiphase 1 H-15 N transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy
spectra and 1 DCaCO in IPAP-J-HNCO-based three-dimensional experiment
(23, 24). NMR spectra were processed with NMRPipe (25) and analyzed
with SPARKY 3.110 (26). For 1D imino proton NMR, samples were prepared
by adding hZβDAI to 0.15 mM CG6 or AT6 dissolved in 10 mM MES pH 5.5,
50 mM NaCl to the indicated molar ratios of protein to DNA (P/N).
The NMR spectra was taken at 500 MHz NMR (Bruker), and processed by
SpinWorks 3.1.7 (27).
Structure Determination. Distance restraints were mainly derived from 3D
15 N- or 13 C-edited and 2D 1 H-1 H NOESY experiments. NOE assignment algorithm of CYANA 2.1 (28) performed both the structure calculation and the
assignment of NOE peaks automatically. A total of 1,897 NOE-based upper
distance restraints were gained. TALOS program (29) derived 110 backbone
torsion angle restraints from chemical shifts. We obtained hydrogen bond
restraints by H–D exchange experiment, and with these restraints, a total
of 100 structures without significant violations were generated by CYANA
2.1. The structures were further refined by AMBER 10 (30) using an all-atom
force field (ff99SB). The AMBER refinement consisted of three stages: 1,500
steps of energy minimization, 20-ps molecular dynamics, and 1,500 steps of
energy minimization. The best 20 structures were selected as a final ensemble. A structure closest to the lowest energy was employed as representative.
Final structures were well refined with a backbone and heavy atom RMSD of
0.13 and 0.69 Å, respectively, for residues 98–166. The structures also have
good geometry with 92.3% of residues in the most favored region of the
Ramachandran plot (Table S1) examined by PROCHECK (31). The N-terminal
10 residues were not well converged in the ensemble because of absence of
long-range NOE.
Isothermal Titration Calorimetry. The CG6 and AT6 were dialyzed in 10 mM
MES pH 5.5, 50 mM NaCl prior to the isothermal titration calorimetry experiments. The dissociation constant (K d ) for CG6 or AT6 was measured using a
VP-ITC (MicroCal) at 25 °C.
CD Spectroscopy. The conversion of B- to Z-DNA was monitored by CD spectroscopy as described in the previous work (15) with slight modifications in
10 mM MES pH5.5, 50 mM NaCl. The B-to-Z conversion kinetics of the
wild-type and P122A mutant were monitored using CG6 for 50 min at
255 nm at 25 °C in 10 mM MES pH 5.5, 150 mM NaCl.
CSP Experiment. We titrated 0.6 mM 15 N-labeled hZβDAI with CG6 and AT6 in a
concentration of 0.035 mM, 0.075 mM, and 0.15 mM, respectively. 1 H-15 N
HSQC spectra were collected for the backbone CSPs and 1 H-13 C constant time
version HSQC spectra for aliphatic side chain CSPs. Both of them were performed in 10 mM MES pH 5.5, 50 mM NaCl at 35 °C. NMR resonances of 15 N,
13 C hZβ
DAI were affected along with increasing CG6 and AT6, respectively, in
the following ways: (i) none or minimal change in chemical shift, (ii) vanished
signal through medium exchange binding pattern, and (iii) major perturbation of chemical shift. Chemical-shift differences were calculated using the
pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
following equations: Δδ ¼ ðΔHÞ2 þ ð0.2 × ΔNÞ2 for backbone amide signals,
pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
and Δδ ¼ ðΔHÞ2 þ ð0.5 × ΔCÞ2 for aliphatic side chain signals.

helix might explain the relatively low binding affinity and relative
nonspecificity of hZβDAI toward B-DNA. Indeed, the measurements of binding affinities by isothemal titration calorimetry
revealed significantly higher binding affinity for Z-DNA, with
K d values of 226 nM and 16 μM to CG6 and AT6, respectively
(Fig. S7 A and B). This result is consistent with the binding affinities estimated by CSPs. Binding to Z-DNA shows a slow to
medium exchange binding pattern, whereas binding to B-DNA
shows a fast exchange pattern (Fig. S5 B and C). Considering
the interacting residues involved in B-DNA binding, which were
identified from CSP experiments, hZβDAI could bind to the minor
groove in a nonspecific manner (Fig. S7C), whereas virtually all
B-DNA binding proteins bind to major grooves of B-DNA. In
this binding model, the residues with a large CSP are located
close to the phosphate backbone of B-DNA, which means that
hZβDAI can have access to DNAs in the B-conformation without
interacting with anything in the major groove. In the binding
model to the major groove (Fig. S7D), K160 and Y145 collide
with B-DNA, but R135 does not make any contact with it.
In the conversion mechanism to Z-DNA, when hZβDAI binds
to CG6 in the B-DNA conformation, it may play an active role in
initiating its conversion to the Z-DNA conformation. This is supported by the recent biophysical study of hZαADAR1 (20). In that
study, it was observed that the amounts of Zα-bound B-DNA and
Zα-bound Z-DNA are the same and in equilibrium when the
protein is limited. Then, the Z conformation of DNA is stabilized
by additional binding of Zα to Z-DNA (20). A crystal structure of
the B-DNA:Z-DNA junction revealed that at the junction one
base pair was broken, and the two bases were extruded on either
side of the DNA duplex (16). This base extrusion is likely to be
central to initiating Z-DNA formation. Could that process be
facilitated by B-DNA binding to ZBDs through its minor groove?
Clearly, this is an avenue for further research.
Considering the function of DAI in the recognition of foreign
DNA to boost the innate immune response (5), the conformational diversity and flexibility of hZβDAI may be an integral feature
in recognizing foreign DNAs in various conformations. Because
the domain on the C-terminal side of hZβDAI also undergoes a
conformational change on binding DNA (5), these changes may
be correlated. The current study contributes to understating the
role of DAI at the molecular level in the innate immune system.
