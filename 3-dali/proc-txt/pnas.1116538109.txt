The 26S proteasome, a molecular machine responsible for regulated protein degradation, consists of a proteolytic core particle
(20S CP) associated with 19S regulatory particles (19S RPs)
subdivided into base and lid subcomplexes. The assembly of 19S
RP base subcomplex is mediated by multiple dedicated chaperones. Among these, Hsm3 is important for normal growth and
directly targets the carboxyl-terminal (C-terminal) domain of Rpt1
of the Rpt1–Rpt2–Rpn1 assembly intermediate. Here, we report
crystal structures of the yeast Hsm3 chaperone free and bound
to the C-terminal domain of Rpt1. Unexpectedly, the structure of
the complex suggests that within the Hsm3–Rpt1–Rpt2 module,
Hsm3 also contacts Rpt2. We show that in both yeast and mammals, Hsm3 actually directly binds the AAA domain of Rpt2. The
Hsm3 C-terminal region involved in this interaction is required in
vivo for base assembly, although it is dispensable for binding Rpt1.
Although Rpt1 and Rpt2 exhibit weak afﬁnity for each other,
Hsm3 unexpectedly acts as an essential matchmaker for the
Rpt1-Rpt2-Rpn1 assembly by bridging both Rpt1 and Rpt2. In
addition, we provide structural and biochemical evidence on
how Hsm3/S5b may regulate the 19S RP association to the 20S
CP proteasome. Our data point out the diverse functions of
assembly chaperones.

T

he ubiquitin-proteasome system is a major proteolytic system
in the cytosol and nucleus of all eukaryotic cells that regulates
various essential cellular processes by degrading proteins, which,
in most cases, are conjugated to ubiquitin (1–3). The 26S proteasome, the most downstream element of this pathway, is responsible for protein degradation. It comprises the catalytic core
particle (20S CP) capped by one or two regulatory particles (19S
RPs or PA700 in mammals), forming RP1CP and RP2CP complexes, respectively (4). The 20S CP encloses the protease active
sites (5), whereas the 19S RP functions in substrate recognition,
deubiquitination, unfolding, and translocation into the 20S CP
and provides the ATP and ubiquitin dependence on the 20S CP
(reviewed in 2).
The 19S RP can be subdivided into two subcomplexes, namely,
the base and the lid. The subunit architecture of the 19S RP has
been further improved very recently (6, 7). The base contains six
homologous ATPase subunits of the AAA family (referred to as
Rpt1–6 in yeast) plus non-ATPase subunits: Rpn1, Rpn2, and
Rpn13 (reviewed in 8). By analogy to proteasome-activating
ATPase complexes in prokaryotes and archaeas, the 19S RP
ATPases are presumed to assemble into a six-membered ring
that directly abuts the 20S CP (reviewed in 8, 9). The Rpt1-Rpt5Rpt4-Rpt3-Rpt6-Rpt2 arrangement within the ring, ﬁrst proposed based on phylogenetic hypotheses (10), was recently experimentally conﬁrmed (11). Rpt subunits consist of a coiled coil
www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1116538109

(CC) segment and an OB-fold domain, followed by an AAA
ATPase domain (12, 13). The AAA ATPase domain comprises
the C domain, which is a four-helix bundle. Protruding from the
C domain is a ﬂexible segment known as the carboxyl-terminal
tail. The tails participate in 19S RP assembly in yeast and the 19S
RP-20S CP interaction, and some tails also participate in opening of the 20S CP channel (14–17).
Assembly of machineries as complex as the 26S proteasome is
a highly orchestrated multistep event ensuring precise subunit arrangement between paralogous subunits. Both speciﬁc intrinsic 20S
CP subunits and proteasome-dedicated chaperones assist 20S CP
assembling steps (reviewed in 8, 18). More recently, four distinct
dedicated chaperones (Hsm3/S5b, Nas2/p27, Nas6/p28 gankyrin,
and Rpn14/PAAF1) involved in the assembly of the base of the 19S
RP have been identiﬁed in both yeast (19–22) and mammals (19,
23). There are no obvious sequence similarities among the 19S RP
chaperones. Remarkably, these four factors were each shown to
bind the C domain of a speciﬁc Rpt subunit directly: Hsm3/S5b
binds Rpt1, Nas2/p27 binds Rpt5, Nas6/p28 gankyrin binds Rpt3,
and Rpn14/PAAF1 binds Rpt6. They participate in different assembly intermediates [Hsm3/S5b–Rpt1–Rpt2–Rpn1 (also referred
as the Hsm3 module), Nas2/p27–Rpt5–Rpt4, Nas6/p28–Rpt3, and
Rpn14/PAAF1–Rpt6 precursor]. Hence, every chaperone functions in distinct steps of base assembly, possibly associated with
different assembly pathways (reviewed in 24). Nearly all proteasomal 19S RP base subunits are essential for viability in yeast. In
contrast, each of the four base chaperones is dispensable in normal
conditions. However, among the single mutants, the absence of the
Hsm3 chaperone leads to the most severe growth phenotype and
displays signiﬁcant assembly defects (19, 20). Hsm3 displays other
speciﬁc features because it is the only chaperone that is part of
a precursor complex containing two ATPase subunits (Rpt1 and
Rpt2) plus a non-ATPase subunit (Rpn1).
The chaperones have been suggested to solubilize ATPase
subunits, provide stability, bring subassemblies together, or tem-

porally sequence the assembly process by restricting the accessibility of the Rpt C-termini to the 20S CP. To date, no 19S RP
chaperone has been found to bind two Rpt proteins; therefore,
they have not been considered to perform a scaffolding function
in assembly. Answering how these different chaperones assist in
assembly at the molecular level requires further data about their
structures and their interactions within the assembly precursors
of the 19S RP base.
Here, we gain further insights into the molecular mechanism
of the association between Hsm3 and Rpt1 by solving the crystal
structure of Hsm3 and the Hsm3–C-terminal domain of Rpt1
(Rpt1–Cter) complex. Extended to the Hsm3–Rpt1–Rpt2–Rpn1
precursor complex (also referred as the Hsm3 module), our
analysis reveals a tight network of direct interactions between
different regions of the subunits. Although the central part of
Hsm3 binds the Cter domain of Rpt1, the C-terminal part of
Hsm3 fully dispensable for Rpt1 binding, is required to interact
with the AAA domain of Rpt2. Despite the drastic sequence
divergence between both Hsm3 and its human ortholog [less
than 10% sequence identity (19)], S5b is also shown to contact
the human Rpt2 subunit directly. Moreover, we show that the Cterminal part of Hsm3 is required for normal growth and is essential to the formation of the Hsm3–Rpt1–Rpt2–Rpn1 precursor. Hence, Rpt1 binding is necessary but, unexpectedly, not
sufﬁcient for Hsm3 assembling function. We propose that
through its elongated structure, Hsm3 wears two hats, chaperoning the Rpt1 subunit to ensure folding and solubility and
acting as a major scaffold for the anchoring of Rpt1 to the Rpn1–
Rpt2 module.

Results
Overall Structure of Hsm3. We solved the crystal structure of the
recombinant yeast Hsm3 at a resolution of 2.1 Å using singlewavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) phasing (Fig. 1 and
Table S1). Eleven Arm/HEAT repeats, each composed of three
well-deﬁned helices (labeled αA, αA′, and αB) or two regular
antiparallel helices (labeled αA and αB), respectively, can be
clearly identiﬁed and are labeled R1–R11 (Fig. 1A and Fig. S1).
As expected, Arm/HEAT repeats extend over the whole sequence of Hsm3, except for 6 and 15 disordered residues absent
from the electron density map at the N terminus and C terminus,

respectively. The overall shape of Hsm3 is a curve-shaped
“croissant” with the dimensions 80 Å × 60 Å × 50 Å. The conservation of Hsm3 mapped at the surface of the X-ray structure
(Fig. 1B) was derived from a multiple sequence alignment
gathering all orthologs retrieved in eukaryotes and optimized
with respect to the 3D structure (Fig. S1). The convex face of the
croissant is poorly conserved. In contrast, a cluster of conserved
residues lies at the center of the concave face of the molecule
(Fig. 1B). This patch only covers part of the repeat R5, R6, and
R7 helices. Its center is made of exposed hydrophobic side chains
surrounded by a rim of charged residues. A second conserved
region can also be pinpointed at the surface of the C-terminal
repeats of Hsm3 (see below).
Structure of Hsm3 in Complex with the Cter Domain of Rpt1 ATPase.

We previously showed that Hsm3 speciﬁcally interacts with Rpt1
and, more precisely, with the last 90 C-terminal residues of the
ATPase subunit (19). The puriﬁed complex of the yeast Hsm3
protein (residues 1–480) and of the Cter domain of yeast Rpt1
ATPase (hereafter, Rpt1-C; residues 378–467) was ﬁrst obtained
using a coexpression method (19) but failed to produce any
crystal. Both partners were then produced as a unique fusion
protein. A 17-residue linker containing a PreScission (GE
Healthcare) protease recognition sequence was introduced between Hsm3 and Rpt1-C. The puriﬁed Hsm3–Rpt1-C fusion was
cleaved by the PreScission protease just before crystallization
trials. The Hsm3–Rpt1-C complex crystallized in space group
P6522 with two complex molecules in the asymmetrical unit that
diffracted up to a resolution of 3.8 Å. The structure was solved by
the molecular replacement method (Fig. 2A and Table S1) and
allowed unambiguous building of the four helices of the Rpt1-C
α-helical bundle (labeled α1–α4) (Fig. S2A). In the binding interface, the quality of the maps was sufﬁcient to adjust the orientation of a number of side chains conﬁdently, as illustrated by
the omit map of the sole α2 helix of Rpt1 (Fig. S2B). Three
helices of Rpt1-C (α1, α2, and α4) are involved in binding the
concave face of Hsm3 covering the central conserved patch of
the chaperone (Fig. 2A). The interaction buries a surface of
∼2,000 Å2 within the standard range of protein-protein interaction surfaces (25).
The structure of Rpt1-C within the complex is overall very
similar to that of other known structures of AAA ATPases, such
as Rpt3-C (yeast or human), archaea PAN, and Ftsh (rmsd of
1.37, 0.99, and 1.05 Å, respectively) (Fig. S2C). The major signiﬁcant deviation lies within the α1–α2 loop probably stabilized
by an intramolecular salt bridge between Arg403 and Glu440 in
Rpt1-C (Fig. S2C). Interestingly, residue Arg403 in Rpt1 contacts Asp230, a strictly invariant position of Hsm3 (see below;
Fig. 2B and Fig. S2B).
The binding interface is composed of a hydrophobic core
surrounded by polar and charged interactions. The central hydrophobic interaction mainly involves a patch of three residues
in Rpt1-C, Leu406, and Leu410 (helix α2) and in Leu444 (helix
α4) contacting ﬁve residues of Hsm3: Val194 (helix α5B), Ile231,
Leu232, Ile235 (helix α6B), and Phe283 (helix α7B) (Fig. 2B). The
hydrophobic core is surrounded by networks of charged and
polar interactions, including three salt bridges between Rpt1-C
and Hsm3, namely, Arg403-Asp230, Glu405-Arg195, and
Arg409-Glu157 (Fig. 2B and Fig. S2B).
In summary, Hsm3 binds Rpt1-C through its central conserved
concave surface. The interface between the two proteins is
composed of a hydrophobic core surrounded by a rim of speciﬁc
charged and polar interactions.
To model the likely arrangement of the Rpt1 module encompassing both the catalytic and Cter domains further, we took advantage of the structural similarity between Rpt1-C and other AAA
ATPases that were solved with both the AAA catalytic and Cter
domains (i.e., PAN, Ftsh). A simple superimposition of the Cter
domains showed that the AAA catalytic domain can accommodate
in the Hsm3 croissant clamp without any major steric clash (Fig.
2C). Therefore, the model of the Hsm3-Rpt1 catalytic domain

is compatible with that observed for the isolated Cter domain,
suggesting that both proteins can bind to each other without undergoing major structural rearrangements.
Effects of Hsm3 and Rpt1 Mutations on Complex Formation. To
corroborate the structural data and further identify binding hot
spots at the interface, truncations and mutations of the Hsm3–
Rpt1-C complex were designed and assessed with a two-hybrid
assay (see below) and in Escherichia coli lysates (Fig. S3). The
crystal structure of the Hsm3–Rpt1-C complex indicated that the
central part of Hsm3 was mainly involved in the molecular interaction with Rpt1-C. Consistently, Hsm3 lacking the ﬁrst 115
amino acids (corresponding to repeats R1–R3; Fig. 1 and Fig.
S1) or the last 104 residues (corresponding to repeats R10–R11;
Fig. 1 and Fig. S1) maintained the interaction with both Rpt1-C
and full-length Rpt1 in the two-hybrid system (Fig. 3A). The
extreme C-terminal tail of Rpt1 was absent from the crystal
structure density, suggesting that, contrary to the Nas2-Rpt5
interaction (26), the C-terminal tail of Rpt1 is not required for
interacting with Hsm3. We conﬁrmed this result using the twohybrid system (Fig. S3A) and in E. coli lysates (Fig. S3B) using
a truncated Rpt1-C domain lacking the last 14 residues.
We next mutated residues located at the central hydrophobic
core of the interface between Hsm3 and Rpt1-C (Fig. 2B).
Mutant Leu232Arg in Hsm3 severely compromised the Hsm3–
Rpt1-C interaction, and the double mutation Leu232Arg
Ile235Arg disrupted the interaction in the two-hybrid assay (Fig.
S4A). Similarly, several hydrophobic positions at the center of
the Rpt1-C domain interface were mutated, namely, Leu406,
Leu410, and Leu444. The impact of the different mutations

of the Rpt1AAA domain has been modeled as described in
Materials and Methods. The position of the Rpt1-C domain
was observed in the crystal structure of the Hsm3–Rpt1-C
complex. (D) Model of Hsm3 in complex with the ATPase
domains of Rpt1 and Rpt2. Hsm3 is represented with an

(main text and Figs. 3A and 6). The Rpt1 ATPase domain is
depicted as in C. The position of Rpt2 (in blue) has been
modeled as described in Materials and Methods. In A–D,
the orientation of Hsm3 is identical to that presented in
Fig. 1 (Upper), and an additional view after 90° of rotation
is added in D.

assessed using the two-hybrid assay (Fig. S4B) is summarized in
Fig. 3B. Western blot analyses assessed that none of the mutations in Hsm3 and Rpt1-C proteins affected their integrity or
expression level (Fig. S4 D and E). The severe loss of interaction
on mutation of the hydrophobic residues buried in the core of
the binding interface shows their key contribution to the stabilization of the Hsm3–Rpt1 complex.
Next, we analyzed the relative importance of the charged environment at the rim of the interface (Fig. 2B). We designed
several mutants of charged residues in the Rpt1-C domain at the
rim of the Hsm3–Rpt1-C complex interface, namely, Arg403Ala,
Arg403Glu, Glu405Ala, Glu405Arg, Arg409Ala, Arg409Glu,
and Glu440Arg, plus Glu399Arg as a negative control (Fig. 3B
and Fig. S4C). Mutations of Arg403 and Arg409 severely impaired the interaction (Fig. 3B and Fig. S4C). Interestingly, the
charge reversal of Asp230Arg in Hsm3 could partially compensate for the defect induced in the Rpt1-C Arg403Glu mutant
(Fig. 3C, last column). This compensatory double mutant
strongly suggests that the salt bridge between Asp230 of Hsm3
and Arg403 of Rpt1 observed in the crystal structure contributes
to the stabilization of the Hsm3–Rpt1 complex.
The contacts we have identiﬁed between Hsm3 and Rpt1 are
likely to be of biological signiﬁcance because the inability of
Rpt1 mutants to promote Hsm3 binding in the two- hybrid assay
correlates with a loss of function in vivo (see Fig. 7A).
In summary, mutation analyses highlighted the central hydrophobic patch as a major contributor to the Hsm3–Rpt1-C
interaction, whereas mutations within the charged and polar
interaction networks at the rim of the interface affected the interaction less drastically.

The crystal structure of the base assembly chaperone gankyrin/
Nas6 in complex with Rpt3-C shows that the binding interface is
mostly polar and charged (27, 28). It is also wider and engages
a larger surface on Rpt3, extending to the complete α1–α2 loop
and the α3–α4 loops, together with almost all repeats of the
chaperone. In contrast, in the Hsm3–Rpt1 complex, only the
central region of the chaperone is sufﬁcient for Rpt1-C binding
(Fig. 2A), leaving a large part of the chaperone surface accessible
to the solvent or to the association with other partners as
shown below.
Hsm3 Binds to the Non-ATPase Rpn1 Subunit. In vivo, Hsm3 is part
of a complex containing Rpn1, Rpt2, and Rpt1, referred to as the
Hsm3 module. We tested for a direct interaction between the
non-ATPase subunit Rpn1 and the Hsm3 chaperone. In a twohybrid assay, we could detect a weak but reproducible interaction
between Rpn1 and Hsm3 in both GAL4 activating domain
(AD)-DNA binding domain orientations (Fig. 4A). Because the
two protein partners are soluble when expressed in E. coli, we
examined their direct interaction. Rpn1 was speciﬁcally bound to
the glutathione resin when GST-Hsm3 was present (Fig. 4B,
compare lane 5 and lane 4). When present, full-length Rpt1 did
not preclude the interaction between Hsm3 and Rpn1 (Fig. 4B,
lane 6), consistent with a direct simultaneous binding of Hsm3 to
both 19S RP subunits. In conclusion, a direct interaction between Hsm3 and Rpn1 likely occurs, further entangling the
network of interaction building the module.

Rpn1 Binds to the N-Terminal Domain of Rpt2. Human or Schizosaccharomyces pombe Rpn1 was previously reported to bind
Rpt2 (29, 30). Using full-length Rpt2 as bait, we isolated Rpn1 as
prey in a genomic-scale, two-hybrid screen (Fig. 5A). Like Rpt1,
Rpt2 protein bacterially expressed alone is almost completely
insoluble in our assay. In contrast, coexpression with Rpn1 or
colysis with E. coli expressing Rpn1 resulted in a signiﬁcant increase in the levels of soluble Rpt2, indicating that the complex
formation with Rpn1 promotes Rpt2 solubility (Fig. 5B, Left).
Moreover, immobilization of His6-Rpn1 on Ni++ resin resulted
in efﬁcient binding of Rpt2, showing that when coexpressed or
solubilized by the presence of Rpn1, Rpt2 directly interacts with
Rpn1 (Fig. 5B, Right). Based on recent crystallographic structural data of PAN ATPase architecture (12, 13), we delimited
ﬁve major domains in Rpt2, namely, the N-terminal (Nter) domain, CC domain, OB-fold (OB) domain, AAA ATPase (AAA)
domain, and Cter domain (Fig. 5C). We tested for the ability of
each domain to promote the interaction with Rpn1 in the twohybrid system. We established that the NH2-terminal 165 residues of Rpt2 (comprising the Nter, CC, and OB domains) is
sufﬁcient for Rpn1 binding (Fig. 5 A and C). Importantly, the
Nter domain of Rpt2 seems to be required for the Rpn1-Rpt2
interaction, because Rpt2ΔNter is deﬁcient for interaction with
Rpn1 (Fig. 5 A and C) but still competent for the interaction with
Rpt6, its neighboring subunit within the ATPase ring (Fig. 5C),
showing that the Rpt2ΔNter construct is functional. In conclusion, we show that Rpt2 is engaged in a tight network involving
its Nter domain to bind Rpn1.

another two-hybrid screen (31), is all the more surprising because they are located in neighboring positions in the ATPase
ring. We next determined if the a priori direct Hsm3-Rpt2 interaction was evolutionary conserved. For this purpose, we used
S5b, the human remote homolog of Hsm3, as bait in our twohybrid assay. We observed that S5b was able to bind full-length
human Rpt2 but not yeast Rpt2 (Fig. 5E).
To ﬁgure out the possible arrangement of Hsm3 with its different partners, we elaborated a structural model based on the
high-resolution structure of the AAA ATPase homohexamer of
a bacterial protease Ftsh (Fig. 2D, Fig. S5A, and Table S2). On
the basis of this model, we anticipated that the C-terminal part of
Hsm3 could be involved in the binding of the AAA domain of
Rpt2. Dissection of the Rpt2–Hsm3 interacting domains was
thus experimentally tackled following the strategy described
above for the Rpt2–Rpn1 pair (Fig. 5C). Combining N-terminal
and C-terminal deletions, we established that only the AAA
domain of Rpt2, but not the Nter, CC, or OB domain, is necessary for Hsm3 binding. This is consistent with what was proposed for the human proteins using a less direct approach based
on chimeric ATPase subunits (30). Unlike Rpt1-C, the Cter
domain of Rpt2 is neither sufﬁcient nor necessary to promote the
interaction with Hsm3 (Fig. 5C). Hence, Hsm3 interacts with
both Rpt subunits but in a different way.
Having uncovered a previously undescribed direct partner for
Hsm3, we tested for the requirement of different parts of Hsm3
for Rpt2 binding. Although deletion of the ﬁrst N-terminal 115
residues of Hsm3 has no effect on Rpt2 binding, deletion of the
last 104 residues of the chaperone severely impairs the interaction with Rpt2 in the two-hybrid system (Fig. 6A). In contrast, Rpt1 could still interact with either the N- or C-terminally
truncated Hsm3 in this assay (Fig. 3A). The C-terminal truncated
form of Hsm3 (hereafter, Hsm3ΔC) binds both Rpt1 (Fig. 6B,
lanes 3 and 5) and Rpn1 (Fig. 6B, lanes 6 and 7) in vitro as efﬁciently as full-length Hsm3. Hence, in agreement with our 3D
model (Fig. 2D), the C-terminal part of Hsm3 is fully dispensable
for Rpt1 binding but is speciﬁcally required for Rpt2 binding.
C-Terminal Part of Hsm3 Is Required in Vivo for Base Assembly. The
ﬁrst identiﬁed physical partner of Hsm3 was the ATPase subunit Rpt1 (19). Here, we show that Hsm3 also binds the base
subunit Rpt2 (Fig. 5 C and D). Moreover, we identiﬁed a Cterminal truncated version of Hsm3, which does not bind Rpt2
but still maintains its interaction with Rpt1 both in vitro and in
a two-hybrid assay (Figs. 3A and 6 A and B). Hence, we have
isolated a separation-of-function Hsm3 mutant, which seems to
be an appropriate tool to investigate the in vivo functional
importance of Rpt2 binding by Hsm3. For this purpose, we
introduced the mutation at the HSM3 locus in various strains
and examined the behavior of this mutant. Deletion of HSM3
moderately affects growth at 30 °C but severely impairs growth
at 37 °C (19) (Fig. 6C). We observed a signiﬁcant growth defect
at 37 °C for the hsm3ΔC mutant (Fig. 6C). RPN4 encodes
a transcriptional regulator of proteasome genes, (32) and
HSM3 deletion caused synthetic lethality with a deletion of
RPN4 (19). The hsm3ΔC rpn4Δ double mutants can germinate,
but the corresponding spores were smaller than the parental
simple mutants (Fig. 6D). Moreover, the double-mutant strain
showed a severe growth defect at 34 °C (Fig. 6E). These
observations indicate a role for the Hsm3 Cter domain in
proteasome functions.
We next examined the consequences of deleting the Hsm3
Cter domain on the proteasome assembly complexes in cell
extracts. We ﬁrst analyzed the composition of Hsm3-containing
complexes in the WT and in hsm3ΔC backgrounds. For this
purpose, we added a Myc-epitope tag to full-length Hsm3 and to
Hsm3ΔC in the chromosomal context. Both proteins were expressed and detected at comparable levels by Western blot
analysis at 30 °C and 37 °C (Fig. 6F). Hsm3 Myc-tagged protein
was then immunoprecipitated, and we examined the base subunits that were coimmunoprecipitated. As previously reported,

Discussion
Among known base chaperones, Hsm3 is unique because it binds
no less than three proteasome subunits, two Rpt and one Rpn
subunits, and its deletion leads to signiﬁcant growth defects (19,
20). Here, we report Rpn1 and Rpt2 as two direct binding
partners for Hsm3 (Fig. 7B) and provide structural and functional insights into Hsm3–Rpt1 and Hsm3–Rpt2 complexes. Our
study revealed that within the Rpt1–Rpt2–Rpn1 complex, Hsm3
displays direct interactions with every partner of this module.
These results prompted us to extend the role of Hsm3 in proteasome assembly, which, unexpectedly, directly facilitates assembly of neighboring ATPases (Fig. 7C).
Our study does not exclude the possibility that other proteins
may participate in Hsm3 assembly modules. For instance, it has
been reported that Ubp6 could be associated with a fraction of the
Rpn1–Rpt2 module (20, 33), probably via its interaction with
Rpn1 (34).

Rpn1, and Rpt2. However, native PAGE, followed by Western
blot analysis, showed that Hsm3 is also part of at least two other
distinct higher molecular-weight complexes, which correspond to
base-like and 19S RP-like complexes (Fig. 8A). Hence, a fraction
of Hsm3 could be associated with whole RP. Consistently, Hsm3
can be immunoprecipitated using a lid subunit as bait (Fig. S7).
According to the structural model of the Hsm3–Rpt1–Rpt2
complex, the whole hexamer can be accommodated without any
major clash (Fig. 8C). In contrast, Hsm3 was never found associated with a larger 19S RP-20S CP (19). On overexpression of
Hsm3, the association of Hsm3 with base and 19S RP subcomplexes was reinforced (Fig. 8 A and B and Fig. S7). This was
accompanied by a signiﬁcant decrease in the association of the
base and lid with 20S CP (Fig. 8B and Fig. S7). Interestingly, the
structural model of Hsm3 bound to the hexamer of Rpts reveals
that the competition is likely direct, because the position of
Hsm3 would induce massive steric hindrance with 20S CP
(Fig. 8C).

Hsm3 was truncated at the carboxyl terminus (Fig. 6F). The
decrease was also observed, but far more modestly, for Rpt1
(Fig. 6F), most probably reﬂecting the intrinsic ability of
Hsm3ΔC Myc to still interact with Rpt1. To examine the precise
step of base assembly that is impaired in vivo in an hsm3ΔC
context, cell extracts were fractionated by native PAGE, followed by Western blotting with antibodies raised against Rpt1,
Rpt2, Rpn1, and Hsm3 (Fig. 6G). The experimental conditions
used allowed us to identify several light complexes containing
Hsm3 in the WT strain. The use of both untagged and Myctagged versions of Hsm3 led to an unambiguous identiﬁcation of
a complex containing Hsm3, Rpn1, Rpt1, and Rpt2, because the
presence of the 13-Myc epitope in Hsm3 modiﬁed the migration
of every member of the complex (Fig. 6G). Remarkably, in the
absence of the Cter domain of Hsm3, the pattern of Rpn1-,
Rpt1-, and Rpt2-containing species is altered and reminiscent of
what is observed in the absence of Hsm3 (Fig. S6). In particular,
a complex comigrating with Hsm3, Rpn1, Rpt1, and Rpt2 is
nearly absent (Fig. 6G and Fig. S6), showing that Rpt1 binding
by Hsm3 is not sufﬁcient for promoting the formation of the
Rpt1–Rpt2–Rpn1–Hsm3 assembly intermediate. Because we
have clearly established that Hsm3ΔC retained the capacity to
bind Rpt1 but lost its capacity to bind Rpt2, these observations
strongly suggest that Rpt2 binding to Hsm3 is required for formation of the assembly of the Rpn1–Rpt2–Rpt1–Hsm3 complex
in vivo. Thus, we displayed a previously undescribed function for
Hsm3, which, through Rpt2 binding, acts as a matchmaker between Rpt1 and the Rpn1–Rpt2 complex during proteasome
assembly (Fig. 7).
In such a scenario, recapitulating the loss of Hsm3 requires the
impairment of both Hsm3-Rpt1 and Hsm3-Rpt2 interactions. As
shown in Fig. 6, deletion of the C-terminal part of Hsm3 precludes Rpt2 binding. Mutations in Rpt1 that impair Hsm3
binding in the hsm3ΔC context should thus phenocopy the deletion of Hsm3. We introduced Rpt1 E399R, R403E, R409E,
L406E, or L410R into an hsm3ΔC strain and compared the
growth of the corresponding strains with the growth of the
hsm3Δ strain at 36 °C. Remarkably, mutations R403E, R409E,
L406E, and L410R in Rpt1, which were shown to impair the
interaction with Hsm3 in our two-hybrid assay (Fig. 3 and Fig.
S4), led to no growth at 36 °C (Fig. 7A, lanes 5, 7, 9, and 12), thus
mimicking the deletion of HSM3 (Fig. 7A, lane 13). We did not
observe such defects when introducing the E399R mutation (Fig.

binding to 20S CP. (A) Protein extracts from WT cells or cells overexpressing
WT full-length Hsm3 (2μ HSM3+) or not (2μ HSM3−) were resolved by native

and a 19S RP-like complex (III). When overexpressed, Hsm3 also accumulates
in its free form as indicated. (B) Overexpression of Hsm3 impairs the association between 20S CP and 19S RP. Rpn1-TAP or Rpn9-TAP strain was

(Right) Position of the 20S CP is shown in gray.

Hsm3 Plays a Dual Role in Proteasome Assembly. Previous studies
suggested that Hsm3, initially in charge of free Rpt1, would then
deliver Rpt1 to the Rpn1–Rpt2 complex to release a tight Rpn1–
Rpt1–Rpt2 module resembling that found in the entire 19S RP.
Surprisingly, Rpt1-Rpt2 interaction was not strong enough to be
detected in the systems we used, even if they are located in neighboring positions within the ATPase ring (11). Others also failed
to detect it (31); in contrast to what is observed for Rpt3-Rpt6 or
Rpt4-Rpt5, Rpt1 and Rpt2 do not seem to form an extended CC
in the EM images (7). In contrast, we observed a strong interaction between Rpt2 and Rpt6 involving the OB domain of
Rpt2, showing that we were able to detect interactions with the
other Rpt2 neighboring subunit. We also showed that the N-terminal part of Rpt2 is bound to Rpn1. We detected a very weak
interaction between Rpn1 and Rpt1 by the two-hybrid assay, but
Rpn1 was not able to solubilize Rpt1 in vitro. Therefore, neither
interaction between Rpt1 and Rpt2 nor between Rpt1 and Rpn1
might be strong enough to engage Rpt1 in the [Rpn1–Rpt2]
module stably in an early assembly intermediate.
To date, none of the 19S RP chaperones has been shown to
bind two Rpt proteins; therefore, it was considered unlikely that
the chaperones perform a scaffolding function in assembly. In
contrast to current presumption in the ﬁeld, our results indicate
that Hsm3 plays a major role not only for supporting Rpt1 but
for maintaining the fragile Rpt1–[Rpt2–Rpn1] connection. The
carboxyl-terminal part of Hsm3 is absolutely required for its interaction with Rpt2 but is fully dispensable for the interaction
E1008 | www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1116538109

with Rpt1. We showed that the Hsm3 Cter domain supports an
efﬁcient base assembly in vivo, and thus normal cell growth. In
summary, our results show that Hsm3 binding to Rpt1, although
required, is not sufﬁcient to fulﬁll the incorporation of Rpt1 into
the Rpn1–Rpt2 complex. This observation underlines the importance of Rpt2 binding by Hsm3 to assist base assembly.
Consistently abrogating both Hsm3-Rpt1 and Hsm3-Rpt2 binding phenocopies the absence of Hsm3. The clipping role of Hsm3
in the Rpt1–[Rpt2–Rpn1] early assembly intermediate is likely to
be important at least until the Rpt1–Rpt2 association is stabilized
later in assembly process by joining other modules containing
Rpt5 and/or Rpt6.
In contrast to what was observed for the interaction between
Hsm3 and Rpt1, the Rpt2-C is not sufﬁcient to bind Hsm3. Indeed, Hsm3 binding to Rpt2 involves the AAA domain of the
Rpt subunit even if the Rpt2-C could contribute to the stabilization of the complex. Thus, the Hsm3 interaction with Rpt2
represents the unique interaction of a base chaperone with an
Rpt subunit that does not target the Rpt-C. To date, as for Rpt2C, no speciﬁc chaperone targeting the Rpt4-C was identiﬁed.
Interestingly, Nas2 chaperone targets the Rpt5-C but is part of
the Rpt4–Rpt5 complex. An attractive hypothesis is that Nas2
binds Rpt4 as Hsm3 binds Rpt2. However, in contrast to Nas6,
Rpn14, or Hsm3, Nas2 binding to Rpt5 requires the last three
amino acids of the Rpt tail (26). Hence, the 19S RP chaperones
are not only different in sequence and structure but could support different functions in the assembly process.
Binding to Hsm3 Constrains the Mobility Between Rpt1 and Rpt2.

Different parts of the proteasome assembly puzzle could be
further unraveled through the structural analysis of the Hsm3–
Rpt1-C complex. First, we focused on the Rpt1–Rpt2 couple and
probe how Hsm3 could be accommodated with respect to the
known arrangement of neighboring subunits in AAA+ ATPase
hexamers. Drastic orientation differences between two neighboring AAA+ subunits were revealed in the structures of hexameric AAA+ ATPases, such as FtsH (35, 36). Among all the
structures of hexameric AAA+ ATPase solved to date, the
structure of Rpt1-C best matches that of the C-terminal end of
FtsH (rmsd = 1.0 Å, 35% identity), for which no less than ﬁve
different orientations among neighboring subunits could be observed (Fig. S5B and Table S2). Interestingly, only one of the ﬁve
orientations observed in FtsH is compatible with the orientation
imposed by the Hsm3–Rpt1-C binding mode, with the others
leading to signiﬁcant clashes (Fig. S5B and Table S2). The
resulting model for the Hsm3–Rpt1–Rpt2 complex highlights the
importance of the Hsm3 C-terminal repeats for the interaction
with the AAA+ domain of Rpt2 (Fig. 2D and Fig. S5A), in full
agreement with our functional data obtained with the Hsm3ΔC.
Large intersubunit motions possibly coupled to intrasubunit
conformational changes were proposed to act as major driving
forces in the ATP-fueled translocation of polypeptides (35, 37),
with an asymmetry for ATP/ADP binding of Rpt pairs (38).
Therefore, the association of the Rpt1–Rpt2 pair with the Hsm3
chaperone could restrict the mobility of the Rpt1–Rpt2 pair in
the preassembly complexes, and could thus freeze activation
processes requiring conformational changes.
Hsm3 Could Cap the ATPase Ring Until Docking to the 20S CP. In vivo,
Hsm3 appears to be a hub of the elementary building block
gathering Rpt1, Rpn1, and Rpt2; it was also shown to persist in
larger assemblies after the ATPase six-membered ring is formed
but is excluded from 20S CP-associated complexes. In addition,
overexpression of Hsm3 precluded the association of 19S RP
with 20S CP, supporting the view that both systems compete for
binding the 19S RP. The structural model of Hsm3 bound to the
hexamer of Rpts suggests that the competition is direct (Fig. 8C).
Hsm3 might thus contribute to inhibit the premature assembly of
the base with the 20S CP. It has been shown that ATP is required
for the proper association between the 19S RP and 20S CP.
Incidentally, ATP hydrolysis is associated with the molecular

Materials and Methods
Protein Expression and Puriﬁcation for Crystallization Experiments. The ﬁrst
steps for the production and puriﬁcation of recombinant proteins for
structural studies was the same for Hsm3 free and bound to the Rpt1 Cter
domain. Production of Hsm3 labeled with selenomethionine was performed
using the same protocol, except that the cellular culture was performed in
minimal medium supplemented with selenomethionine. Recombinant soluble (His)6-tagged GST fusion proteins were immobilized on glutathione
disulﬁde (GSH) agarose (Sigma) and then eluted with an excess of glutathione (Sigma). They were cleaved using a (His)6-tagged TEV protease (1%
wt/wt of protease/fusion protein). A nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA)
agarose column (Qiagen) or a Histrap (GE Healthcare) was used to trap the
(His)6-tagged TEV protease and the (His)6-tagged GST, as described by
Mousson et al. (41).
Crystallization and Data Collection. For Hsm3 alone, puriﬁed protein was
concentrated to 7 mg/mL with a 10-kDa cutoff concentrator (Millipore) and
buffer-exchanged to 50 mM Tris (pH 7.4). Crystals of Hsm3 were grown by
sitting drop vapor diffusion at 20 °C against a reservoir solution containing
20% (wt/vol) PEG 4000, 0.2 M malate imidazole (pH 5.5). Plate-shaped
crystals were grown for a few days and reached a size of 240 × 240 × 20 μm3.
Crystals were ﬂash-frozen in liquid nitrogen after cryoprotection with glycerol-supplemented reservoir solution.
For the Hsm3–Rpt1-C complex, puriﬁed Hsm3–Rpt1-C fusion protein
(details on construction are provided in SI Materials and Methods) was
concentrated up to 10 mg/mL with a 10-kDa cutoff concentrator and exchanged into the buffer [50 mM Tris (pH 7.4), NaCl 150 mM]. PreScission
protease (2,000 U/mL; GE Healthcare) was added (1 μL for 200 μg of protein)
and incubated at 4 °C overnight. Complete digestion was checked by SDS/
PAGE. Crystals of the complex were grown by sitting drop vapor diffusion at
20 °C against reservoir solution containing 5 M sodium formate, 0.1 M Hepes
(pH 7.5). Crystals were ﬂash-frozen in liquid nitrogen directly from their
sitting drop.
Diffraction data were collected on the Proxima1 beamline at the Synchrotron SOLEIL at the following wave lengths: 0.992 Å for HSM3 and 0.980 Å
for the Hsm3–Rpt1-C complex at 77 °K. Hsm3 crystals belong to space group
P212121 and diffracted up to a resolution of 2.1 Å (Table S1). Hsm3-SeMet
crystals belong to the space group C2221 and diffracted up to a resolution of
2.3 Å. Using selenomethionine-incorporated crystal, we collected a SAD
dataset at a wavelength of 0.979 Å, corresponding to the peak of the selenium K absorption edge. The corresponding anomalous signal of this
dataset was 1.251, and the ﬁgure of merit after SAD phasing was 0.485.
Crystals of the Hsm3–Rpt1-C complex belong to the space group P6522 and
diffracted up to 3.8 Å. All data were processed and integrated using XDS
(42) (Table S1).
Structure Determination and Reﬁnement. Structure resolution of Hsm3 was
carried out using the SAD dataset. Selenium atoms were located using
SHELXC/D programs, and the phases were reﬁned with the Phaser program

and improved by density modiﬁcation using the Dm program (http://www.
ccp4.ac.uk/). The ﬁrst steps of the Hsm3 model building were performed
automatically using Buccaneer (43) and completed manually with Coot
(44), using the iterative ARP/wARP approach (45). The structure was reﬁned using Refmac5 (46). The ﬁnal steps of reﬁnement were done with
BUSTER software (47) (Table S1). Ramachandran statistics obtained are as
follows: 97.97% of Ψ-Φ angles were found in the postfavored regions,
1.92% were found in additional allowed regions, and 0.11% were found in
disallowed regions.
The structure of the Hsm3–Rpt1–Cter complex was solved by molecular
replacement with MOLREP (48) using our coordinates of free Hsm3 as the
search model and a model of the structure of Rpt1 Cter available in the
ModBase database (49) obtained by homology with the AAA ATPase Ftsh
(PDB ID code 2CE7). Two complexes per asymmetrical unit were found with
a contrast of 2.25 and 1.94, respectively, for the ﬁrst and second molecules
(Table S1). The structure was reﬁned with Buster software with noncrystallographic symmetry constraints for the two complexes. Translation
libration screw-motion (TLS) parameters, introduced using ﬁve groups in the
Hsm3 molecule, improved the electron density for the building of an additional fragment in both proteins. An additional density corresponding to the
linker was observed and could be modeled by a polyalanine, but the resolution was not high enough to assign side chains. This additional linker is
dispensable for the formation of the complex. Because of the moderate
resolution of the data, manual modiﬁcations were limited to the strict
minimum to prevent any model bias. The ﬁnal model and phases qualities
were checked calculating two omit maps for Rpt1, which validated the position and interface Rpt1-C (Fig. S2). Structure representations presented in
Figs. 1, 2, 3, and 8 and Figs. S2 and S5 were drawn with pymol (Schrodinger).
Coordinates are available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB ID codes 4A3T and
4A3V for free and Rpt1-C bound Hsm3, respectively).
Modeling of the Rpt1–Rpt2–Hsm3 Complex. Details are provided in SI Materials
and Methods.
Yeast Techniques. Standard yeast genetic techniques and media were used
(50). Yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table S3. To determine
growth in various conditions, yeast strains were grown to OD600 = 0.1–0.5
before being plated at 10-fold serial dilutions on YPD medium with or
without drugs. 3-Aminotriazol (3AT) was purchased from Sigma.
DNA Manipulation. The methods for DNA engineering were essentially those
described by Sambrook et al. (51). Plasmids used in this study are listed in
Table S4. Sequences and details of constructions are available on request.
Two-Hybrid Experiments. The bait was cloned into pGBT9 or pGBKT7 vector
and introduced into the Y187 strain. The prey was cloned in pACT2 vector.
Mating was performed as described by Fromont-Racine et al. (52). Because we
used the Y190 strain, which has a leaky HIS3 reporter gene, the growth of
diploids was examined in the presence of 3AT at various concentrations (1.5–
25 mM ﬁnal). Diploids were grown on nonselective liquid medium, the OD at
600 nm was adjusted to 0.1, and serial dilutions were spotted onto selective
plates with or without 3AT and then incubated for 1 or 2 d at 30 °C.
Puriﬁcation of Recombinant Proteins for in Vitro Binding Assays. His-Rpn1,
Rpn1, Rpt2, His-GST-Hsm3, His-GST-Hsm3ΔC, and/or Rpt1[377–467]-maltose
binding protein was (co)expressed in E. coli using a derivative of pRSF–Duet1 vector (Novagen). Sequences and details on constructions are available on
demand. Whole-cell extracts from transformed BL21 (DE3) cells were prepared as previously described (19, 53). Ni-NTA magnetic agarose beads
(Qiagen) were added to protein extracts in buffer C [50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 300
mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween-20] in the presence of 10 mM imidazole. Beads were
washed with buffer C plus 20 mM imidazole. Bound proteins were eluted in
the same buffer adjusted to 250 mM imidazole.
For GST fusion protein puriﬁcation, 50 μL of glutathione agarose (G4510;
Sigma) was added to soluble extracts prepared in 50 mM Tris·HCl (pH 8),
200 mM NaCl, and 0.05% Tween-20. After incubation overnight at 4 °C on
agitation, the resin was washed four times and bound proteins were eluted
by adding 80 μL of 50 mM Tris·HCl (pH 9) and 10 mM L-glutathione reduced
(G4251; Sigma) for 30 min at 30 °C. Relevant fractions were analyzed by SDS/
PAGE, and proteins were stained using Simply Blue Safe Stain (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Immunoprecipitation Experiments. Cleared extracts were prepared from
Myc-tagged or TAP-tagged strains grown at the indicated temperatures,

motions of the Rpt ATPases inside the hexameric ring. From
these observations, it appears that several mechanisms might
account for the association and release of Hsm3, as well as for its
possible role in controlling key proteasome assembly steps.
Hsm3 dissociation might result either from ATP binding and
hydrolysis favoring a conformation of the Rpt1–Rpt2 complex
incompatible with Hsm3 binding or from a direct competition
with the 20S CP during base anchoring. The very last residues of
the Rpt ATPase subunits form what is called the C-tail. The Ctails of Rpt subunits have been shown to bind 20S CP by
inserting themselves into intersubunit pockets formed by the
α-subunits of the 20S CP and to promote 20S CP gating or 26S
proteasome assembly (14, 15, 39, 40). The C-tail is dispensable
for both Hsm3–Rpt1 and Hsm3–Rpt2 interactions (see above);
however, accessibility of these tails within the assembly complexes is an open question and could be modulated on ATP
hydrolysis and/or association of the base with the lid. Further
investigation will help to answer these key issues for proteasome
biogenesis.
In summary, Hsm3 acts as a scaffolding protein, which could
explain its key role in proteasome assembly, underscoring the
complexity and ﬁne-tuning of the highly orchestrated base
assembly pathways.

and immunoprecipitation experiments were performed as previously described (19, 53).
