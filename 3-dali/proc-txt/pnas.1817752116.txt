Proteasomes occur in all three domains of life, and are the principal
molecular machines for the regulated degradation of intracellular proteins. They play key roles in the maintenance of protein
homeostasis, and control vital cellular processes. While the eukaryotic 26S proteasome is extensively characterized, its putative
evolutionary precursor, the archaeal proteasome, remains poorly
understood. The primordial archaeal proteasome consists of a 20S
proteolytic core particle (CP), and an AAA-ATPase module. This
minimal complex degrades protein unassisted by non-ATPase
subunits that are present in a 26S proteasome regulatory particle
(RP). Using cryo-EM single-particle analysis, we determined structures of the archaeal CP in complex with the AAA-ATPase PAN
(proteasome-activating nucleotidase). Five conformational states
were identified, elucidating the functional cycle of PAN, and its
interaction with the CP. Coexisting nucleotide states, and correlated
intersubunit signaling features, coordinate rotation of the PANATPase staircase, and allosterically regulate N-domain motions and
CP gate opening. These findings reveal the structural basis for a
sequential around-the-ring ATPase cycle, which is likely conserved
in AAA-ATPases.
PAN

among which the proteasome activating-nucleotidase (PAN) was
the first discovered with CP-activating properties (20). PAN is a
chaperone present in many archaeal species (21), and exhibits
∼41–45% sequence homology to the Rpts (regulatory particle
AAA-ATPases) of the 26S proteasome (20). Although the structure
of full-length PAN is hitherto unsolved, crystal structures of domains of Methanocaldococcus janaschii and Archaeoglobus fulgidus
PAN show that six PAN protomers associate to form three twostranded coiled coils, a hexameric oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide
binding (OB) ring, and a hexameric AAA ring (22, 23). At the
C-terminal end of each PAN protomer is an HbYX motif (where
Hb is a hydrophobic residue, Y is tyrosine, and X is any amino acid),
which is supposedly involved in CP activation (24). However, the
physical association and mode of interaction between PAN and CP
lack detailed structural characterization. An in-depth analysis of the
PAN-proteasome structure is therefore essential to understand archaeal protein degradation in further detail.

Proteasomes are ATP-dependent proteases that occur in all
three domains of life, and are the principal molecular machines
for the regulated degradation of intracellular proteins. The
eukaryotic 26S proteasome has been extensively characterized.
However, its evolutionary precursor, the archaeal proteasome–
ATPase complex, remains poorly understood. The inherent instability of these primordial protein complexes has so far hindered attempts for detailed structure determination. Using
cryo-EM single-particle analysis, we were able to determine the
structure of an archaeal PAN-proteasome, which is a complex of
the proteolytic core and the ATPase PAN (proteasome-activating
nucleotidase). The structures reported here not only provide insights into the functional cycle of PAN-proteasomes, they reveal a
fundamental mechanism of ATPase operation.

P

roteasomes are ATP-dependent self-compartmentalizing
proteases that occur in all three domains of life, and are
responsible for selective protein degradation in crowded cellular
environments (1, 2). By degrading proteins that are misfolded,
mistranslated, damaged, or no longer needed by the cell, proteasomes play a pivotal role in cellular protein homeostasis,
stress response, protein quality control, cell cycle control, regulation of metabolism, and other essential processes (3, 4). Recent
extensive studies have elucidated in detail the structure of yeast
and mammalian 26S proteasomes, and provided conformational
insights into their functional cycle (5–11). However, in case of
archaeal proteasomes, neither the architecture nor the mechanistic principles are clearly understood.
Archaeal proteasomes are minimal complexes, composed of a
20S proteolytic core (CP), and an ATPase module (12). They lack
an elaborate regulatory complex (RP), as is present in 26S proteasomes, and the ATPase alone drives protein degradation. These
proteasomes possess the compositional simplicity of prokaryotic
ATP-dependent proteases [such as ClpXP, ClpAP, HslUV, etc.
(13)], along with key architectural features of the 26S proteasome,
and can thus be regarded as evolutionary precursors of the 26S
proteasome (14). However, detailed structural characterizations of
archaeal proteasomes (CP-ATPase complexes) have not been
published so far, in part because of difficulties in sample preparation that suggested a dynamic nature of these complexes.
The archaeal CP is an ∼700-kDa barrel-shaped protein complex composed of four stacked homoheptameric rings (15). The
outer rings comprise α-subunits, whose N-terminal extensions
form a gate that blocks protein diffusion into the proteolytic
chamber (16). The inner rings comprise β-subunits that harbor
the proteolytic sites (17). In the absence of a dedicated RP, the
CP collaborates with a network of AAA-ATPases (18, 19),

Here we report the cryo-EM structure of A. fulgidus PANproteasome (PAN-CP complex) in the presence of adenosine 5ʹ-O(3-thiotriphosphate) (ATPγS). With the PAN-AAA ring resolved at
∼4.9 Å, and the CP resolved at ∼4.1 Å, it was possible to unambiguously model the PAN-proteasome structure to near-atomic resolution. We identified five distinct conformational states, which show
sequential rotation of the hexameric PAN ATPase ring, alongside
movements of the PAN N domain and CP gate. These structures not
only provide invaluable insights into the functional cycle of the PANproteasome, they also elucidate a sequential around-the-ring ATPase
cycle that is likely conserved in AAA-ATPases.

PAN and CP from A. fulgidus were separately expressed in Escherichia
coli, and PAN-proteasomes were reconstituted in vitro (Materials
and Methods and SI Appendix, Fig. S1 A and B). Assembly reactions
tested by negative stain EM showed complex formation in presence
of ATP and its slowly hydrolysable analog, ATPγS (SI Appendix, Fig.
S1C). However, in the presence of ATPγS, intact complexes were
more frequently observed. In the presence of ADP or ADP-AlFx
(ATP hydrolysis transition-state analog), PAN-CP complexes were
not observed, indicating that ATP is essential for complex formation, and once hydrolyzed, the complex falls apart. This reflects a
transient nature of PAN-CP interaction, and agrees with previous
biochemical studies (25). However, it is unlike the 26S proteasome,
which remains intact even in the presence of ADP or ADP-AlFx (7,
8). It is difficult to assess the stability of PAN-proteasomes since they
occur in extremophilic organisms, and such conditions cannot be
faithfully reproduced in vitro. Nevertheless, the absence of a dedicated
RP, with clamping subunits, does predispose PAN-proteasomes to
dissociation (26).
Cryo-EM Structure of the PAN-Proteasome. PAN-proteasomes assembled in the presence of ATPγS, were vitrified and imaged using
an FEI Titan Krios transmission electron microscope (TEM),
equipped with a Gatan K2 direct electron detector. The micrographs showed predominantly double-capped particles, where two
PAN hexamers assembled on either side of a CP (SI Appendix, Fig.
S1D), resembling the negative stain MjPAN-TaCP complexes
reported earlier (25). Two-dimensional analyses showed side views
of mainly two types: (i) a “straight view,” with two PAN hexamers
arranged collinear with a sevenfold symmetric CP; and (ii) a “bent
view,” where both PAN hexamers appeared slightly inclined toward
the CP (SI Appendix, Fig. S1E). Each PAN protomer interacts with
the CP via its C-terminal domain and the N-terminal domain is
free. Elements of secondary and tertiary structure were clearly resolved in the CP but less well resolved in PAN, and the PAN coiled
coils appeared smeared. We initially reconstructed a 3D density

Fig. 2. The PAN-proteasome exists in five rotated
spiral-staircase conformations. (A) In the row above,
density maps of AAAob from the five conformational states are displayed. For a fixed position of the
PAN offset on the CP, the states differ in conformation of their AAA ring, and inclination of the N
domain (OB ring and coiled coils). PAN is colored
according to protomer, and in each state, the protomer occupying the highest position is indicated by
asterisks. AAAob densities are placed in the context
of the respective CP (in gray) to emphasize the fixed
position of the offset. In the row below, slices
through the indicated plane position are displayed.
The existence of a split site is clearly visible in the
slices and is further highlighted by white arrowheads. (B) Models of different states of the PANproteasome are superimposed on the respective
PSC densities. In the models, PAN is colored according to protomer, and the CP is in gray. (C) Plot of
pore loop height and nucleotide pocket depth for

and Methods). Height of the tip of pore helices (α5
helix from each PAN protomer) above the plane of the
CP is plotted for every PAN protomer, and is colored
coherently. The size of a nucleotide pocket is plotted as
an overlay. In all of the states, there is a distinct open
pocket (colored white) between the highest and lowest pore helices, while the other pockets (closed) are of
similar size, and colored gray.

map of the double-capped PAN-proteasomes applying C2 symmetry (Fig. 1A). Although the global resolution of our map was
4.47 Å, PAN was at a significantly lower resolution compared with
the CP, and the resolution markedly decreased between the CP,
PAN AAA ring, OB ring, and coiled coils (SI Appendix, Fig. S2A).
To allow for deviations from C2 symmetry, the double-capped
particles were density subtracted in silico into two pseudosinglecapped (PSC) particles and treated independently. An initial 3D
reconstruction of the PSCs resolved at 4.43 Å, and connections
between PAN and CP became visible (Fig. 1B and SI Appendix,
Fig. S2A). Compared with the CP, PAN is positioned at an offset
and the axial channels of PAN and CP are not aligned (Fig. 1 B
and C). Such an arrangement arises from the symmetry mismatch between CP and PAN, and has been noted previously for
other symmetry-mismatched complexes (27, 28).
Interestingly, our PSC reconstruction differs considerably from
the MjPAN-MjCP complexes reported earlier, where PAN appears completely different in structure and is positioned centrally
on the CP axis (29).
Conformational Variability of PAN-Proteasomes. Although the use of
PSCs significantly improved particle alignment, the resolution of
PAN was significantly lower than the CP (SI Appendix, Fig. S2A).
To resolve the structural heterogeneity of PAN, the PAN AAA
ring along with the OB domain (together referred to as AAAob)
was density subtracted from PSCs, aligned against a single reference, and classified further (SI Appendix, Fig. S3). Within the ensemble of AAAob, we observed the existence of five distinct
conformational states (Fig. 2A and SI Appendix, Fig. S3). Each
state was further cleaned in silico (SI Appendix, SI Materials and
Methods and Fig. S4) to generate PSCs of the corresponding states
(SI Appendix, Fig. S5A). The five states differed mainly in: (i)
conformation of the AAA ring and (ii) disposition of the OB ring
(SI Appendix, Table S1 and Movie S1). In each state, the pore
helices of the PAN AAA ring adopted a spiral staircase conformation, with a “split site” formed between the subunit at the lowest
position and the one in the highest (Fig. 2A). Linkers between the
ATPase domain and OB domain were visible for most of the
subunits and the OB ring appeared to perch on them. Keeping the
offset position of PAN fixed with respect to the CP, the AAA
staircase was rotated one subunit per state, giving rise to five distinct split-site positions. The states were unequally populated and
AAAob densities refined to varying resolutions (SI Appendix, Fig.
S5B). However, in all of the states, helices were clearly visible,
thereby allowing us to build pseudoatomic models (Fig. 2B).
In a PAN AAA staircase, the N-terminal tips of the α5 (pore-1)
helices, and in turn the pore-1 loops, exhibit a uniform elevation
above the plane of the CP (Fig. 2C and SI Appendix, SI Materials
and Methods and Table S2). However, the distance between two
adjacent tips remains constant at ∼10 Å, except at the split site.
Similarly, there are five nucleotide pockets of similar size, while
the one between the highest and lowest PAN protomers (at the
split site) is significantly wider (Fig. 2C and SI Appendix, Table
S2). Spiral-staircase conformations are typical of hexameric ringshaped ATPases and have been reported earlier for p97 (30),
Hsp104 (31), Vps4 (32), YME1 (33), Rpts (6), etc. It is hypothesized that the ATPase cycle progresses via rotation of the spiral
staircase (33). Here, five rotated spiral-staircase conformations
have been identified in a hexameric ATPase, revealing a nearly
complete ATPase cycle.
Interestingly, the plane of the OB ring adjusts with the conformation of the AAA ring, and slants from the highest pore helix.
Thus, with rotation of the AAA staircase, the OB plane shows a
wobbling motion, with the coiled coils biased toward the same
direction (SI Appendix, Table S1 and Movie S1). The relatively
low resolution of the coiled coils reflects their high flexibility,
which in conjunction with their unusual surface charge distribution probably facilitates substrate capture.

In all of the five states of the PAN-proteasome, an interesting
feature is the discontinuity of PAN and CP axial channels (SI
Appendix, Table S1), which arises due to the ∼10-Å offset between PAN and CP. Considering these structures to be snapshots
in the proteasomal catalytic cycle, we presume there exist additional conformational states [as in the 26S proteasome (11)],
where the axial channels align and ease substrate passage.
Structure of the PAN AAA Ring Reveals Intersubunit Signaling Features.

Although the AAAob densities from the five states were conformationally distinct, the geometry of their AAA rings was
surprisingly similar, and could be superimposed after appropriate
rotation. For each state, we therefore density subtracted PSCs
to their respective AAA rings, and refined them (SI Appendix,

HbYX-Mediated Interactions Between PAN and CP. The C-terminal
HbYX motif of PAN comprises residues M396-F397-V398 and is
responsible for interaction with the CP. In our PSC reconstructions, HbYX insertions were visible and invariant for all PAN
protomers in all five states, with one HbYX tail weaker than the
others. To analyze HbYX contacts in detail, PSCs for the five
states were density subtracted to 20Sαβ and refined with C1
symmetry (SI Appendix, Fig. S5D). In each density map, six of the
seven inter-α subunit pockets were occupied by HbYX insertions.
Since 20Sαβ densities from the five states showed similar HbYX
occupancies, we have merged them to improve resolution. The
merged 20Sαβ reconstruction resolved at 4.1 Å, and bulky side
chains were visible in most parts of the density (Fig. 4A and SI
Appendix, Fig. S2C). Side-chain information of the merged 20Sαβ
was therefore utilized to refine the atomic models of the PANbound CP (SI Appendix, SI Materials and Methods and Fig. S6A).

measurements (SI Appendix, Table S2) indicate the occurrence of
pockets of only two size ranges.
Three types of nucleotide pockets (open, closed, and intermediate) are possibly associated with three coexisting nucleotide states, as
is found in the mitochondrial ATPase YME1 (33). Interestingly,
PAN and YME1 share another common feature: the incorporation
of ISS motif into the pore-2 helix above the open pocket. In analogy
with YME1, we therefore modeled ATP in the closed pockets, ADP
in the intermediate pocket, and left the open pocket nucleotide-free.
However, we believe the intermediate pocket in our AAA-ring density contains a mixture of ATP(γS) and ADP.
Pore-loop contacts in AAA-rings have not been reported earlier. In case of PAN, an ∼10-Å separation between adjacent α5
helix tips possibly juxtaposes the pore loops to mutually interact.
We suppose these contacts restrict flexibility of the pore loops and
position the pore-loop tyrosine (Y215) in proper register to interact with substrate. Both the ISS contacts and pore-loop contacts are nonexistent at the split site, and with rotation of the spiral
staircase, these contacts are created and destroyed.

Fig. S5C).The refined densities were subsequently locked in silico
in the proper rotational register, and merged. Refinement of our
ensemble of AAA rings resolved at 4.85 Å (Fig. 3A and SI Appendix, Fig. S2B), and bulky side chains could be seen in the bestresolved parts. The 4.85-Å density map was used to refine the
AAA-ring model to near-atomic precision.
Close inspection of the AAA-ring density map enabled us to
identify two major intersubunit contacts, which are also consistently
present in all of the individual states: (i) the pore-1 loops of adjacent subunits are connected via hydrogen bonds between the
backbone oxygen of I216 and backbone nitrogen of K214. These
“pore-loop contacts” appear as an inner railing of the AAA staircase (Fig. 3B); (ii) a phenylalanine residue (F275) at the C-terminal
end of the pore-2 helix (α6) of one subunit contacts an arginine
residue (R205) in the β8 strand of the anticlockwise adjacent subunit, forming a bridge above the nucleotide binding pocket (Fig.
3C). Incidentally, F275 forms a part of a loop comprising D273G274-F275, which is strictly conserved in many AAA-ATPases including the Rpts of the 26S proteasome (9, 33). It is believed that
this loop is critically involved in intersubunit signaling (ISS) and
communicates the nucleotide state between protomers (34).
Interestingly, the bridges formed by F275-D276-P277 (referred
to here as “ISS bridges”) showed three distinct geometries in the
PAN AAA ring: (i) there are four strong ISS bridges that occur
above closed nucleotide pockets. In those pockets, the interaction
of the arginine finger (R302) with the L269 (in the α6 helix) brings
the α6 helix in close proximity to the bound nucleotide (Fig. 3C);
(ii) there is one ISS bridge, partially withdrawn from the anticlockwise adjacent subunit. In that pocket, the arginine finger
(R299) is disengaged from the bound nucleotide (Fig. 3D); (iii) the
ISS motif is incorporated into the C-terminal end of the α6 helix,
thereby elongating it (Fig. 3E). Such a situation is observed in the
open pocket, where a nucleotide density is barely visible, and
both arginine fingers (R299 and R302) are retracted. Thus, based
on ISS bridge geometries, three types of nucleotide pockets can be
identified––open, closed, and intermediate, although model-based

Within the PAN-bound CP, backbone interactions are observed between the C-terminal HbYX tail of PAN and the α2
helix of CP α-subunit (SI Appendix, Fig. S6B). The backbone
nitrogen of V398 (PAN) interacts with the backbone oxygen of
G80 (CP α-subunit) while the backbone oxygen of M396 (PAN)
interacts with the backbone nitrogen of V82 (CP α2 helix). To
analyze PAN-induced structural changes in the CP, a dataset of
recombinant A. fulgidus CP was acquired as control. The control
20Sαβ, refined with C7 symmetry, resolved to 3.7 Å, and side
chains were clearly visible throughout the entire density map
(Fig. 4B and SI Appendix, Fig. S2C). We generated a model of
the control CP using the crystal structure of A. fulgidus 20Sαβ
(Protein Data Bank ID code: 1J2Q; ref. 35). Interestingly, residuewise RMSD calculations show no significant structural variation in the α-ring or inter-α-subunit pockets of the control and
PAN-bound CP (SI Appendix, Fig. S6C).
Open Gates in PAN-Proteasomes. In all five states of the PANproteasome, 20Sαβ refinements exhibit CP gates in open conformation (SI Appendix, Fig. S5D). From the isosurface view, the
gate of the control CP also appears open, although in the slice, a
smeared density is observed obstructing the pore (Fig. 4B). This
indicates that in the control CP, the flexible αN-terminal tails form
a plug, blocking the axial channel. Such a CP gate conformation
has been observed previously for the Thermoplasma acidophiulm
CP, and is regarded as a closed gate (16).
In both PAN-bound and control CP, the mouth of the CP axial
channel features a reverse turn of residues S16-P17-D18. However,
in the PAN-bound CP, an interesting feature is the “gate loop” that
is formed involving residues 8–17 at the αN terminus (Fig. 4C and
Movie S2). These loops are unique to the open gate and are not
observed in the control CP (Fig. 4D). Due to gate-loop formation,
Y8 of one α-subunit is in close proximity to P17 of the same subunit,
and D9 of the adjacent α-subunit. A cluster is thereby formed involving Y8 and P17 of one subunit and Y26 and D9 of the adjacent subunit (Fig. 4E). Such a cluster formation has been observed
previously for activated T. acidophilum and Saccharomyces cerevisiae
CP, and has been implicated in stabilization of the open gate (9, 36,
37). In the closed gate, we observe intersubunit contacts between
P17 and Y26, which probably stabilize the S16-P17-D18 reverse turn
in the axial pore (Fig. 4F and Movie S2).
All seven CP α-subunits in a PAN-proteasome show gate-loop
formation. However, for the α-subunit closest to the lowest PAN
subunit, the N-terminal tail extends toward PAN, establishing a
contact. To characterize this unique feature, we density subtracted
PSCs for each state to their respective interface models (comprising
PAN AAA ring and CP α-ring) and refined them (SI Appendix, Fig.
S5E). The connections between PAN and CP however remained
poorly resolved, and for comparison of interstate conformational
variation in the gate region, each interface reconstruction was
down-filtered to 9 Å (Fig. 4G). Interestingly, a contact between the
lowest PAN subunit and the N-terminal tail of the CP α-subunit was
consistently visible in all five states of the PAN-proteasome (Fig.
4G). The contact rotates with rotation of the split site. Since this
contact forms between the CP gate and PAN, we have named it as
“gate contact.” However, the residues involved in contact formation
could not be unambiguously identified.
Such gate contacts are not observed in case of the 26S proteasome. However, previous studies with ClpXP have shown that
the N-terminal loops of ClpP form hydrophobic contacts with
pore-2 loops of ClpX (38). Likewise, in case of the complex of
PA26-HbYX chimera with CP, the N-terminal tails of the CP
have been found to contact activation loops of PA26 (36).

Discussion
ATP Hydrolysis Cycle Around the PAN AAA Ring. We have identified
intersubunit contacts between PAN protomers, which reflect the
occupancy state of the nucleotide binding pocket. Since the pattern of

intersubunit interactions is repeatedly present in all of our five states,
we can use our results to propose a model for ATP hydrolysis around
the PAN AAA ring (Fig. 5). The intermediate pocket with ADP, and
a partially withdrawn ISS bridge, is probably the active pocket, where
ATP hydrolysis is taking place. Due to ATP hydrolysis in the P1-P2
pocket, arginine finger residues of P1 lose contact with the nucleotide, and the α6 (pore-2) and in turn α5 (pore-1) helices move upward. The ISS bridge of P1 is incorporated into its α6 helix, and a
split site (open pocket) is formed between P1 and P2, with P1 occupying the highest position and P2, the lowest position in the AAA
spiral staircase. The detachment of P1 ISS bridge from P2 signals the
commencement of ATP hydrolysis in the P2-P3 pocket, and the cycle
continues sequentially in a counterclockwise manner around the
AAA ring. In parallel, ATP is reloaded in the open pocket (now P1P2). This ensures that when ATP in the P2-P3 pocket is hydrolyzed,
and the P2 pore helices move up to the highest position in the
staircase, the P1-P2 pocket acquires a closed conformation, with the
P1 ISS bridge reestablishing contact with P2. Rotation of the spiral
staircase leads to rhythmic motions of the pore helix that, in turn,
enable the pore-loop tyrosines to propel substrates into the CP.
Various sequential, concerted, and stochastic models currently
exist that aim to link ATP hydrolysis by AAA-ATPases with
substrate unfolding and translocation (31–33, 39–42). However,
the bulk of information available is still insufficient to understand
the mechanisms completely. The present study establishes that
ATP hydrolysis occurs around the PAN AAA ring, and the model
proposed depicts the most energetically favorable route.

scheme of the conformational changes that drive the ATPase cycle around
the AAA ring. ATP hydrolysis in the active pocket causes withdrawal of the
ISS loop, and upward movement of pore helices. Detachment of ISS contact
signals the counterclockwise adjacent subunit to hydrolyze ATP.

SEE COMMENTARY

PAN and the CP, and likely plays a role in assisting substrate
translocation through the axial channel. The function of gate contacts is yet unknown. However, contacts of a similar nature have
been reported previously in ClpXP. There, the contacts vary dynamically with the nucleotide state of individual ClpX subunits,
control ATP-hydrolysis rates, and facilitate efficient protein
unfolding (38). Thus, gate contacts might be primitive means of
bipartite communication in protease-activator complexes that
have been lost with evolution.
Materials and Methods
Sample Preparation and Cryo-EM. A. fulgidus PAN and CP were recombinantly
produced in E. coli, and PAN-proteasomes were reconstituted in vitro in
presence of ATPγS. Plunge-frozen samples were imaged in a Titan Krios TEM,
equipped with a K2 direct electron detector (details in SI Appendix, SI Materials and Methods).
Image Processing and Model Building. Acquired movie frames were processed
as described in SI Appendix, SI Materials and Methods. Classification and
reconstruction was performed in Relion 2.1 (46), and structural models were
generated by molecular dynamics flexible fitting (47) (details in SI Appendix,
SI Materials and Methods).

BIOPHYSICS AND
COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY

Gate Transitions in a PAN-Proteasome. Our results show that PAN
binding stabilizes the CP gate in an open conformation. Since
gate opening is considered an outcome of HbYX tail insertion
within inter-α-subunit pockets, conformational changes at or
propagating from the HbYX binding site are likely to signal CP
activation. Interestingly, our rmsd estimates do not show a significant difference in the inter-α-subunit pockets or the α-ring of
the control and PAN-bound CP (SI Appendix, Fig. S6C).
Previous structural and biochemical studies have reported varied molecular mechanisms of CP activation (36, 43–45). However,
the consensus is the shifting of a P17 reverse turn that lines the
entry pore of the CP axial channel. The reverse turn is relocated
by either an ∼4° rigid-body rotation of the CP α-ring that results
from induced-fit conformational changes in the inter-α-subunit
pocket (45), or by subtle direct contacts between the penultimate
HbYX residue (Y/F) and G19 on the CP α-subunit (44). In our
case, with the control CP resolved at 3.7 Å, and the PAN-bound
CP resolved at 4.1 Å, it would be problematic to interpret the
1.5-Å shifts we observed in the rmsd (SI Appendix, Fig. S6C). We
prefer the latter model, whereby only subtle signals are involved,
without major induced-fit conformational changes.
In PAN-proteasomes, a unique feature of CP gates is the gate
contacts, which rotate in concert with the AAA staircase. This hints
at an allosteric communication of ATP hydrolysis state between
