Overall, the dimeric structure resembles those of other MarR proteins, with each subunit comprising a winged helix-turn-helix (wHtH) domain connected to an alpha-helical dimerization domain. The spacing of the recognition helices of the wHtH domain indicates that NMB1585 is pre-configured for DNA binding, with a putative inducer pocket that is largely occluded by the side chains of two aromatic residues (Tyr29 and Trp53). NMB1585 was shown to bind to its own promoter region in a gel-shift assay, indicating that the protein acts as an auto-repressor.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Nichols","full_name":"Nichols CE","initials":"CE"},{"last_name":"Sainsbury","full_name":"Sainsbury S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Ren","full_name":"Ren J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Walter","full_name":"Walter TS","initials":"TS"},{"last_name":"Verma","full_name":"Verma A","initials":"A"},{"last_name":"Stammers","full_name":"Stammers DK","initials":"DK"},{"last_name":"Saunders","full_name":"Saunders NJ","initials":"NJ"},{"last_name":"Owens","full_name":"Owens RJ","initials":"RJ"}],"title":"The structure of NMB1585, a MarR-family regulator from Neisseria meningitidis.","pubmed_id":"19255465","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1107/S174430910900414X"}]}
