This study focuses on the molecular chaperone ClpB, the bacterial homologue of Hsp104, which reactivates aggregated proteins under cellular stress conditions. Based on high-resolution crystal structures in different nucleotide states, mutational analysis and nucleotide-binding kinetics experiments, the ATPase cycle of the C-terminal nucleotide-binding domain (NBD2), one of the motor subunits of this AAA+ disaggregation machine, is dissected mechanistically. The results provide insights into nucleotide sensing, explaining how the conserved sensor 2 motif contributes to the discrimination between ADP and ATP binding. Furthermore, the role of a conserved active-site arginine (Arg621), which controls binding of the essential Mg(2+) ion, is described. Finally, a hypothesis is presented as to how the ATPase activity is regulated by a conformational switch that involves the essential Walker A lysine. In the proposed model, an unusual side-chain conformation of this highly conserved residue stabilizes a catalytically inactive state, thereby avoiding unnecessary ATP hydrolysis.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Zeymer","full_name":"Zeymer C","initials":"C"},{"last_name":"Barends","full_name":"Barends TR","initials":"TR"},{"last_name":"Werbeck","full_name":"Werbeck ND","initials":"ND"},{"last_name":"Schlichting","full_name":"Schlichting I","initials":"I"},{"last_name":"Reinstein","full_name":"Reinstein J","initials":"J"}],"title":"Elements in nucleotide sensing and hydrolysis of the AAA+ disaggregation machine ClpB: a structure-based mechanistic dissection of a molecular motor.","pubmed_id":"24531492","type":"J","associated_entries":"4lj4, 4lj5, 4lj6, 4lj8, 4lj9, 4lja","doi":"10.1107/S1399004713030629"}]}
