The 2.1 angstrom crystal structure of Zalpha complexed to DNA reveals that the substrate is in the left-handed Z conformation. The contacts between Zalpha and Z-DNA are made primarily with the \"zigzag\" sugar-phosphate backbone, which provides a basis for the specificity for the Z conformation. A single base contact is observed to guanine in the syn conformation, characteristic of Z-DNA. Intriguingly, the helix-turn-helix motif, frequently used to recognize B-DNA, is used by Zalpha to contact Z-DNA.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Schwartz","full_name":"Schwartz T","initials":"T"},{"last_name":"Rould","full_name":"Rould MA","initials":"MA"},{"last_name":"Lowenhaupt","full_name":"Lowenhaupt K","initials":"K"},{"last_name":"Herbert","full_name":"Herbert A","initials":"A"},{"last_name":"Rich","full_name":"Rich A","initials":"A"}],"pubmed_id":"10364558","type":"J"}]}
