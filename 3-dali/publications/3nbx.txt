We recently found that the Escherichia coli MoxR protein, RavA (Regulatory ATPase variant A), tightly interacts with the inducible lysine decarboxylase, LdcI/CadA, to form a unique cage-like structure. Here, we present the X-ray structure of RavA and show that the \u03b1\u03b2\u03b1 and all-\u03b1 subdomains in the RavA AAA+ module are arranged as in magnesium chelatases rather than as in classical AAA+ proteins. RavA structure also contains a discontinuous triple-helical domain as well as a \u03b2-barrel-like domain forming a unique fold, which we termed the LARA domain. The LARA domain was found to mediate the interaction between RavA and LdcI. The RavA structure provides insights into how five RavA hexamers interact with two LdcI decamers to form the RavA-LdcI cage-like structure.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"El Bakkouri","full_name":"El Bakkouri M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Gutsche","full_name":"Gutsche I","initials":"I"},{"last_name":"Kanjee","full_name":"Kanjee U","initials":"U"},{"last_name":"Zhao","full_name":"Zhao B","initials":"B"},{"last_name":"Yu","full_name":"Yu M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Goret","full_name":"Goret G","initials":"G"},{"last_name":"Schoehn","full_name":"Schoehn G","initials":"G"},{"last_name":"Burmeister","full_name":"Burmeister WP","initials":"WP"},{"last_name":"Houry","full_name":"Houry WA","initials":"WA"}],"title":"Structure of RavA MoxR AAA+ protein reveals the design principles of a molecular cage modulating the inducible lysine decarboxylase activity.","pubmed_id":"21148420","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1073/pnas.1009092107"}]}
