ScPif1p is involved in the maintenance of mitochondrial, ribosomal and telomeric DNA and suppresses genome instability at G-quadruplex motifs. Here, we report the crystal structures of a truncated ScPif1p (ScPif1p237-780) in complex with different ssDNAs. Our results have revealed that a yeast-specific insertion domain protruding from the 2B domain folds as a bundle bearing an \u03b1-helix, \u03b116. The \u03b116 helix regulates the helicase activities of ScPif1p through interactions with the previously identified loop3. Furthermore, a biologically relevant dimeric structure has been identified, which can be further specifically stabilized by G-quadruplex DNA. Basing on structural analyses and mutational studies with DNA binding and unwinding assays, a potential G-quadruplex DNA binding site in ScPif1p monomers is suggested. Our results also show that ScPif1p uses the Q-motif to preferentially hydrolyze ATP, and a G-rich tract is preferentially recognized by more residues, consistent with previous biochemical observations. These findings provide a structural and mechanistic basis for understanding the multifunctional ScPif1p.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Lu","full_name":"Lu KY","initials":"KY"},{"last_name":"Chen","full_name":"Chen WF","initials":"WF"},{"last_name":"Rety","full_name":"Rety S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Liu","full_name":"Liu NN","initials":"NN"},{"last_name":"Wu","full_name":"Wu WQ","initials":"WQ"},{"last_name":"Dai","full_name":"Dai YX","initials":"YX"},{"last_name":"Li","full_name":"Li D","initials":"D"},{"last_name":"Ma","full_name":"Ma HY","initials":"HY"},{"last_name":"Dou","full_name":"Dou SX","initials":"SX"},{"last_name":"Xi","full_name":"Xi XG","initials":"XG"}],"title":"Insights into the structural and mechanistic basis of multifunctional S. cerevisiae Pif1p helicase.","pubmed_id":"29202194","type":"J","associated_entries":"5o6d, 5o6e","doi":"10.1093/nar/gkx1217"}]}
