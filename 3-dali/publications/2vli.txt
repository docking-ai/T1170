The D. radiodurans ORF DR_1419 was cloned and expressed; the protein TmrD was crystallized and its X-ray crystal structure was determined to 1.95 A resolution. The structure was determined using single-wavelength anomalous diffraction with selenomethionine-derivatized protein. The refined structure is the first to be reported for a member of the tunicamycin-resistance family. It reveals strong structural similarity to the family of nucleoside monophosphate kinases and to the chloramphenicol phosphotransferase of Streptomyces venezuelae, suggesting that the mode of action is possibly by phosphorylation of tunicamycin.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Kapp","full_name":"Kapp U","initials":"U"},{"last_name":"Macedo","full_name":"Macedo S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Hall","full_name":"Hall DR","initials":"DR"},{"last_name":"Leiros","full_name":"Leiros I","initials":"I"},{"last_name":"McSweeney","full_name":"McSweeney SM","initials":"SM"},{"last_name":"Mitchell","full_name":"Mitchell E","initials":"E"}],"title":"Structure of Deinococcus radiodurans tunicamycin-resistance protein (TmrD), a phosphotransferase.","pubmed_id":"18540055","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1107/S1744309108011822"}]}
