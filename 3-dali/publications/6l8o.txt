Here, we present the crystal structure of a nearly full-length Rad5 protein. The structure shows three distinct, but well-connected, domains required for Rad5's activities. The spatial arrangement of these domains suggest that different domains can have autonomous activities but also undergo intrinsic coordination. Moreover, our structural, biochemical and cellular studies demonstrate that Rad5's HIRAN domain mediates interactions with the DNA metabolism maestro factor PCNA and contributes to its poly-ubiquitination, binds to DNA and contributes to the Rad5-catalyzed replication fork regression, defining a new type of HIRAN domains with multiple activities. Our work provides a framework to understand how Rad5 integrates its various activities in replication stress tolerance.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Shen","full_name":"Shen M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Dhingra","full_name":"Dhingra N","initials":"N"},{"last_name":"Wang","full_name":"Wang Q","initials":"Q"},{"last_name":"Cheng","full_name":"Cheng C","initials":"C"},{"last_name":"Zhu","full_name":"Zhu S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Tian","full_name":"Tian X","initials":"X"},{"last_name":"Yu","full_name":"Yu J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Gong","full_name":"Gong X","initials":"X"},{"last_name":"Li","full_name":"Li X","initials":"X"},{"last_name":"Zhang","full_name":"Zhang H","initials":"H"},{"last_name":"Xu","full_name":"Xu X","initials":"X"},{"last_name":"Zhai","full_name":"Zhai L","initials":"L"},{"last_name":"Xie","full_name":"Xie M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Gao","full_name":"Gao Y","initials":"Y"},{"last_name":"Deng","full_name":"Deng H","initials":"H"},{"last_name":"He","full_name":"He Y","initials":"Y"},{"last_name":"Niu","full_name":"Niu H","initials":"H"},{"last_name":"Zhao","full_name":"Zhao X","initials":"X"},{"last_name":"Xiang","full_name":"Xiang S","initials":"S"}],"title":"Structural basis for the multi-activity factor Rad5 in replication stress tolerance.","pubmed_id":"33436623","type":"J","associated_entries":"6l8n","doi":"10.1007/978-1-59745-566-4_6"}]}
