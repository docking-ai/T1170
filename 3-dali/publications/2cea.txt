Orthologs exist in chloroplasts and mitochondria, where in humans the loss of a close FtsH-homolog causes a form of spastic paraplegia. FtsH plays a crucial role in quality control by degrading unneeded or damaged membrane proteins, but it also targets soluble signaling factors like sigma(32) and lambda-CII. We report here the crystal structure of a soluble FtsH construct that is functional in caseinolytic and ATPase assays. The molecular architecture of this hexameric molecule consists of two rings where the protease domains possess an all-helical fold and form a flat hexagon that is covered by a toroid built by the AAA domains. The active site of the protease classifies FtsH as an Asp-zincin, contrary to a previous report. The different symmetries of protease and AAA rings suggest a possible translocation mechanism of the target polypeptide chain into the interior of the molecule where the proteolytic sites are located.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Bieniossek","full_name":"Bieniossek C","initials":"C"},{"last_name":"Schalch","full_name":"Schalch T","initials":"T"},{"last_name":"Bumann","full_name":"Bumann M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Meister","full_name":"Meister M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Meier","full_name":"Meier R","initials":"R"},{"last_name":"Baumann","full_name":"Baumann U","initials":"U"}],"title":"The molecular architecture of the metalloprotease FtsH.","pubmed_id":"16484367","type":"J","associated_entries":"2ce7","doi":"10.1073/pnas.0600031103"}]}
