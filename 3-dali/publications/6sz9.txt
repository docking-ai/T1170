Essential to the recruitment and delivery of effectors to the T4S machinery is the membrane-embedded T4 coupling complex (T4CC). Here, we purify an intact T4CC from the Legionella membrane. It contains the DotL ATPase, the DotM and DotN proteins, the chaperone module IcmSW, and two previously uncharacterised proteins, DotY and DotZ. The atomic resolution structure reveals a DotLMNYZ hetero-pentameric core from which the flexible IcmSW module protrudes. Six of these hetero-pentameric complexes may assemble into a 1.6-MDa hexameric nanomachine, forming an inner membrane channel for effectors to pass through. Analysis of multiple cryo EM maps, further modelling and mutagenesis provide working models for the mechanism for binding and delivery of two essential classes of Legionella effectors, depending on IcmSW or DotM, respectively.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Meir","full_name":"Meir A","initials":"A"},{"last_name":"Mac\u00e9","full_name":"Mac\u00e9 K","initials":"K"},{"last_name":"Lukoyanova","full_name":"Lukoyanova N","initials":"N"},{"last_name":"Chetrit","full_name":"Chetrit D","initials":"D"},{"last_name":"Hospenthal","full_name":"Hospenthal MK","initials":"MK"},{"last_name":"Redzej","full_name":"Redzej A","initials":"A"},{"last_name":"Roy","full_name":"Roy C","initials":"C"},{"last_name":"Waksman","full_name":"Waksman G","initials":"G"}],"pubmed_id":"32513920","type":"J"}]}
