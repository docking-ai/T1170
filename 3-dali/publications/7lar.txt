The replicase (Rep) from these viruses is responsible for initiating rolling circle replication (RCR) of their genomes. Rep is a multifunctional enzyme responsible for nicking and ligating ssDNA and unwinding double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). We report the structure of porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) Rep bound to ADP and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), and Rep bound to ADP and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). The structures demonstrate Rep to be a member of the superfamily 3 (SF3) of ATPases Associated with diverse cellular Activities (AAA","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Tarasova","full_name":"Tarasova E","initials":"E"},{"last_name":"Dhindwal","full_name":"Dhindwal S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Popp","full_name":"Popp M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Hussain","full_name":"Hussain S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Khayat","full_name":"Khayat R","initials":"R"}],"title":"Mechanism of DNA Interaction and Translocation by the Replicase of a Circular Rep-Encoding Single-Stranded DNA Virus.","pubmed_id":"34311576","type":"J","associated_entries":"7las","doi":"10.1128/mBio.00763-21"}]}
