Two single-pass membrane proteins, HflK and HflC, interact with FtsH to modulate its proteolytic activity. Here, we present structure of the entire FtsH-HflKC complex, comprising 12 copies of both HflK and HflC, all of which interact reciprocally to form a cage, as well as four FtsH hexamers with periplasmic domains and transmembrane helices enclosed inside the cage and cytoplasmic domains situated at the base of the cage. FtsH K61/D62/S63 in the \u03b22-\u03b23 loop in the periplasmic domain directly interact with HflK, contributing to complex formation. Pull-down and in\u00a0vivo enzymatic activity assays validate the importance of the interacting interface for FtsH-HflKC complex formation. Structural comparison with the substrate-bound human m-AAA protease AFG3L2 offers implications for the HflKC cage in modulating substrate access to FtsH. Together, our findings provide a better understanding of FtsH-type AAA protease holoenzyme assembly and regulation.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Qiao","full_name":"Qiao Z","initials":"Z"},{"last_name":"Yokoyama","full_name":"Yokoyama T","initials":"T"},{"last_name":"Yan","full_name":"Yan XF","initials":"XF"},{"last_name":"Beh","full_name":"Beh IT","initials":"IT"},{"last_name":"Shi","full_name":"Shi J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Basak","full_name":"Basak S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Akiyama","full_name":"Akiyama Y","initials":"Y"},{"last_name":"Gao","full_name":"Gao YG","initials":"YG"}],"pubmed_id":"35649372","type":"J"}]}
