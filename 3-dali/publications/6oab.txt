How Cdc48 processes its diverse and often well-folded substrates is unclear. Here, we report cryo-EM structures of the Cdc48 ATPase in complex with Ufd1/Npl4 and poly-ubiquitinated substrate. The structures show that the Cdc48 complex initiates substrate processing by unfolding a ubiquitin molecule. The unfolded ubiquitin molecule binds to Npl4 and projects its N-terminal segment through both hexameric ATPase rings. Pore loops of the second ring form a staircase that acts as a conveyer belt to move the polypeptide through the central pore. Inducing the unfolding of ubiquitin allows the Cdc48 ATPase complex to process a broad range of substrates.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Twomey","full_name":"Twomey EC","initials":"EC"},{"last_name":"Ji","full_name":"Ji Z","initials":"Z"},{"last_name":"Wales","full_name":"Wales TE","initials":"TE"},{"last_name":"Bodnar","full_name":"Bodnar NO","initials":"NO"},{"last_name":"Ficarro","full_name":"Ficarro SB","initials":"SB"},{"last_name":"Marto","full_name":"Marto JA","initials":"JA"},{"last_name":"Engen","full_name":"Engen JR","initials":"JR"},{"last_name":"Rapoport","full_name":"Rapoport TA","initials":"TA"}],"title":"Substrate processing by the Cdc48 ATPase complex is initiated by ubiquitin unfolding.","pubmed_id":"31249135","type":"J","associated_entries":"6oa9, 6oaa","doi":"10.1126/science.aax1033"}]}
