The GTPase itself is activated by McrC. The architecture of the GTPase and nuclease complex, and the mechanism of their activation remained unknown. Here, we report a 3.6\u2009\u00c5 structure of a GTPase-active and DNA-binding deficient construct of McrBC. Two hexameric rings of McrB are bridged by McrC dimer. McrC interacts asymmetrically with McrB protomers and inserts a stalk into the pore of the ring, reminiscent of the \u03b3 subunit complexed to \u03b1<sub>3</sub>\u03b2<sub>3</sub> of F<sub>1</sub>-ATPase. Activation of the GTPase involves conformational changes of residues essential for hydrolysis. Three consecutive nucleotide-binding pockets are occupied by the GTP analogue 5'-guanylyl imidodiphosphate and the next three by GDP, which is suggestive of sequential GTP hydrolysis.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Nirwan","full_name":"Nirwan N","initials":"N"},{"last_name":"Itoh","full_name":"Itoh Y","initials":"Y"},{"last_name":"Singh","full_name":"Singh P","initials":"P"},{"last_name":"Bandyopadhyay","full_name":"Bandyopadhyay S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Vinothkumar","full_name":"Vinothkumar KR","initials":"KR"},{"last_name":"Amunts","full_name":"Amunts A","initials":"A"},{"last_name":"Saikrishnan","full_name":"Saikrishnan K","initials":"K"}],"title":"Structure-based mechanism for activation of the AAA+ GTPase McrB by the endonuclease McrC.","pubmed_id":"31296862","type":"J","associated_entries":"6hz4, 6hz5, 6hz6, 6hz7, 6hz8","doi":"10.1038/s41467-019-11084-1"}]}
