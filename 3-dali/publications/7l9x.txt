Here, we identify a triazolopyridine-based fragment that binds the AAA domain of human katanin, a microtubule-severing protein. We have developed a model for compound binding and designed ASPIR-1 (allele-specific, proximity-induced reactivity-based inhibitor-1), a cell-permeable compound that selectively inhibits katanin with an engineered cysteine mutation. Only in cells expressing mutant katanin does ASPIR-1 treatment increase the accumulation of CAMSAP2 at microtubule minus ends, confirming specific on-target cellular activity. Importantly, ASPIR-1 also selectively inhibits engineered cysteine mutants of human VPS4B and FIGL1-AAA proteins, involved in organelle dynamics and genome stability, respectively. Structural studies confirm our model for compound binding at the AAA ATPase site and the proximity-induced reactivity-based inhibition. Together, our findings suggest a chemical genetics approach to decipher AAA protein functions across essential cellular processes and to test hypotheses for developing therapeutics.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Cupido","full_name":"Cupido T","initials":"T"},{"last_name":"Jones","full_name":"Jones NH","initials":"NH"},{"last_name":"Grasso","full_name":"Grasso MJ","initials":"MJ"},{"last_name":"Pisa","full_name":"Pisa R","initials":"R"},{"last_name":"Kapoor","full_name":"Kapoor TM","initials":"TM"}],"title":"A chemical genetics approach to examine the functions of AAA proteins.","pubmed_id":"33782614","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1038/s41594-021-00575-9"}]}
