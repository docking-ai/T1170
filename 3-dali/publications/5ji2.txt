The L199Q I-domain substitution, which was originally reported as a loss-of-function mutation, resides in a segment that appears to adopt multiple conformations as electron density is not observed in HslU and HslUV crystal structures. The L199Q sequence change does not alter the structure of the AAA+ ring or its interactions with HslV but increases I-domain susceptibility to limited endoproteolysis. Notably, the L199Q mutation increases the rate of ATP hydrolysis substantially, results in slower degradation of some proteins but faster degradation of other substrates, and markedly changes the preference of HslUV for initiating degradation at the N or C terminus of model substrates. Thus, a structurally dynamic region of the I domain plays a key role in controlling protein degradation by HslUV.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Baytshtok","full_name":"Baytshtok V","initials":"V"},{"last_name":"Fei","full_name":"Fei X","initials":"X"},{"last_name":"Grant","full_name":"Grant RA","initials":"RA"},{"last_name":"Baker","full_name":"Baker TA","initials":"TA"},{"last_name":"Sauer","full_name":"Sauer RT","initials":"RT"}],"pubmed_id":"27667691","type":"J"},{"journal_info":{"volume":"9","pdb_abbreviation":"Structure","ISO_abbreviation":"Structure","year":2001,"issue":"2","pages":"177-84"},"doi":null,"associated_entries":"1g4a, 1g4b, 5ji3","title":"Crystal structures of the HslVU peptidase-ATPase complex reveal an ATP-dependent proteolysis mechanism.","abstract":{"methods":null,"conclusions":"Analysis of nucleotide binding induced conformational changes in the current and previous HslU structures suggests a protein unfolding-coupled translocation mechanism. In this mechanism, unfolded polypeptides are threaded through the aligned pores of the ATPase and peptidase and translocated into the peptidase central chamber.","results":"We present a 3.0 A resolution crystal structure of HslVU with an HslU hexamer bound at one end of an HslV dodecamer. The structure shows that the central pores of the ATPase and peptidase are next to each other and aligned. The central pore of HslU consists of a GYVG motif, which is conserved among protease-associated ATPases. The binding of one HslU hexamer to one end of an HslV dodecamer in the 3.0 A resolution structure opens both HslV central pores and induces asymmetric changes in HslV.","unassigned":null,"background":"The bacterial heat shock locus HslU ATPase and HslV peptidase together form an ATP-dependent HslVU protease. Bacterial HslVU is a homolog of the eukaryotic 26S proteasome. Crystallographic studies of HslVU should provide an understanding of ATP-dependent protein unfolding, translocation, and proteolysis by this and other ATP-dependent proteases.","objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Wang","full_name":"Wang J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Song","full_name":"Song JJ","initials":"JJ"},{"last_name":"Franklin","full_name":"Franklin MC","initials":"MC"},{"last_name":"Kamtekar","full_name":"Kamtekar S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Im","full_name":"Im YJ","initials":"YJ"},{"last_name":"Rho","full_name":"Rho SH","initials":"SH"},{"last_name":"Seong","full_name":"Seong IS","initials":"IS"},{"last_name":"Lee","full_name":"Lee CS","initials":"CS"},{"last_name":"Chung","full_name":"Chung CH","initials":"CH"},{"last_name":"Eom","full_name":"Eom SH","initials":"SH"}],"pubmed_id":"11250202","type":"J"}]}
