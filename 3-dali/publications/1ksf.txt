The crystal structure of the ClpA subunit reveals an N-terminal domain with pseudo-twofold symmetry and two AAA(+) modules (D1 and D2) each consisting of a large and a small sub-domain with ADP bound in the sub-domain junction. The N-terminal domain interacts with the D1 domain in a manner similar to adaptor-binding domains of other AAA(+) proteins. D1 and D2 are connected head-to-tail consistent with a cooperative and vectorial translocation of protein substrates. In a planar hexamer model of ClpA, built by assembling ClpA D1 and D2 into homohexameric rings of known structures of AAA(+) modules, the differences in D1-D1 and D2-D2 interfaces correlate with their respective contributions to hexamer stability and ATPase activity.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Guo","full_name":"Guo F","initials":"F"},{"last_name":"Maurizi","full_name":"Maurizi MR","initials":"MR"},{"last_name":"Esser","full_name":"Esser L","initials":"L"},{"last_name":"Xia","full_name":"Xia D","initials":"D"}],"title":"Crystal structure of ClpA, an Hsp100 chaperone and regulator of ClpAP protease.","pubmed_id":"12205096","type":"J","associated_entries":"1k6k","doi":"10.1074/jbc.M207796200"}]}
