This enzyme has an N-terminal transmembrane segment and a C-terminal cytosolic region consisting of an AAA+ ATPase domain and a protease domain. Here we present two crystal structures: the protease domain and the whole cytosolic region. The cytosolic region fully retains an ATP-dependent protease activity and adopts a three-fold-symmetric hexameric structure. The protease domains displayed a six-fold symmetry, while the AAA+ domains, each containing ADP, alternate two orientations relative to the protease domain, making \"open\" and \"closed\" interdomain contacts. Apparently, ATPase is active only in the closed form, and protease operates in the open form. The protease catalytic sites are accessible only through a tunnel following from the AAA+ domain of the adjacent subunit, raising a possibility of translocation of polypeptide substrate to the protease sites through this tunnel.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Suno","full_name":"Suno R","initials":"R"},{"last_name":"Niwa","full_name":"Niwa H","initials":"H"},{"last_name":"Tsuchiya","full_name":"Tsuchiya D","initials":"D"},{"last_name":"Zhang","full_name":"Zhang X","initials":"X"},{"last_name":"Yoshida","full_name":"Yoshida M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Morikawa","full_name":"Morikawa K","initials":"K"}],"title":"Structure of the whole cytosolic region of ATP-dependent protease FtsH.","pubmed_id":"16762831","type":"J","associated_entries":"1ixz, 1iy0, 1iy1, 1iy2, 2di4, 4eiw","doi":"10.1016/j.molcel.2006.04.020"},{"journal_info":{"volume":"10","pdb_abbreviation":"Structure","ISO_abbreviation":"Structure","year":2002,"issue":"10","pages":"1415-23"},"abstract":{"methods":null,"conclusions":null,"results":null,"unassigned":"FtsH is a cytoplasmic membrane-integrated, ATP-dependent metalloprotease, which processively degrades both cytoplasmic and membrane proteins in concert with unfolding. The FtsH protein is divided into the N-terminal transmembrane region and the larger C-terminal cytoplasmic region, which consists of an ATPase domain and a protease domain. We have determined the crystal structures of the Thermus thermophilus FtsH ATPase domain in the nucleotide-free and AMP-PNP- and ADP-bound states, in addition to the domain with the extra preceding segment. Combined with the mapping of the putative substrate binding region, these structures suggest that FtsH internally forms a hexameric ring structure, in which ATP binding could cause a conformational change to facilitate transport of substrates into the protease domain through the central pore.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Niwa","full_name":"Niwa H","initials":"H"},{"last_name":"Tsuchiya","full_name":"Tsuchiya D","initials":"D"},{"last_name":"Makyio","full_name":"Makyio H","initials":"H"},{"last_name":"Yoshida","full_name":"Yoshida M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Morikawa","full_name":"Morikawa K","initials":"K"}],"title":"Hexameric ring structure of the ATPase domain of the membrane-integrated metalloprotease FtsH from Thermus thermophilus HB8.","pubmed_id":"12377127","type":"J","associated_entries":"1ixz, 1iy0, 1iy1, 1iy2, 2di4, 4eiw","doi":"10.1016/S0969-2126(02)00855-9"}]}
