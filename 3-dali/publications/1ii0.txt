Binding of different nucleotides modifies the coordination sphere of Mg(2+). In particular, the changes elicited by ADP.AlF(3) provide insights into the mechanism of ATP hydrolysis. In-line attack by water onto the gamma-phosphate of ATP would be followed first by formation of a trigonal intermediate and then by breaking of the scissile bond between the beta- and gamma-phosphates. Motions of amino acid side chains at the A2 nucleotide binding site during ATP binding and hydrolysis propagate at a distance, producing conformational changes in four different regions of the protein corresponding to helices H4-H5, helices H9-H10, helices H13-H15, and to the S1-H2-S2 region. These elements are extensions of, respectively, the Switch I and Switch II regions, the A-loop (a small loop near the nucleotide adenine moiety), and the P-loop. Based on the observed conformational changes, it is proposed that ArsA functions as a reciprocating engine that hydrolyzes 2 mol of ATP per each cycle of ion translocation across the membrane.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Zhou","full_name":"Zhou T","initials":"T"},{"last_name":"Radaev","full_name":"Radaev S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Rosen","full_name":"Rosen BP","initials":"BP"},{"last_name":"Gatti","full_name":"Gatti DL","initials":"DL"}],"title":"Conformational changes in four regions of the Escherichia coli ArsA ATPase link ATP hydrolysis to ion translocation.","pubmed_id":"11395509","type":"J","associated_entries":"1ihu, 1ii9","doi":"10.1074/jbc.M103671200"}]}
