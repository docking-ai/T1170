SmARG is a binuclear manganese metalloenzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of l-arginine to form l-ornithine and urea, and this enzyme is upregulated in all forms of the parasite that interact with the human host. Current hypotheses suggest that parasitic arginases could play a role in host immune evasion by depleting pools of substrate l-arginine that would otherwise be utilized for NO biosynthesis and NO-dependent processes in the immune response. Although the amino acid sequence of SmARG is only 42% identical with that of human arginase I, residues important for substrate binding and catalysis are strictly conserved. In general, classical amino acid inhibitors such as 2(S)-amino-6-boronohexanoic acid (ABH) tend to bind more weakly to SmARG than to human arginase I despite identical inhibitor binding modes in each enzyme active site. The identification of a patch on the enzyme surface capable of accommodating the additional C\u03b1 substitutent of an \u03b1,\u03b1-disubstituted amino acid inhibitor suggests that such inhibitors could exhibit higher affinity and biological activity. The structures of SmARG complexed with two different \u03b1,\u03b1-disubstituted derivatives of ABH are presented and provide a proof of concept for this approach in the enhancement of enzyme-inhibitor affinity.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Hai","full_name":"Hai Y","initials":"Y"},{"last_name":"Edwards","full_name":"Edwards JE","initials":"JE"},{"last_name":"Van Zandt","full_name":"Van Zandt MC","initials":"MC"},{"last_name":"Hoffmann","full_name":"Hoffmann KF","initials":"KF"},{"last_name":"Christianson","full_name":"Christianson DW","initials":"DW"}],"title":"Crystal Structure of Schistosoma mansoni Arginase, a Potential Drug Target for the Treatment of Schistosomiasis.","pubmed_id":"25007099","type":"J","associated_entries":"4q3p, 4q3q, 4q3r, 4q3s, 4q3t, 4q3u, 4q40, 4q41, 4q42","doi":"10.1021/bi5004519"}]}
