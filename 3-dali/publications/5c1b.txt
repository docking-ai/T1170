Most of the cofactors interact with the N-terminal (N) domain of p97, either via ubiquitin-like domains or short linear binding motifs. While some linear binding motifs form \u03b1 helices, another group features short stretches of unstructured hydrophobic sequences as found in the so-called SHP (BS1, binding segment 1) motif. Here we present the crystal structure of a SHP-binding motif in complex with p97, which reveals a so far uncharacterized binding site on the p97\u00a0N domain that is different from the conserved binding surface of all other known p97 cofactors. This finding explains how cofactors like UFD1/NPL4 and p47 can utilize a bipartite binding mechanism to interact simultaneously with the same p97 monomer via their ubiquitin-like domain and SHP motif.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"H\u00e4nzelmann","full_name":"H\u00e4nzelmann P","initials":"P"},{"last_name":"Schindelin","full_name":"Schindelin H","initials":"H"}],"title":"Characterization of an Additional Binding Surface on the p97 N-Terminal Domain Involved in Bipartite Cofactor Interactions.","pubmed_id":"26712280","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1016/j.str.2015.10.027"}]}
