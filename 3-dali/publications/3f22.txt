The binding of Z alpha to foreign or chromosomal DNA in various sequence contexts is known to influence various biological functions, including the DNA-mediated innate immune response and transcriptional modulation of gene expression. For these reasons, understanding its binding mode and the conformational diversity of Z alpha bound Z-DNAs is of considerable importance. However, structural studies of Z alpha bound Z-DNA have been mostly limited to standard CG-repeat DNAs. Here, we have solved the crystal structures of three representative non-CG repeat DNAs, d(CACGTG)(2), d(CGTACG)(2) and d(CGGCCG)(2) complexed to hZ alpha(ADAR1) and compared those structures with that of hZ alpha(ADAR1)/d(CGCGCG)(2) and the Z alpha-free Z-DNAs. hZ alpha(ADAR1) bound to each of the three Z-DNAs showed a well conserved binding mode with very limited structural deviation irrespective of the DNA sequence, although varying numbers of residues were in contact with Z-DNA. Z-DNAs display less structural alterations in the Z alpha-bound state than in their free form, thereby suggesting that conformational diversities of Z-DNAs are restrained by the binding pocket of Z alpha. These data suggest that Z-DNAs are recognized by Z alpha through common conformational features regardless of the sequence and structural alterations.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Ha","full_name":"Ha SC","initials":"SC"},{"last_name":"Choi","full_name":"Choi J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Hwang","full_name":"Hwang HY","initials":"HY"},{"last_name":"Rich","full_name":"Rich A","initials":"A"},{"last_name":"Kim","full_name":"Kim YG","initials":"YG"},{"last_name":"Kim","full_name":"Kim KK","initials":"KK"}],"title":"The structures of non-CG-repeat Z-DNAs co-crystallized with the Z-DNA-binding domain, hZ alpha(ADAR1).","pubmed_id":"19074195","type":"J","associated_entries":"3f21, 3f23","doi":"10.1093/nar/gkn976"}]}
