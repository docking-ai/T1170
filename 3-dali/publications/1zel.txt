It is further fueled by the HIV pandemic and by increasing incidences of multidrug resistant Mtb-strains. Rv2827c, a hypothetical protein from Mtb, has been implicated in the survival of Mtb in the macrophages of the host. The three-dimensional structure of Rv2827c has been determined by the three-wavelength anomalous diffraction technique using bromide-derivatized crystals and refined to a resolution of 1.93 A. The asymmetric unit of the orthorhombic crystals contains two independent protein molecules related by a non-crystallographic translation. The tertiary structure of Rv2827c comprises two domains: an N-terminal domain displaying a winged helix topology and a C-terminal domain, which appears to constitute a new and unique fold. Based on structural homology considerations and additional biochemical evidence, it could be established that Rv2827c is a DNA-binding protein. Once the understanding of the structure-function relationship of Rv2827c extends to the function of Rv2827c in vivo, new clues for the rational design of novel intervention strategies may be obtained.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Janowski","full_name":"Janowski R","initials":"R"},{"last_name":"Panjikar","full_name":"Panjikar S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Eddine","full_name":"Eddine AN","initials":"AN"},{"last_name":"Kaufmann","full_name":"Kaufmann SH","initials":"SH"},{"last_name":"Weiss","full_name":"Weiss MS","initials":"MS"}],"pubmed_id":"19184528","type":"J"}]}
