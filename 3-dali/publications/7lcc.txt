Although most eukaryotic transposases form oligomers and use RNase H-like domains to break and rejoin double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), Helitron transposases contain a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-specific HUH endonuclease domain. Here, we report the cryo-electron microscopy structure of a Helitron transposase bound to the 5'-transposon end, providing insight into its multidomain architecture and function. The monomeric transposase forms a tightly packed assembly that buries the covalently attached cleaved end, protecting it until the second end becomes available. The structure reveals unexpected architectural similarity to TraI, a bacterial relaxase that also catalyzes ssDNA movement. The HUH active site suggests how two juxtaposed tyrosines, a feature of many replication initiators that use HUH nucleases, couple the conformational shift of an \u03b1-helix to control strand cleavage and ligation reactions.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Kosek","full_name":"Kosek D","initials":"D"},{"last_name":"Grabundzija","full_name":"Grabundzija I","initials":"I"},{"last_name":"Lei","full_name":"Lei H","initials":"H"},{"last_name":"Bilic","full_name":"Bilic I","initials":"I"},{"last_name":"Wang","full_name":"Wang H","initials":"H"},{"last_name":"Jin","full_name":"Jin Y","initials":"Y"},{"last_name":"Peaslee","full_name":"Peaslee GF","initials":"GF"},{"last_name":"Hickman","full_name":"Hickman AB","initials":"AB"},{"last_name":"Dyda","full_name":"Dyda F","initials":"F"}],"title":"The large bat Helitron DNA transposase forms a compact monomeric assembly that buries and protects its covalently bound 5'-transposon end.","pubmed_id":"34403695","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1016/j.molcel.2021.07.028"}]}
