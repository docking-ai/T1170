The 9-1-1 clamp is a heterotrimeric ring that is loaded in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by Rad24-RFC (hRAD17-RFC), an alternate clamp loader in which Rad24 replaces Rfc1 in the RFC1-5 clamp loader of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). The 9-1-1 clamp loading mechanism has been a mystery, because, unlike RFC, which loads PCNA onto a 3'-recessed junction, Rad24-RFC loads the 9-1-1 ring onto a 5'-recessed DNA junction. Here we report two cryo-EM structures of Rad24-RFC-DNA with a closed or 27-\u00c5 open 9-1-1 clamp. The structures reveal a completely unexpected mechanism by which a clamp can be loaded onto DNA. Unlike RFC, which encircles DNA, Rad24 binds 5'-DNA on its surface, not inside the loader, and threads the 3' ssDNA overhang into the 9-1-1 clamp from above the ring.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Zheng","full_name":"Zheng F","initials":"F"},{"last_name":"Georgescu","full_name":"Georgescu RE","initials":"RE"},{"last_name":"Yao","full_name":"Yao NY","initials":"NY"},{"last_name":"O'Donnell","full_name":"O'Donnell ME","initials":"ME"},{"last_name":"Li","full_name":"Li H","initials":"H"}],"title":"DNA is loaded through the 9-1-1 DNA checkpoint clamp in the opposite direction of the PCNA clamp.","pubmed_id":"35314830","type":"J","associated_entries":"7sh2","doi":"10.1038/s41594-022-00742-6"}]}
