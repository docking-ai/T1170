The 1.6 A crystal structure of Thermotoga maritima RuvB together with five mutant structures reveal that RuvB is an ATPase-associated with diverse cellular activities (AAA+-class ATPase) with a winged-helix DNA-binding domain. The RuvB-ADP complex structure and mutagenesis suggest how AAA+-class ATPases couple nucleotide binding and hydrolysis to interdomain conformational changes and asymmetry within the RuvB hexamer implied by the crystallographic packing and small-angle X-ray scattering in solution. ATP-driven domain motion is positioned to move double-stranded DNA through the hexamer and drive conformational changes between subunits by altering the complementary hydrophilic protein- protein interfaces. Structural and biochemical analysis of five motifs in the protein suggest that ATP binding is a strained conformation recognized both by sensors and the Walker motifs and that intersubunit activation occurs by an arginine finger motif reminiscent of the GTPase-activating proteins. Taken together, these results provide insights into how RuvB functions as a motor for branch migration of Holliday junctions.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Putnam","full_name":"Putnam CD","initials":"CD"},{"last_name":"Clancy","full_name":"Clancy SB","initials":"SB"},{"last_name":"Tsuruta","full_name":"Tsuruta H","initials":"H"},{"last_name":"Gonzalez","full_name":"Gonzalez S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Wetmur","full_name":"Wetmur JG","initials":"JG"},{"last_name":"Tainer","full_name":"Tainer JA","initials":"JA"}],"title":"Structure and mechanism of the RuvB Holliday junction branch migration motor.","pubmed_id":"11478862","type":"J","associated_entries":"1in4, 1in6, 1in7, 1in8, 1j7k","doi":"10.1006/jmbi.2001.4852"}]}
