We identified a stable MLE core comprising the DExH helicase module and two auxiliary domains: a dsRBD and an OB-like fold. MLEcore is an unusual DExH helicase that can unwind blunt-ended RNA duplexes and has specificity for uridine nucleotides. We determined the 2.1\u00a0\u00c5 resolution structure of MLEcore bound to a U10 RNA and ADP-AlF4. The OB-like and dsRBD folds bind the DExH module and contribute to form the entrance of the helicase channel. Four uridine nucleotides engage in base-specific interactions, rationalizing the conservation of uridine-rich sequences in critical roX substrates. roX2 binding is orchestrated by MLE's auxiliary domains, which is prerequisite for MLE localization to the male X chromosome. The structure visualizes a transition-state mimic of the reaction and suggests how eukaryotic DEAH/RHA helicases couple ATP hydrolysis to RNA translocation.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Prabu","full_name":"Prabu JR","initials":"JR"},{"last_name":"M\u00fcller","full_name":"M\u00fcller M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Thomae","full_name":"Thomae AW","initials":"AW"},{"last_name":"Sch\u00fcssler","full_name":"Sch\u00fcssler S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Bonneau","full_name":"Bonneau F","initials":"F"},{"last_name":"Becker","full_name":"Becker PB","initials":"PB"},{"last_name":"Conti","full_name":"Conti E","initials":"E"}],"title":"Structure of the RNA Helicase MLE Reveals the Molecular Mechanisms for Uridine Specificity and RNA-ATP Coupling.","pubmed_id":"26545078","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1016/j.molcel.2015.10.011"}]}
