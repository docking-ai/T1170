Without ATP hydrolysis, ORC-Cdc6 recruits one Cdt1-bound Mcm2-7 hexamer, thus forming an ORC-Cdc6-Cdt1-Mcm2-7 (OCCM) helicase-loading intermediate. Here we report a 3.9-\u00c5 structure of Saccharomyces cerevisiae OCCM on DNA. Flexible Mcm2-7 winged-helix domains (WHDs) engage ORC-Cdc6. A three-domain Cdt1 configuration embraces Mcm2, Mcm4, and Mcm6, thus comprising nearly half of the hexamer. The Cdt1 C-terminal domain extends to the Mcm6 WHD, which binds the Orc4 WHD. DNA passes through the ORC-Cdc6 and Mcm2-7 rings. Origin DNA interaction is mediated by an \u03b1-helix within Orc4 and positively charged loops within Orc2 and Cdc6. The Mcm2-7 C-tier AAA+ ring is topologically closed by an Mcm5 loop that embraces Mcm2, but the N-tier-ring Mcm2-Mcm5 interface remains open. This structure suggests a loading mechanism of the first Cdt1-bound Mcm2-7 hexamer by ORC-Cdc6.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Yuan","full_name":"Yuan Z","initials":"Z"},{"last_name":"Riera","full_name":"Riera A","initials":"A"},{"last_name":"Bai","full_name":"Bai L","initials":"L"},{"last_name":"Sun","full_name":"Sun J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Nandi","full_name":"Nandi S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Spanos","full_name":"Spanos C","initials":"C"},{"last_name":"Chen","full_name":"Chen ZA","initials":"ZA"},{"last_name":"Barbon","full_name":"Barbon M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Rappsilber","full_name":"Rappsilber J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Stillman","full_name":"Stillman B","initials":"B"},{"last_name":"Speck","full_name":"Speck C","initials":"C"},{"last_name":"Li","full_name":"Li H","initials":"H"}],"pubmed_id":"28191893","type":"J"}]}
