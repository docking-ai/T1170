In some teleost species another protein kinase, PKZ, plays a similar role but instead of dsRNA binding domains, PKZ has Z\u03b1 domains. These domains recognize the left-handed conformer of dsDNA and dsRNA known as Z-DNA/Z-RNA. Cyprinid herpesvirus 3 (CyHV-3) infects common and koi carp, that have PKZ, and encodes the ORF112 protein that itself bears a Z\u03b1 domain, a putative competitive inhibitor of PKZ. Here we present the crystal structure of ORF112-Z\u03b1 in complex with an 18 bp CpG DNA repeat, at 1.5 \u00c5. We demonstrate that the bound DNA is in the left-handed conformation and identify key interactions for the specificity of ORF112. Localization of ORF112 protein in stress granules induced in CyHV-3 infected fish cells suggests a functional behaviour similar to that of Z\u03b1 domains of the interferon-regulated, nucleic acid surveillance proteins ADAR1 and DAI.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Ku\u015b","full_name":"Ku\u015b K","initials":"K"},{"last_name":"Rakus","full_name":"Rakus K","initials":"K"},{"last_name":"Boutier","full_name":"Boutier M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Tsigkri","full_name":"Tsigkri T","initials":"T"},{"last_name":"Gabriel","full_name":"Gabriel L","initials":"L"},{"last_name":"Vanderplasschen","full_name":"Vanderplasschen A","initials":"A"},{"last_name":"Athanasiadis","full_name":"Athanasiadis A","initials":"A"}],"title":"The Structure of the Cyprinid Herpesvirus 3 ORF112-Z\u03b1/Z-DNA Complex Reveals a Mechanism of Nucleic Acids Recognition Conserved with E3L, a Poxvirus Inhibitor of Interferon Response.","pubmed_id":"26559969","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1074/jbc.M115.679407"}]}
