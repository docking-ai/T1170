In human cells, the SKI complex functions mainly in co-translational surveillance-decay pathways, and its malfunction is linked to a severe congenital disorder, the trichohepatoenteric syndrome. To obtain insights into the molecular mechanisms regulating the human SKI (hSKI) complex, we structurally characterized several of its functional states in the context of 80S ribosomes and substrate RNA. In a prehydrolytic ATP form, the hSKI complex exhibits a closed conformation with an inherent gating system that effectively traps the 80S-bound RNA into the hSKI2 helicase subunit. When active, hSKI switches to an open conformation in which the gating is released and the RNA 3' end exits the helicase. The emerging picture is that the gatekeeping mechanism and architectural remodeling of hSKI underpin a regulated RNA channeling system that is mechanistically conserved among the cytoplasmic and nuclear helicase-exosome complexes.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"K\u00f6gel","full_name":"K\u00f6gel A","initials":"A"},{"last_name":"Keidel","full_name":"Keidel A","initials":"A"},{"last_name":"Bonneau","full_name":"Bonneau F","initials":"F"},{"last_name":"Sch\u00e4fer","full_name":"Sch\u00e4fer IB","initials":"IB"},{"last_name":"Conti","full_name":"Conti E","initials":"E"}],"title":"The human SKI complex regulates channeling of ribosome-bound RNA to the exosome via an intrinsic gatekeeping mechanism.","pubmed_id":"35120588","type":"J","associated_entries":"7qds, 7qdy, 7qdz, 7qe0","doi":"10.1016/j.molcel.2022.01.009"}]}
