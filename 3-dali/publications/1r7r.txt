Here, we present a 3.6A crystal structure of murine p97 in which D2 domain has been modelled as poly-alanine and the remaining approximately 100 residues are absent. The resulting structure illustrates a head-to-tail packing arrangement of the two p97 AAA domains in a natural hexameric state with D1 ADP bound and D2 nucleotide free. The head-to-tail packing arrangement observed in this structure is in contrast to our previously predicted tail-to-tail packing model. The linker between the D1 and D2 domains is partially disordered, suggesting a flexible nature. Normal mode analysis of the crystal structure suggests anti-correlated motions and distinct conformational states of the two AAA domains.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Huyton","full_name":"Huyton T","initials":"T"},{"last_name":"Pye","full_name":"Pye VE","initials":"VE"},{"last_name":"Briggs","full_name":"Briggs LC","initials":"LC"},{"last_name":"Flynn","full_name":"Flynn TC","initials":"TC"},{"last_name":"Beuron","full_name":"Beuron F","initials":"F"},{"last_name":"Kondo","full_name":"Kondo H","initials":"H"},{"last_name":"Ma","full_name":"Ma J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Zhang","full_name":"Zhang X","initials":"X"},{"last_name":"Freemont","full_name":"Freemont PS","initials":"PS"}],"title":"The crystal structure of murine p97/VCP at 3.6A.","pubmed_id":"14643202","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1016/j.jsb.2003.10.007"}]}
