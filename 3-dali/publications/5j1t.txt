While the function of TorsinA remains elusive, the \u0394E mutation is known to diminish binding of two TorsinA ATPase activators: lamina-associated protein 1 (LAP1) and its paralog, luminal domain like LAP1 (LULL1). Using a nanobody as a crystallization chaperone, we obtained a 1.4 \u00c5 crystal structure of human TorsinA in complex with LULL1. This nanobody likewise stabilized the weakened TorsinA\uf044E-LULL1 interaction, which enabled us to solve its structure at 1.4 \u00c5 also. A comparison of these structures shows, in atomic detail, the subtle differences in activator interactions that separate the healthy from the diseased state. This information may provide a structural platform for drug development, as a small molecule that rescues TorsinA\u0394E could serve as a cure for primary dystonia.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Demircioglu","full_name":"Demircioglu FE","initials":"FE"},{"last_name":"Sosa","full_name":"Sosa BA","initials":"BA"},{"last_name":"Ingram","full_name":"Ingram J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Ploegh","full_name":"Ploegh HL","initials":"HL"},{"last_name":"Schwartz","full_name":"Schwartz TU","initials":"TU"}],"pubmed_id":"27490483","type":"J"}]}
