ClpXP is an important target for drug development against infectious diseases. Although structures are available for isolated ClpX and ClpP rings, it remains unknown how symmetry mismatched ClpX and ClpP work in tandem for processive substrate translocation into the ClpP proteolytic chamber. Here we present cryo-EM structures of the substrate-bound ClpXP complex from <i>Neisseria meningitidis</i> at 2.3 to 3.3 \u00c5 resolution. The structures allow development of a model in which the sequential hydrolysis of ATP is coupled to motions of ClpX loops that lead to directional substrate translocation and ClpX rotation relative to ClpP. Our data add to the growing body of evidence that AAA+ molecular machines generate translocating forces by a common mechanism.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Ripstein","full_name":"Ripstein ZA","initials":"ZA"},{"last_name":"Vahidi","full_name":"Vahidi S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Houry","full_name":"Houry WA","initials":"WA"},{"last_name":"Rubinstein","full_name":"Rubinstein JL","initials":"JL"},{"last_name":"Kay","full_name":"Kay LE","initials":"LE"}],"title":"A processive rotary mechanism couples substrate unfolding and proteolysis in the ClpXP degradation machinery.","pubmed_id":"31916936","type":"J","associated_entries":"6vfx","doi":"10.7554/eLife.52158"}]}
