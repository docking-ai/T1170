In this work, the selectivity and modes of action of a glycoside hydrolase family active on \u03b2-1,3-glucans were systematically investigated combining sequence similarity network, phylogeny, X-ray crystallography, enzyme kinetics, mutagenesis and molecular dynamics. This family exhibits a minimalist and versatile (\u03b1/\u03b2)-barrel scaffold, which can harbor distinguishing exo or endo modes of action, including an ancillary-binding site for the anchoring of triple-helical \u03b2-1,3-glucans. The substrate binding occurs via a hydrophobic knuckle complementary to the canonical curved conformation of \u03b2-1,3-glucans or through a substrate conformational change imposed by the active-site topology of some fungal enzymes. Together, these findings expand our understanding of the enzymatic arsenal of bacteria and fungi for the breakdown and modification of \u03b2-1,3-glucans, which can be exploited for biotechnological applications.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Santos","full_name":"Santos CR","initials":"CR"},{"last_name":"Costa","full_name":"Costa PACR","initials":"PACR"},{"last_name":"Vieira","full_name":"Vieira PS","initials":"PS"},{"last_name":"Gonzalez","full_name":"Gonzalez SET","initials":"SET"},{"last_name":"Correa","full_name":"Correa TLR","initials":"TLR"},{"last_name":"Lima","full_name":"Lima EA","initials":"EA"},{"last_name":"Mandelli","full_name":"Mandelli F","initials":"F"},{"last_name":"Pirolla","full_name":"Pirolla RAS","initials":"RAS"},{"last_name":"Domingues","full_name":"Domingues MN","initials":"MN"},{"last_name":"Cabral","full_name":"Cabral L","initials":"L"},{"last_name":"Martins","full_name":"Martins MP","initials":"MP"},{"last_name":"Cordeiro","full_name":"Cordeiro RL","initials":"RL"},{"last_name":"Junior","full_name":"Junior AT","initials":"AT"},{"last_name":"Souza","full_name":"Souza BP","initials":"BP"},{"last_name":"Prates","full_name":"Prates \u00c9T","initials":"\u00c9T"},{"last_name":"Gozzo","full_name":"Gozzo FC","initials":"FC"},{"last_name":"Persinoti","full_name":"Persinoti GF","initials":"GF"},{"last_name":"Skaf","full_name":"Skaf MS","initials":"MS"},{"last_name":"Murakami","full_name":"Murakami MT","initials":"MT"}],"title":"Structural insights into \u03b2-1,3-glucan cleavage by a glycoside hydrolase family.","pubmed_id":"32451508","type":"J","associated_entries":"6uaq, 6uar, 6uas, 6uat, 6uau, 6uav, 6uaw, 6uax, 6uay, 6uaz, 6ub0, 6ub1, 6ub2, 6ub3, 6ub4, 6ub5, 6ub6, 6ub7, 6uba, 6ubb, 6ubc, 6ubd, 6ufl, 6ufz","doi":"10.1038/s41589-020-0554-5"}]}
