All three copies display very similar asymmetric features to those observed for the bovine enzyme, but the yeast F(1) ATPase structures provide novel information. In particular, the active site that binds ADP in bovine F(1) ATPase has an ATP analog bound and therefore this structure does not represent the ADP-inhibited form. In addition, one of the complexes binds phosphate in the nucleotide-free catalytic site, and comparison with other structures provides a picture of the movement of the phosphate group during initial binding and subsequent catalysis. The shifts in position of the central stalk between two of the three copies of yeast F(1) ATPase and when these structures are compared to those of the bovine enzyme give new insight into the conformational changes that take place during rotational catalysis.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Kabaleeswaran","full_name":"Kabaleeswaran V","initials":"V"},{"last_name":"Puri","full_name":"Puri N","initials":"N"},{"last_name":"Walker","full_name":"Walker JE","initials":"JE"},{"last_name":"Leslie","full_name":"Leslie AG","initials":"AG"},{"last_name":"Mueller","full_name":"Mueller DM","initials":"DM"}],"title":"Novel features of the rotary catalytic mechanism revealed in the structure of yeast F1 ATPase.","pubmed_id":"17082766","type":"J","associated_entries":"1bmf, 1h8e, 1qo1, 1w0j, 1w0k, 2xok","doi":"10.1038/sj.emboj.7601410"},{"journal_info":{"volume":"60","pdb_abbreviation":"Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr","ISO_abbreviation":"Acta Crystallogr.

However, the ordered water molecule that carries out nucleophilic attack on the gamma-phosphate of ATP during hydrolysis is 2.6 angstroms from the beryllium in the beta(DP) subunit and 3.8 angstroms away in the beta(TP) subunit, strongly indicating that the beta(DP) subunit is the catalytically active conformation. In the structure of F1-ATPase with five bound ADP molecules (three in alpha-subunits, one each in the beta(TP) and beta(DP) subunits), which has also been determined, the conformation of alphaArg373 suggests that it senses the presence (or absence) of the gamma-phosphate of ATP.
