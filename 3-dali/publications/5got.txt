The GAS genome encodes one protein tyrosine phosphatase, SP-PTP, which plays an essential role in the replication and virulence maintenance of GAS. Herein, we present the crystal structure of SP-PTP at 1.9\u00a0\u00c5 resolution. Although SP-PTP has been reported to have dual phosphatase specificity for both phosphorylated tyrosine and serine/threonine, three-dimensional structural analysis showed that SP-PTP shares high similarity with typical low molecular weight protein tyrosine phosphatases (LMWPTPs), which are specific for phosphotyrosine, but not with dual-specificity phosphatases, in overall folding and active site composition. In the dephosphorylation activity test, SP-PTP consistently acted on phosphotyrosine substrates, but not or only minimally on phosphoserine/phosphothreonine substrates. Collectively, our structural and biochemical analyses verified SP-PTP as a canonical tyrosine-specific LMWPTP.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Ku","full_name":"Ku B","initials":"B"},{"last_name":"Keum","full_name":"Keum CW","initials":"CW"},{"last_name":"Lee","full_name":"Lee HS","initials":"HS"},{"last_name":"Yun","full_name":"Yun HY","initials":"HY"},{"last_name":"Shin","full_name":"Shin HC","initials":"HC"},{"last_name":"Kim","full_name":"Kim BY","initials":"BY"},{"last_name":"Kim","full_name":"Kim SJ","initials":"SJ"}],"pubmed_id":"27545603","type":"J"}]}
