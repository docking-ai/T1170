In all eukaryotes, the six-subunit origin recognition complex (Orc1-6; ORC) recognizes the replication origin. During late M-phase of the cell-cycle, Cdc6 binds to ORC and the ORC-Cdc6 complex loads in a multistep reaction and, with the help of Cdt1, the core Mcm2-7 helicase onto DNA. A key intermediate is the ORC-Cdc6-Cdt1-Mcm2-7 (OCCM) complex in which DNA has been already inserted into the central channel of Mcm2-7. Until now, it has been unclear how the origin DNA is guided by ORC-Cdc6 and inserted into the Mcm2-7 hexamer. Here, we truncated the C-terminal winged-helix-domain (WHD) of Mcm6 to slow down the loading reaction, thereby capturing two loading intermediates prior to DNA insertion in budding yeast. In \"semi-attached OCCM,\" the Mcm3 and Mcm7 WHDs latch onto ORC-Cdc6 while the main body of the Mcm2-7 hexamer is not connected. In \"pre-insertion OCCM,\" the main body of Mcm2-7 docks onto ORC-Cdc6, and the origin DNA is bent and positioned adjacent to the open DNA entry gate, poised for insertion, at the Mcm2-Mcm5 interface. We used molecular simulations to reveal the dynamic transition from preloading conformers to the loaded conformers in which the loading of Mcm2-7 on DNA is complete and the DNA entry gate is fully closed. Our work provides multiple molecular insights into a key event of eukaryotic DNA replication.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Yuan","full_name":"Yuan Z","initials":"Z"},{"last_name":"Schneider","full_name":"Schneider S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Dodd","full_name":"Dodd T","initials":"T"},{"last_name":"Riera","full_name":"Riera A","initials":"A"},{"last_name":"Bai","full_name":"Bai L","initials":"L"},{"last_name":"Yan","full_name":"Yan C","initials":"C"},{"last_name":"Magdalou","full_name":"Magdalou I","initials":"I"},{"last_name":"Ivanov","full_name":"Ivanov I","initials":"I"},{"last_name":"Stillman","full_name":"Stillman B","initials":"B"},{"last_name":"Li","full_name":"Li H","initials":"H"},{"last_name":"Speck","full_name":"Speck C","initials":"C"}],"title":"Structural mechanism of helicase loading onto replication origin DNA by ORC-Cdc6.","pubmed_id":"32669428","type":"J","associated_entries":"6wgf, 6wgg, 6wgi","doi":"10.1073/pnas.2006231117"}]}
