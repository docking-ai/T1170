Rif1 and Rif2, along with Rap1, form the telosome, a protective cap that inhibits telomerase, counteracts SIR-mediated transcriptional silencing, and prevents inadvertent recognition of telomeres as DNA double-strand breaks. We provide a molecular, biochemical, and functional dissection of the protein backbone at the core of the yeast telosome. The X-ray structures of Rif1 and Rif2 bound to the Rap1 C-terminal domain and that of the Rif1 C terminus are presented. Both Rif1 and Rif2 have separable and independent Rap1-binding epitopes, allowing Rap1 binding over large distances (42-110\u00a0\u00c5). We identify tetramerization (Rif1) and polymerization (Rif2) modules that, in conjunction with the long-range binding, give rise to a higher-order architecture that interlinks Rap1 units. This molecular Velcro relies on Rif1 and Rif2 to recruit and stabilize Rap1 on telomeric arrays and is required for telomere homeostasis in\u00a0vivo.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Shi","full_name":"Shi T","initials":"T"},{"last_name":"Bunker","full_name":"Bunker RD","initials":"RD"},{"last_name":"Mattarocci","full_name":"Mattarocci S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Ribeyre","full_name":"Ribeyre C","initials":"C"},{"last_name":"Faty","full_name":"Faty M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Gut","full_name":"Gut H","initials":"H"},{"last_name":"Scrima","full_name":"Scrima A","initials":"A"},{"last_name":"Rass","full_name":"Rass U","initials":"U"},{"last_name":"Rubin","full_name":"Rubin SM","initials":"SM"},{"last_name":"Shore","full_name":"Shore D","initials":"D"},{"last_name":"Thom\u00e4","full_name":"Thom\u00e4 NH","initials":"NH"}],"title":"Rif1 and Rif2 Shape Telomere Function and Architecture through Multivalent Rap1 Interactions.","pubmed_id":"23746845","type":"J","associated_entries":"4bj5, 4bj6, 4bjs, 4bjt","doi":"10.1016/j.cell.2013.05.007"}]}
