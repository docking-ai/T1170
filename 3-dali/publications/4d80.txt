Here we present a 3.6-\u00c5 X-ray structure of ring-shaped Vps4 from Metallosphera sedula (MsVps4), seen as an asymmetric pseudohexamer. Conserved key interface residues are shown to be important for MsVps4 assembly, ATPase activity in vitro, ESCRT-III disassembly in vitro and HIV-1 budding. ADP binding leads to conformational changes within the protomer, which might propagate within the ring structure. All ATP-binding sites are accessible and the pseudohexamer binds six ATP with micromolar affinity in vitro. In contrast, ADP occupies one high-affinity and five low-affinity binding sites in vitro, consistent with conformational asymmetry induced on ATP hydrolysis. The structure represents a snapshot of an assembled Vps4 conformation and provides insight into the molecular motions the ring structure undergoes in a concerted action to couple ATP hydrolysis to ESCRT-III substrate disassembly.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Caillat","full_name":"Caillat C","initials":"C"},{"last_name":"Macheboeuf","full_name":"Macheboeuf P","initials":"P"},{"last_name":"Wu","full_name":"Wu Y","initials":"Y"},{"last_name":"McCarthy","full_name":"McCarthy AA","initials":"AA"},{"last_name":"Boeri-Erba","full_name":"Boeri-Erba E","initials":"E"},{"last_name":"Effantin","full_name":"Effantin G","initials":"G"},{"last_name":"G\u00f6ttlinger","full_name":"G\u00f6ttlinger HG","initials":"HG"},{"last_name":"Weissenhorn","full_name":"Weissenhorn W","initials":"W"},{"last_name":"Renesto","full_name":"Renesto P","initials":"P"}],"title":"Asymmetric ring structure of Vps4 required for ESCRT-III disassembly.","pubmed_id":"26632262","type":"J","associated_entries":"4d81, 4d82","doi":"10.1038/ncomms9781"}]}
