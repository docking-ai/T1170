In this mechanism, unfolded polypeptides are threaded through the aligned pores of the ATPase and peptidase and translocated into the peptidase central chamber.","results":"We present a 3.0 A resolution crystal structure of HslVU with an HslU hexamer bound at one end of an HslV dodecamer. The structure shows that the central pores of the ATPase and peptidase are next to each other and aligned. The central pore of HslU consists of a GYVG motif, which is conserved among protease-associated ATPases. The binding of one HslU hexamer to one end of an HslV dodecamer in the 3.0 A resolution structure opens both HslV central pores and induces asymmetric changes in HslV.","unassigned":null,"background":"The bacterial heat shock locus HslU ATPase and HslV peptidase together form an ATP-dependent HslVU protease.

We have recently shown that HslV and HslU can function together as a novel ATP-dependent protease, the HslVU protease. We have now purified both proteins to apparent homogeneity from extracts of E. coli carrying the hslVU operon on a multicopy plasmid. HslU by itself cleaved ATP, and pure HslV is a weak peptidase degrading certain hydrophobic peptides. HslU dramatically stimulated peptide hydrolysis by HslV when ATP is present. With a 1:4 molar ratio of HslV to HslU, approximately a 200-fold increase in peptide hydrolysis was observed. HslV stimulated the ATPase activity of HslU 2-4-fold, but had little influence on the affinity of HslU to ATP. The nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, beta,gamma-methylene-ATP, did not support peptide hydrolysis. Other nucleotides (CTP, dATP) that were slowly hydrolyzed by HslU allowed some peptide hydrolysis. Therefore, ATP cleavage appears essential for the HslV activity. Upon gel filtration on a Sephacryl S-300 column, HslV behaved as a 250-kDa oligomer (i.e. 12-14 subunits), and HslU behaved as a 100-kDa protein (i.e. a dimer) in the absence of ATP, but as a 450-kDa multimer (8-10 subunits) in its presence. Therefore ATP appears necessary for oligomerization of HslU. Thus the HslVU protease appears to be a two-component protease in which HslV harbors the peptidase activity, while HslU provides an essential ATPase activity.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Yoo","full_name":"Yoo SJ","initials":"SJ"},{"last_name":"Seol","full_name":"Seol JH","initials":"JH"},{"last_name":"Shin","full_name":"Shin DH","initials":"DH"},{"last_name":"Rohrwild","full_name":"Rohrwild M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Kang","full_name":"Kang MS","initials":"MS"},{"last_name":"Tanaka","full_name":"Tanaka K","initials":"K"},{"last_name":"Goldberg","full_name":"Goldberg AL","initials":"AL"},{"last_name":"Chung","full_name":"Chung CH","initials":"CH"}],"pubmed_id":"8662828","type":"J"},{"journal_info":{"volume":"403","pdb_abbreviation":"Nature","ISO_abbreviation":null,"year":2000,"issue":null,"pages":"800-805"},"doi":"10.1038/35001629","associated_entries":"1g4a","title":"The Structuers of HslU and the ATP-Dependent Protease HslU-HslV.","abstract":{"methods":null,"conclusions":null,"results":null,"unassigned":null,"background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":null,"full_name":"Bochtler, M.","initials":null},{"last_name":null,"full_name":"Hartmann, C.","initials":null},{"last_name":null,"full_name":"Song, H.K.","initials":null},{"last_name":null,"full_name":"Bourenkov, G.P.","initials":null},{"last_name":null,"full_name":"Bartunik, H.D.","initials":null},{"last_name":null,"full_name":"Huber, R.","initials":null}],"pubmed_id":null,"type":"J"}]}
