Each NSF protomer contains three domains: an N-terminal domain required for SNARE binding and two ATPase domains, termed D1 and D2, with D2 being required for oligomerization. We have determined the 1.9 A crystal structure of the D2 domain of NSF complexed with ATP using multi-wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing. D2 consists of a nucleotide binding subdomain with a Rossmann fold and a C-terminal subdomain, which is structurally unique among nucleotide binding proteins. There are interactions between the ATP moiety and both the neighboring D2 protomer and the C-terminal subdomain that may be important for ATP-dependent oligomerization. Of particular importance are three well-ordered and conserved lysine residues that form ionic interactions with the beta- and gamma-phosphates, one of which likely contributes to the low hydrolytic activity of D2.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Yu","full_name":"Yu RC","initials":"RC"},{"last_name":"Hanson","full_name":"Hanson PI","initials":"PI"},{"last_name":"Jahn","full_name":"Jahn R","initials":"R"},{"last_name":"Br\u00fcnger","full_name":"Br\u00fcnger AT","initials":"AT"}],"pubmed_id":"9731775","type":"J"},{"journal_info":{"volume":"268","pdb_abbreviation":"J Biol Chem","ISO_abbreviation":"J.
