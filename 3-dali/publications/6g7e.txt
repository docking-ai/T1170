The single\u2011subunit remodeler Mot1 dissociates TATA box-binding protein (TBP):DNA complexes and provides a simple model for obtaining structural insights into the action of Swi2/Snf2 ATPases. Previously we reported how the N-terminal domain of Mot1 it binds TBP, NC2 and DNA, but the location of the C-terminal ATPase domain remained unclear (Butryn et al., 2015). Here, we report the crystal structure of the near full-length Mot1 from <i>Chaetomium thermophilum.</i> Our data show that Mot1 adopts a ring like structure with a catalytically inactive resting state of the ATPase. Biochemical analysis suggests that TBP binding switches Mot1 into an ATP hydrolysis-competent conformation. Combined with our previous results, these data significantly improve the structural model for the complete Mot1:TBP:DNA complex and suggest a general mechanism for Mot1 action.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Butryn","full_name":"Butryn A","initials":"A"},{"last_name":"Woike","full_name":"Woike S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Shetty","full_name":"Shetty SJ","initials":"SJ"},{"last_name":"Auble","full_name":"Auble DT","initials":"DT"},{"last_name":"Hopfner","full_name":"Hopfner KP","initials":"KP"}],"title":"Crystal structure of the full Swi2/Snf2 remodeler Mot1 in the resting state.","pubmed_id":"30289385","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.7554/eLife.37774"}]}
