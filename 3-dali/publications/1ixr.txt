Two RuvA tetramers form the symmetric and closed octameric shell, where four RuvA domain IIIs spring out in the two opposite directions to be individually caught by a single RuvB. The binding of domain III deforms the protruding beta hairpin in the N-terminal domain of RuvB and thereby appears to induce a functional and less symmetric RuvB hexameric ring. The model of the RuvA-RuvB junction DNA ternary complex, constructed by fitting the X-ray structure into the averaged electron microscopic images of the RuvA-RuvB junction, appears to be more compatible with the branch migration mode of a fixed RuvA-RuvB interaction than with a rotational interaction mode.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Yamada","full_name":"Yamada K","initials":"K"},{"last_name":"Miyata","full_name":"Miyata T","initials":"T"},{"last_name":"Tsuchiya","full_name":"Tsuchiya D","initials":"D"},{"last_name":"Oyama","full_name":"Oyama T","initials":"T"},{"last_name":"Fujiwara","full_name":"Fujiwara Y","initials":"Y"},{"last_name":"Ohnishi","full_name":"Ohnishi T","initials":"T"},{"last_name":"Iwasaki","full_name":"Iwasaki H","initials":"H"},{"last_name":"Shinagawa","full_name":"Shinagawa H","initials":"H"},{"last_name":"Ariyoshi","full_name":"Ariyoshi M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Mayanagi","full_name":"Mayanagi K","initials":"K"},{"last_name":"Morikawa","full_name":"Morikawa K","initials":"K"}],"pubmed_id":"12408833","type":"J"}]}
