Here we illustrate an atomic level mechanism for this activity with a crystal structure of an archaeal MCM hexamer bound to single-stranded DNA and nucleotide cofactors. Sequence conservation indicates this rotary mechanism is fully possible for all eukaryotes and archaea. The structure definitively demonstrates the ring orients during translocation with the N-terminal domain leading, indicating that the translocation activity could also provide the physical basis of replication initiation where a double-hexamer idly encircling double-stranded DNA transforms to single-hexamers that encircle only one strand. In this mechanism, each strand binds to the N-terminal tier of one hexamer and the AAA+ tier of the other hexamer such that one ring pulls on the other, aligning equivalent interfaces to enable each hexamer to pull its translocation strand outside of the opposing hexamer.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Meagher","full_name":"Meagher M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Epling","full_name":"Epling LB","initials":"LB"},{"last_name":"Enemark","full_name":"Enemark EJ","initials":"EJ"}],"pubmed_id":"31308367","type":"J"}]}
