Each PCAT contains two peptidase domains that cleave off the secretion signal, two transmembrane domains forming a translocation pathway, and two nucleotide-binding domains that hydrolyze ATP. Previously the crystal structures of a PCAT from <i>Clostridium thermocellum</i> (PCAT1) were determined in the absence and presence of ATP, revealing how ATP binding regulates the protease activity and access to the translocation pathway. However, how the substrate CtA, a 90-residue polypeptide, is recognized by PCAT1 remained elusive. To address this question, we determined the structure of the PCAT1-CtA complex by electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) to 3.4 \u00c5 resolution. The structure shows that two CtAs are bound via their N-terminal leader peptides, but only one is positioned for cleavage and translocation. Based on these results, we propose a model of how substrate cleavage, ATP hydrolysis, and substrate translocation are coordinated in a transport cycle.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Kieuvongngam","full_name":"Kieuvongngam V","initials":"V"},{"last_name":"Olinares","full_name":"Olinares PDB","initials":"PDB"},{"last_name":"Palillo","full_name":"Palillo A","initials":"A"},{"last_name":"Oldham","full_name":"Oldham ML","initials":"ML"},{"last_name":"Chait","full_name":"Chait BT","initials":"BT"},{"last_name":"Chen","full_name":"Chen J","initials":"J"}],"title":"Structural basis of substrate recognition by a polypeptide processing and secretion transporter.","pubmed_id":"31934861","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.7554/eLife.51492"}]}
