Herein, we found that the basal ATPase activity of spastin is negatively regulated by spastin concentration. By determining a spastin crystal structure, we demonstrate the necessity of intersubunit interactions between spastin AAA domains. Neutralization of the positive charges in the microtubule-binding domain (MTBD) of spastin dramatically decreases the ATPase activity at low concentration, although the ATP-hydrolyzing potential is not affected. These results demonstrate that, in addition to the AAA domain, the MTBD region of spastin is also involved in regulating ATPase activity, making interactions between spastin protomers more complicated than expected.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Fan","full_name":"Fan X","initials":"X"},{"last_name":"Lin","full_name":"Lin Z","initials":"Z"},{"last_name":"Fan","full_name":"Fan G","initials":"G"},{"last_name":"Lu","full_name":"Lu J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Hou","full_name":"Hou Y","initials":"Y"},{"last_name":"Habai","full_name":"Habai G","initials":"G"},{"last_name":"Sun","full_name":"Sun L","initials":"L"},{"last_name":"Yu","full_name":"Yu P","initials":"P"},{"last_name":"Shen","full_name":"Shen Y","initials":"Y"},{"last_name":"Wen","full_name":"Wen M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Wang","full_name":"Wang C","initials":"C"}],"title":"The AAA protein spastin possesses two levels of basal ATPase activity.","pubmed_id":"29710391","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1002/1873-3468.13075"}]}
