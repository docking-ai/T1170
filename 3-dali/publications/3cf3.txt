We determined the crystal structure of D2 at 3.0 A resolution. This model enabled rerefinement of full-length p97 in different nucleotide states against previously reported low-resolution diffraction data to significantly improved R values and Ramachandran statistics. Although the overall fold remained similar, there are significant improvements, especially around the D2 nucleotide binding site. The rerefinement illustrates the importance of knowledge of high-resolution structures of fragments covering most of the whole molecule. The structures suggest that nucleotide hydrolysis is transformed into larger conformational changes by pushing of one D2 domain by its neighbor in the hexamer, and transmission of nucleotide-state information through the D1-D2 linker to displace the N-terminal, effector binding domain.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Davies","full_name":"Davies JM","initials":"JM"},{"last_name":"Brunger","full_name":"Brunger AT","initials":"AT"},{"last_name":"Weis","full_name":"Weis WI","initials":"WI"}],"title":"Improved structures of full-length p97, an AAA ATPase: implications for mechanisms of nucleotide-dependent conformational change.","pubmed_id":"18462676","type":"J","associated_entries":"3cf0, 3cf1, 3cf2","doi":"10.1016/j.str.2008.02.010"},{"journal_info":{"volume":"10","pdb_abbreviation":"Nat.

These events include the alteration of both nuclear and mitotic Golgi membranes, the dislocation of ubiquitylated proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum and regulation of the NF-kappa b pathway. Here we present the crystal structure of full-length Mus musculus p97/VCP in complex with a mixture of ADP and ADP-AlF(x) at a resolution of 4.7 A. This is the first complete hexameric structure of a protein containing tandem AAA (ATPases associated with a variety of cellular activities) domains. Comparison of the crystal structure and cryo-electron microscopy (EM) reconstructions reveals large conformational changes in the helical subdomains during the hydrolysis cycle. Structural and functional data imply a communication mechanism between the AAA domains.

One of the members of this family, the hexameric p97/valosin-containing protein p97/VCP, is essential for the dislocation of misfolded membrane proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum. Here, we observe large motions and dynamic changes of p97/VCP as it proceeds through the ATP hydrolysis cycle. The analysis is based on crystal structures of four representative ATP hydrolysis states: APO, AMP-PNP, hydrolysis transition state ADP x AlF3, and ADP bound. Two of the structures presented herein, ADP and AMP-PNP bound, are new structures, and the ADP x AlF3 structure was re-refined to higher resolution. The largest motions occur at two stages during the hydrolysis cycle: after, but not upon, nucleotide binding and then following nucleotide release. The motions occur primarily in the D2 domain, the D1 alpha-helical domain, and the N-terminal domain, relative to the relatively stationary and invariant D1alpha/beta domain. In addition to the motions, we observed a transition from a rigid state to a flexible state upon loss of the gamma-phosphate group, and a further increase in flexibility within the D2 domains upon nucleotide release. The domains within each protomer of the hexameric p97/VCP deviate from strict 6-fold symmetry, with the more flexible ADP state exhibiting greater asymmetry compared to the relatively rigid ADP x AlF3 state, suggesting a mechanism of action in which hydrolysis and conformational changes move about the hexamer in a processive fashion.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"DeLaBarre","full_name":"DeLaBarre B","initials":"B"},{"last_name":"Brunger","full_name":"Brunger AT","initials":"AT"}],"title":"Nucleotide dependent motion and mechanism of action of p97/VCP.","pubmed_id":"15740751","type":"J","associated_entries":"3cf0, 3cf1, 3cf2","doi":"10.1016/j.jmb.2005.01.060"}]}
