A hallmark feature shared by AAA+ proteases is the stimulation of ATPase activity by substrates. Here we report the structure of LonA bound to three ADPs, revealing the first AAA+ protease assembly where the six protomers are arranged alternately in nucleotide-free and bound states. Nucleotide binding induces large coordinated movements of conserved pore loops from two pairs of three non-adjacent protomers and shuttling of the proteolytic groove between the ATPase site and a previously unknown Arg paddle. Structural and biochemical evidence supports the roles of the substrate-bound proteolytic groove in allosteric stimulation of ATPase activity and the conserved Arg paddle in driving substrate degradation. Altogether, this work provides a molecular framework for understanding how ATP-dependent chemomechanical movements drive allosteric processes for substrate degradation in a major protein-destruction machine.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Lin","full_name":"Lin CC","initials":"CC"},{"last_name":"Su","full_name":"Su SC","initials":"SC"},{"last_name":"Su","full_name":"Su MY","initials":"MY"},{"last_name":"Liang","full_name":"Liang PH","initials":"PH"},{"last_name":"Feng","full_name":"Feng CC","initials":"CC"},{"last_name":"Wu","full_name":"Wu SH","initials":"SH"},{"last_name":"Chang","full_name":"Chang CI","initials":"CI"}],"pubmed_id":"27041592","type":"J"}]}
