We present the first atomic structure of the nucleotide-free yeast His(6)DeltaNVps4p dimer and its AMPPNP (5'-adenylyl-beta,gamma-imidodiphosphate)-bound tetradecamer, derived from a cryo electron microscopy map. Vps4p dimers form two distinct heptameric rings and accommodate AAA cassettes in a head-to-head--not in a head-to-tail-fashion as in class II AAA-ATPases. Our model suggests a mechanism for disassembling ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport) complexes by movements of substrate-binding domains located at the periphery of the tetradecamer during ATP hydrolysis in one ring, followed by translocation through the central pore and ATP hydrolysis in the second ring.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Hartmann","full_name":"Hartmann C","initials":"C"},{"last_name":"Chami","full_name":"Chami M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Zachariae","full_name":"Zachariae U","initials":"U"},{"last_name":"de Groot","full_name":"de Groot BL","initials":"BL"},{"last_name":"Engel","full_name":"Engel A","initials":"A"},{"last_name":"Gr\u00fctter","full_name":"Gr\u00fctter MG","initials":"MG"}],"title":"Vacuolar protein sorting: two different functional states of the AAA-ATPase Vps4p.","pubmed_id":"18272179","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1016/j.jmb.2008.01.010"}]}
