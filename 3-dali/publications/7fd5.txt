Lon contains a large N-terminal domain and forms a hexameric core of fused adenosine triphosphatase and protease domains. Here, we report two complete structures of Lon engaging a substrate, determined by cryo\u2013electron microscopy to 2.4-angstrom resolution. These structures show a multilayered architecture featuring a tensegrity triangle complex, uniquely constructed by six long N-terminal helices. The interlocked helix triangle is assembled on the top of the hexameric core to spread a web of six globular substrate-binding domains. It serves as a multipurpose platform that controls the access of substrates to the AAA+ ring, provides a ruler-based mechanism for substrate selection, and acts as a pulley device to facilitate unfolding of the translocated substrate. This work provides a complete framework for understanding the structural mechanisms of Lon.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Li","full_name":"Li S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Hsieh","full_name":"Hsieh KY","initials":"KY"},{"last_name":"Kuo","full_name":"Kuo CI","initials":"CI"},{"last_name":"Lee","full_name":"Lee SH","initials":"SH"},{"last_name":"Pintilie","full_name":"Pintilie GD","initials":"GD"},{"last_name":"Zhang","full_name":"Zhang K","initials":"K"},{"last_name":"Chang","full_name":"Chang CI","initials":"CI"}],"title":"Complete three-dimensional structures of the Lon protease translocating a protein substrate.","pubmed_id":"34652947","type":"J","associated_entries":"7fd4","doi":"10.1126/sciadv.abj7835"}]}
