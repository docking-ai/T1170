Here we report the crystal structure of the anti-CRISPR protein AcrF3 in complex with Pseudomonas aeruginosa Cas3 (PaCas3). AcrF3 forms a homodimer that locks PaCas3 in an ADP-bound form, blocks the entrance of the DNA-binding tunnel in the helicase domain, and masks the linker region and C-terminal domain of PaCas3, thereby preventing recruitment by Cascade and inhibiting the type I-F CRISPR-Cas system.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Wang","full_name":"Wang X","initials":"X"},{"last_name":"Yao","full_name":"Yao D","initials":"D"},{"last_name":"Xu","full_name":"Xu JG","initials":"JG"},{"last_name":"Li","full_name":"Li AR","initials":"AR"},{"last_name":"Xu","full_name":"Xu J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Fu","full_name":"Fu P","initials":"P"},{"last_name":"Zhou","full_name":"Zhou Y","initials":"Y"},{"last_name":"Zhu","full_name":"Zhu Y","initials":"Y"}],"title":"Structural basis of Cas3 inhibition by the bacteriophage protein AcrF3.","pubmed_id":"27455460","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1038/nsmb.3269"}]}
