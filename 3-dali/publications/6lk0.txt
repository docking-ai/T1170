Here we present the crystal structure of wild-type human TRIP13 at a resolution of 2.6 \u00c5. A small molecule inhibitor targeting TRIP13 was identified based on the crystal structure. The inhibitor, designated DCZ0415, was confirmed to bind TRIP13 using pull-down, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and surface plasmon resonance binding assays. DCZ0415 induced anti-myeloma activity in vitro, in vivo, and in primary cells derived from drug-resistant myeloma patients. The inhibitor impaired nonhomologous end joining repair and inhibited NF-\u03baB activity. Moreover, combining DCZ0415 with the MM chemotherapeutic melphalan or the HDAC inhibitor panobinostat induced synergistic anti-myeloma activity. Therefore, targeting TRIP13 may be an effective therapeutic strategy for MM, particularly refractory or relapsed MM.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Wang","full_name":"Wang Y","initials":"Y"},{"last_name":"Huang","full_name":"Huang J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Li","full_name":"Li B","initials":"B"},{"last_name":"Xue","full_name":"Xue H","initials":"H"},{"last_name":"Tricot","full_name":"Tricot G","initials":"G"},{"last_name":"Hu","full_name":"Hu L","initials":"L"},{"last_name":"Xu","full_name":"Xu Z","initials":"Z"},{"last_name":"Sun","full_name":"Sun X","initials":"X"},{"last_name":"Chang","full_name":"Chang S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Gao","full_name":"Gao L","initials":"L"},{"last_name":"Tao","full_name":"Tao Y","initials":"Y"},{"last_name":"Xu","full_name":"Xu H","initials":"H"},{"last_name":"Xie","full_name":"Xie Y","initials":"Y"},{"last_name":"Xiao","full_name":"Xiao W","initials":"W"},{"last_name":"Yu","full_name":"Yu D","initials":"D"},{"last_name":"Kong","full_name":"Kong Y","initials":"Y"},{"last_name":"Chen","full_name":"Chen G","initials":"G"},{"last_name":"Sun","full_name":"Sun X","initials":"X"},{"last_name":"Lian","full_name":"Lian F","initials":"F"},{"last_name":"Zhang","full_name":"Zhang N","initials":"N"},{"last_name":"Wu","full_name":"Wu X","initials":"X"},{"last_name":"Mao","full_name":"Mao Z","initials":"Z"},{"last_name":"Zhan","full_name":"Zhan F","initials":"F"},{"last_name":"Zhu","full_name":"Zhu W","initials":"W"},{"last_name":"Shi","full_name":"Shi J","initials":"J"}],"title":"A Small Molecule Inhibitor Targeting TRIP13 suppresses multiple myeloma progression.","pubmed_id":"31732653","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-18-3987"}]}
