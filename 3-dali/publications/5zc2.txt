The two components of Acinetobacter baumannii HPAH are known as C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>, respectively. C<sub>1</sub> is a flavin reductase that uses NADH to generate reduced flavin mononucleotide (FMNH<sub>-</sub>), which is used by C<sub>2</sub> in the hydroxylation of HPA. Interestingly, although HPA is not directly involved in the reaction catalyzed by C<sub>1</sub>, the presence of HPA dramatically increases the FMN reduction rate. Amino acid sequence analysis revealed that C<sub>1</sub> contains two domains: an N-terminal flavin reductase domain, and a C-terminal MarR domain. Although MarR proteins typically function as transcription regulators, the MarR domain of C<sub>1</sub> was found to play an auto-inhibitory role. Here, we report a crystal structure of C<sub>1</sub> and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) studies that revealed that C<sub>1</sub> undergoes a substantial conformational change in the presence of HPA, concomitant with the increase in the rate of flavin reduction. Amino acid residues that are important for HPA binding and regulation of C<sub>1</sub> activity were identified by site-directed mutagenesis. Amino acid sequence similarity analysis revealed several as yet uncharacterized flavin reductases with N- or C-terminal fusions.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Yuenyao","full_name":"Yuenyao A","initials":"A"},{"last_name":"Petchyam","full_name":"Petchyam N","initials":"N"},{"last_name":"Kamonsutthipaijit","full_name":"Kamonsutthipaijit N","initials":"N"},{"last_name":"Chaiyen","full_name":"Chaiyen P","initials":"P"},{"last_name":"Pakotiprapha","full_name":"Pakotiprapha D","initials":"D"}],"title":"Crystal structure of the flavin reductase of Acinetobacter baumannii p-hydroxyphenylacetate 3-hydroxylase (HPAH) and identification of amino acid residues underlying its regulation by aromatic ligands.","pubmed_id":"29940152","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1016/j.abb.2018.06.010"}]}
