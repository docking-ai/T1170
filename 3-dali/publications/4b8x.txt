Putative orthologs are encoded by the majority of sequenced actinomycete genomes, and may play roles in regulating growth and antibiotic production, but they have yet to be assigned a precise function. Sco5413 forms a homodimer and, through comparisons with other MarR family protein structures, we postulate that it adopts a conformation compatible with DNA binding, and that a channel at the dimer interface, lined by well-conserved residues, is the binding site of an unidentified effector ligand.
