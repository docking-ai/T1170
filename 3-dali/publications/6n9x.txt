Using bacteriophage T7 as a model system, we determined cryo-electron microscopy structures up to 3.2-angstroms resolution of helicase translocating along DNA and of helicase-polymerase-primase complexes engaging in synthesis of both DNA strands. Each domain of the spiral-shaped hexameric helicase translocates sequentially hand-over-hand along a single-stranded DNA coil, akin to the way AAA+ ATPases (adenosine triphosphatases) unfold peptides. Two lagging-strand polymerases are attached to the primase, ready for Okazaki fragment synthesis in tandem. A \u03b2 hairpin from the leading-strand polymerase separates two parental DNA strands into a T-shaped fork, thus enabling the closely coupled helicase to advance perpendicular to the downstream DNA duplex. These structures reveal the molecular organization and operating principles of a replisome.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Gao","full_name":"Gao Y","initials":"Y"},{"last_name":"Cui","full_name":"Cui Y","initials":"Y"},{"last_name":"Fox","full_name":"Fox T","initials":"T"},{"last_name":"Lin","full_name":"Lin S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Wang","full_name":"Wang H","initials":"H"},{"last_name":"de Val","full_name":"de Val N","initials":"N"},{"last_name":"Zhou","full_name":"Zhou ZH","initials":"ZH"},{"last_name":"Yang","full_name":"Yang W","initials":"W"}],"title":"Structures and operating principles of the replisome.","pubmed_id":"30679383","type":"J","associated_entries":"6n7i, 6n7n, 6n7s, 6n7t, 6n7v, 6n7w, 6n9u, 6n9v, 6n9w","doi":"10.1126/science.aav7003"}]}
