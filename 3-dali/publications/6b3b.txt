Here we discover an unusual mononuclear iron-dependent methyltransferase that acts in the initiation steps of apratoxin A biosynthesis (AprA MT1). Iron-replete AprA MT1 catalyzes one or two methyl transfer reactions on the substrate malonyl-ACP (acyl carrier protein), whereas Co, Mn and Ni support only a single methyl transfer. MT1 homologs exist within the \"GNAT\" (GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase) loading modules of several modular biosynthetic pathways with propionyl, isobutyryl or pivaloyl starter units. GNAT domains are thought to catalyze decarboxylation of malonyl-CoA and acetyl transfer to a carrier protein. In AprA the GNAT domain lacks both decarboxylation and acyl transfer activity, and the MT1 acts on the malonyl \u03b1-carbon, which is more reactive than the acetyl methyl. A crystal structure of the AprA MT1-GNAT didomain with bound Mn2+, malonate and the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) reveals that the malonyl substrate is a bidentate metal ligand, indicating that the metal acts as a Lewis acid to promote methylation of the malonyl \u03b1-carbon. The GNAT domain is truncated relative to functional homologs. These results afford an expanded understanding of MT1-GNAT structure and activity, and permit the functional annotation of homologous GNAT loading modules both with and without methyltransferases, additionally revealing their rapid evolutionary adaptation in different biosynthetic contexts.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Skiba","full_name":"Skiba MA","initials":"MA"},{"last_name":"Sikkema","full_name":"Sikkema AP","initials":"AP"},{"last_name":"Moss","full_name":"Moss NA","initials":"NA"},{"last_name":"Tran","full_name":"Tran CL","initials":"CL"},{"last_name":"Sturgis","full_name":"Sturgis RM","initials":"RM"},{"last_name":"Gerwick","full_name":"Gerwick L","initials":"L"},{"last_name":"Gerwick","full_name":"Gerwick WH","initials":"WH"},{"last_name":"Sherman","full_name":"Sherman DH","initials":"DH"},{"last_name":"Smith","full_name":"Smith JL","initials":"JL"}],"title":"A Mononuclear Iron-Dependent Methyltransferase Catalyzes Initial Steps in Assembly of the Apratoxin A Polyketide Starter Unit.","pubmed_id":"29096064","type":"J","associated_entries":"6b39, 6b3a","doi":"10.1021/acschembio.7b00746"}]}
