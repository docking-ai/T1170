ISOLDE combines interactive molecular-dynamics flexible fitting with modern molecular-graphics visualization and established structural biology libraries to provide an immersive interface wherein the model constantly acts to maintain physically realistic conformations as the user interacts with it by directly tugging atoms with a mouse or haptic interface or applying/removing restraints. In addition, common validation tasks are accelerated and visualized in real time. Using the recently described 3.8\u2005\u00c5 resolution cryo-EM structure of the eukaryotic minichromosome maintenance (MCM) helicase complex as a case study, it is demonstrated how ISOLDE can be used alongside other modern refinement tools to avoid common pitfalls of low-resolution modelling and improve the quality of the final model. A detailed analysis of changes between the initial and final model provides a somewhat sobering insight into the dangers of relying on a small number of validation metrics to judge the quality of a low-resolution model.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Croll","full_name":"Croll TI","initials":"TI"}],"title":"ISOLDE: a physically realistic environment for model building into low-resolution electron-density maps.","pubmed_id":"29872003","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1107/S2059798318002425"},{"journal_info":{"volume":"4","pdb_abbreviation":"Comput.

However, significant time and effort are still required to solve and complete many of these structures because of the need for manual interpretation of complex numerical data using many software packages and the repeated use of interactive three-dimensional graphics. PHENIX has been developed to provide a comprehensive system for macromolecular crystallographic structure solution with an emphasis on the automation of all procedures. This has relied on the development of algorithms that minimize or eliminate subjective input, the development of algorithms that automate procedures that are traditionally performed by hand and, finally, the development of a framework that allows a tight integration between the algorithms.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Adams","full_name":"Adams PD","initials":"PD"},{"last_name":"Afonine","full_name":"Afonine PV","initials":"PV"},{"last_name":"Bunk\u00f3czi","full_name":"Bunk\u00f3czi G","initials":"G"},{"last_name":"Chen","full_name":"Chen VB","initials":"VB"},{"last_name":"Davis","full_name":"Davis IW","initials":"IW"},{"last_name":"Echols","full_name":"Echols N","initials":"N"},{"last_name":"Headd","full_name":"Headd JJ","initials":"JJ"},{"last_name":"Hung","full_name":"Hung LW","initials":"LW"},{"last_name":"Kapral","full_name":"Kapral GJ","initials":"GJ"},{"last_name":"Grosse-Kunstleve","full_name":"Grosse-Kunstleve RW","initials":"RW"},{"last_name":"McCoy","full_name":"McCoy AJ","initials":"AJ"},{"last_name":"Moriarty","full_name":"Moriarty NW","initials":"NW"},{"last_name":"Oeffner","full_name":"Oeffner R","initials":"R"},{"last_name":"Read","full_name":"Read RJ","initials":"RJ"},{"last_name":"Richardson","full_name":"Richardson DC","initials":"DC"},{"last_name":"Richardson","full_name":"Richardson JS","initials":"JS"},{"last_name":"Terwilliger","full_name":"Terwilliger TC","initials":"TC"},{"last_name":"Zwart","full_name":"Zwart PH","initials":"PH"}],"title":"PHENIX: a comprehensive Python-based system for macromolecular structure solution.","pubmed_id":"20124702","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1107/S0907444909052925"}]}
