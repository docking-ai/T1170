It consists of 143 amino acids and has an isoelectric point of 10.9. Crystals of Rv0880 belonged to space group P1, with unit-cell parameters a = 54.97, b = 69.60, c = 70.32 \u00c5, \u03b1 = 103.71, \u03b2 = 111.06, \u03b3 = 105.83\u00b0. The structure of the MarR family transcription regulator Rv0880 was solved at a resolution of 2.0 \u00c5 with an R(cryst) and R(free) of 21.2 and 24.9%, respectively. The dimeric structure resembles that of other MarR proteins, with each subunit comprising a winged helix-turn-helix domain connected to an \u03b1-helical dimerization domain.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Gao","full_name":"Gao YR","initials":"YR"},{"last_name":"Feng","full_name":"Feng N","initials":"N"},{"last_name":"Chen","full_name":"Chen T","initials":"T"},{"last_name":"Li","full_name":"Li de F","initials":"de F"},{"last_name":"Bi","full_name":"Bi LJ","initials":"LJ"}],"title":"Structure of the MarR family protein Rv0880 from Mycobacterium tuberculosis.","pubmed_id":"26057805","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1107/S2053230X15007281"}]}
