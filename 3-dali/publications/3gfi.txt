Here, we present the crystal structure of ST1710 from Sulfolobus tokodaii strain 7 complexed with salicylate, a well-known inhibitor of MarR proteins and the ST1710 complex with its promoter DNA, refined to 1.8 and 2.10 A resolutions, respectively. The ST1710-DNA complex shares the topology of apo-ST1710 and MarR proteins, with each subunit containing a winged helix-turn-helix (wHtH) DNA binding motif. Significantly large conformational changes occurred upon DNA binding and in each of the dimeric monomers in the asymmetric unit of the ST1710-DNA complex. Conserved wHtH loop residues interacting with the bound DNA and mutagenic analysis indicated that R89, R90 and K91 were important for DNA recognition. Significantly, the bound DNA exhibited a new binding mechanism.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Kumarevel","full_name":"Kumarevel T","initials":"T"},{"last_name":"Tanaka","full_name":"Tanaka T","initials":"T"},{"last_name":"Umehara","full_name":"Umehara T","initials":"T"},{"last_name":"Yokoyama","full_name":"Yokoyama S","initials":"S"}],"title":"ST1710-DNA complex crystal structure reveals the DNA binding mechanism of the MarR family of regulators.","pubmed_id":"19509310","type":"J","associated_entries":"2eb7, 3gez, 3gf2, 3gfj, 3gfl, 3gfm","doi":"10.1093/nar/gkp496"},{"journal_info":{"volume":"161","pdb_abbreviation":"J.

Understanding and deciphering the mechanisms of these multiple drug resistance regulatory proteins through structural or biochemical means is an important endeavor.

The overall structure of the ST1710 dimer shares the topology of the MarR family of proteins, with each subunit containing a winged helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif.
