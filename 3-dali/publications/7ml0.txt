Here, we report multiple structures of initiation complexes converted de novo from a 33-subunit yeast pre-initiation complex (PIC) through catalytic activities and subsequently stalled at different template positions. We determine that PICs in the initially transcribing complex (ITC) can synthesize a transcript of \u223c26 nucleotides before transitioning to an elongation complex (EC) as determined by the loss of general transcription factors (GTFs). Unexpectedly, transition to an EC was greatly accelerated when an ITC encountered a downstream EC stalled at promoter proximal regions and resulted in a collided head-to-end dimeric EC complex. Our structural analysis reveals a dynamic state of TFIIH, the largest of GTFs, in PIC/ITC with distinct functional consequences at multiple steps on the pathway to elongation.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Yang","full_name":"Yang C","initials":"C"},{"last_name":"Fujiwara","full_name":"Fujiwara R","initials":"R"},{"last_name":"Kim","full_name":"Kim HJ","initials":"HJ"},{"last_name":"Basnet","full_name":"Basnet P","initials":"P"},{"last_name":"Zhu","full_name":"Zhu Y","initials":"Y"},{"last_name":"Gorbea Col\u00f3n","full_name":"Gorbea Col\u00f3n JJ","initials":"JJ"},{"last_name":"Steimle","full_name":"Steimle S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Garcia","full_name":"Garcia BA","initials":"BA"},{"last_name":"Kaplan","full_name":"Kaplan CD","initials":"CD"},{"last_name":"Murakami","full_name":"Murakami K","initials":"K"}],"title":"Structural visualization of de novo transcription initiation by Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNA polymerase II.","pubmed_id":"35051353","type":"J","associated_entries":"7mei, 7ml1, 7ml2, 7ml3, 7ml4","doi":"10.1016/j.molcel.2021.12.020"}]}
