The COP9 signalosome (CSN) deactivates CRLs by removing NEDD8 from activated Cullins. Here we present structures of the neddylated and deneddylated CSN-CRL2 complexes by combining single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) with chemical cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS). These structures suggest a conserved mechanism of CSN activation, consisting of conformational clamping of the CRL2 substrate by CSN2/CSN4, release of the catalytic CSN5/CSN6 heterodimer and finally activation of the CSN5 deneddylation machinery. Using hydrogen-deuterium exchange\u00a0(HDX)-MS we show that CRL2 activates CSN5/CSN6 in a neddylation-independent manner. The presence of NEDD8 is required to activate the CSN5 active site. Overall, by synergising cryo-EM with MS, we identify sensory regions of the CSN that mediate its stepwise activation and provide a framework for understanding the regulatory mechanism of other Cullin family members.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Faull","full_name":"Faull SV","initials":"SV"},{"last_name":"Lau","full_name":"Lau AMC","initials":"AMC"},{"last_name":"Martens","full_name":"Martens C","initials":"C"},{"last_name":"Ahdash","full_name":"Ahdash Z","initials":"Z"},{"last_name":"Hansen","full_name":"Hansen K","initials":"K"},{"last_name":"Yebenes","full_name":"Yebenes H","initials":"H"},{"last_name":"Schmidt","full_name":"Schmidt C","initials":"C"},{"last_name":"Beuron","full_name":"Beuron F","initials":"F"},{"last_name":"Cronin","full_name":"Cronin NB","initials":"NB"},{"last_name":"Morris","full_name":"Morris EP","initials":"EP"},{"last_name":"Politis","full_name":"Politis A","initials":"A"}],"pubmed_id":"31444342","type":"J"}]}
