LonA behaves as a homomeric hexamer in the presence of magnesium (Mg(2+)) and performs ATP-dependent proteolysis. However, it is also found that LonA can carry out Mg(2+)-dependent degradation of unfolded protein substrate in an ATP-independent manner. Here we show that in the presence of Mg(2+) LonA forms a non-secluded hexameric barrel with prominent openings, which explains why Mg(2+)-activated LonA can operate as a diffusion-based chambered protease to degrade unstructured protein and peptide substrates efficiently in the absence of ATP. A 1.85\u00a0\u00c5 crystal structure of\u00a0Mg(2+)-activated protease domain reveals Mg(2+)-dependent remodeling of a substrate-binding loop and a potential metal-binding site near the Ser-Lys catalytic dyad, supported by biophysical binding assays and molecular dynamics simulations. Together, these findings reveal the specific roles of Mg(2+) in the molecular assembly and activation of LonA.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Su","full_name":"Su SC","initials":"SC"},{"last_name":"Lin","full_name":"Lin CC","initials":"CC"},{"last_name":"Tai","full_name":"Tai HC","initials":"HC"},{"last_name":"Chang","full_name":"Chang MY","initials":"MY"},{"last_name":"Ho","full_name":"Ho MR","initials":"MR"},{"last_name":"Babu","full_name":"Babu CS","initials":"CS"},{"last_name":"Liao","full_name":"Liao JH","initials":"JH"},{"last_name":"Wu","full_name":"Wu SH","initials":"SH"},{"last_name":"Chang","full_name":"Chang YC","initials":"YC"},{"last_name":"Lim","full_name":"Lim C","initials":"C"},{"last_name":"Chang","full_name":"Chang CI","initials":"CI"}],"title":"Structural Basis for the Magnesium-Dependent Activation and Hexamerization of the Lon AAA+ Protease.","pubmed_id":"27041593","type":"J","associated_entries":"4ypm","doi":"10.1016/j.str.2016.03.003"}]}
