We report the cryo-EM structures of the \u03b1-SNAP-SNARE subcomplex and the NSF-D1D2 domain in the 20S complex at 3.9- and 3.7-\u00c5 resolutions, respectively. Combined with the biochemical and electrophysiological analyses, we find that \u03b1-SNAPs use R116 through electrostatic interactions and L197 through hydrophobic interactions to apply force mainly on two positions of the VAMP protein to execute disassembly process. Furthermore, we define the interaction between the amino terminus of the SNARE helical bundle and the pore loop of the NSF-D1 domain and demonstrate its essential role as a potential anchor for SNARE complex disassembly. Our studies provide a rotation model of \u03b1-SNAP-mediated disassembly of the SNARE complex.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Huang","full_name":"Huang X","initials":"X"},{"last_name":"Sun","full_name":"Sun S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Wang","full_name":"Wang X","initials":"X"},{"last_name":"Fan","full_name":"Fan F","initials":"F"},{"last_name":"Zhou","full_name":"Zhou Q","initials":"Q"},{"last_name":"Lu","full_name":"Lu S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Cao","full_name":"Cao Y","initials":"Y"},{"last_name":"Wang","full_name":"Wang QW","initials":"QW"},{"last_name":"Dong","full_name":"Dong MQ","initials":"MQ"},{"last_name":"Yao","full_name":"Yao J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Sui","full_name":"Sui SF","initials":"SF"}],"pubmed_id":"30989110","type":"J"}]}
