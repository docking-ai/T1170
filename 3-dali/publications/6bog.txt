It stimulates RNAP recycling during transcription. We report a structure of RapA that is also a full-length structure for the entire Swi2/Snf2 family. RapA contains seven domains, two of which exhibit novel protein folds. Our model of RapA in complex with ATP and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) suggests that RapA may bind to and translocate on dsDNA. Our kinetic template-switching assay shows that RapA facilitates the release of sequestered RNAP from a posttranscrption/posttermination complex for transcription reinitiation. Our in vitro competition experiment indicates that RapA binds to core RNAP only but is readily displaceable by sigma70. RapA is likely another general transcription factor, the structure of which provides a framework for future studies of this bacterial Swi2/Snf2 protein and its important roles in RNAP recycling during transcription.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Shaw","full_name":"Shaw G","initials":"G"},{"last_name":"Gan","full_name":"Gan J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Zhou","full_name":"Zhou YN","initials":"YN"},{"last_name":"Zhi","full_name":"Zhi H","initials":"H"},{"last_name":"Subburaman","full_name":"Subburaman P","initials":"P"},{"last_name":"Zhang","full_name":"Zhang R","initials":"R"},{"last_name":"Joachimiak","full_name":"Joachimiak A","initials":"A"},{"last_name":"Jin","full_name":"Jin DJ","initials":"DJ"},{"last_name":"Ji","full_name":"Ji X","initials":"X"}],"title":"Structure of RapA, a Swi2/Snf2 protein that recycles RNA polymerase during transcription.","pubmed_id":"18786404","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1016/j.str.2008.06.012"},{"journal_info":{"volume":"290","pdb_abbreviation":"J.

In bacteria, RapA is an RNA polymerase (RNAP)-associated Swi2/Snf2 protein that mediates RNAP recycling during transcription. It is known that the ATPase activity of RapA is stimulated by its interaction with RNAP. It is not known, however, how the RapA-RNAP interaction activates the enzyme. Previously, we determined the crystal structure of RapA. The structure revealed the dynamic nature of its N-terminal domain (Ntd), which prompted us to elucidate the solution structure and activity of both the full-length protein and its Ntd-truncated mutant (RapA\u0394N). Here, we report the ATPase activity of RapA and RapA\u0394N in the absence or presence of RNAP and the solution structures of RapA and RapA\u0394N either ligand-free or in complex with RNAP. Determined by small-angle x-ray scattering, the solution structures reveal a new conformation of RapA, define the binding mode and binding site of RapA on RNAP, and show that the binding sites of RapA and \u03c3(70) on the surface of RNAP largely overlap. We conclude that the ATPase activity of RapA is inhibited by its Ntd but stimulated by RNAP in an allosteric fashion and that the conformational changes of RapA and its interaction with RNAP are essential for RNAP recycling. These and previous findings outline the functional cycle of RapA, which increases our understanding of the mechanism and regulation of Swi2/Snf2 proteins in general and of RapA in particular. The new structural information also leads to a hypothetical model of RapA in complex with RNAP immobilized during transcription.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Kakar","full_name":"Kakar S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Fang","full_name":"Fang X","initials":"X"},{"last_name":"Lubkowska","full_name":"Lubkowska L","initials":"L"},{"last_name":"Zhou","full_name":"Zhou YN","initials":"YN"},{"last_name":"Shaw","full_name":"Shaw GX","initials":"GX"},{"last_name":"Wang","full_name":"Wang YX","initials":"YX"},{"last_name":"Jin","full_name":"Jin DJ","initials":"DJ"},{"last_name":"Kashlev","full_name":"Kashlev M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Ji","full_name":"Ji X","initials":"X"}],"title":"Allosteric Activation of Bacterial Swi2/Snf2 (Switch/Sucrose Non-fermentable) Protein RapA by RNA Polymerase: BIOCHEMICAL AND STRUCTURAL STUDIES.","pubmed_id":"26272746","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1074/jbc.M114.618801"}]}
