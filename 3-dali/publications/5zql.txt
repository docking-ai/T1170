Here, we report X-ray crystal structures of the apo and ATP\u03b3S-bound states of the catalytic AAA domain of human katanin p60 at 3.0 and 2.9\u00a0\u00c5 resolution, respectively. Comparison of the two structures reveals conformational changes induced by ATP binding and how such changes ensure hexamer stability. Moreover, we uncover structural details of pore loops (PLs) and show that Arg283, a residue unique to katanin among MT-severing enzymes, protrudes from PL1 and lines the entry of the catalytic pore. Functional studies suggest that PL1 and Arg283 play essential roles in the recognition and remodeling of the glutamylated, C-terminal tubulin tail and regulation of axon growth. In addition, domain-swapping experiments in katanin and spastin suggest that the non-homologous N-terminal region, which contains the MT-interacting and trafficking domain and a linker, confers specificity to the severing process.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Shin","full_name":"Shin SC","initials":"SC"},{"last_name":"Im","full_name":"Im SK","initials":"SK"},{"last_name":"Jang","full_name":"Jang EH","initials":"EH"},{"last_name":"Jin","full_name":"Jin KS","initials":"KS"},{"last_name":"Hur","full_name":"Hur EM","initials":"EM"},{"last_name":"Kim","full_name":"Kim EE","initials":"EE"}],"pubmed_id":"30699360","type":"J"}]}
