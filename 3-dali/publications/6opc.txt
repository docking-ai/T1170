Despite extensive studies, the mechanism of Cdc48 has remained obscure, and its reported structures are inconsistent with models of substrate translocation proposed for other AAA+ ATPases. Here, we report a 3.7 \u00c5 resolution structure of Cdc48 in complex with an adaptor protein and a native substrate. Cdc48 engages substrate by adopting a helical configuration of substrate-binding residues that extends through the central pore of both of the ATPase rings. These findings indicate a unified hand-over-hand mechanism of protein translocation by Cdc48 and other AAA+ ATPases.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Cooney","full_name":"Cooney I","initials":"I"},{"last_name":"Han","full_name":"Han H","initials":"H"},{"last_name":"Stewart","full_name":"Stewart MG","initials":"MG"},{"last_name":"Carson","full_name":"Carson RH","initials":"RH"},{"last_name":"Hansen","full_name":"Hansen DT","initials":"DT"},{"last_name":"Iwasa","full_name":"Iwasa JH","initials":"JH"},{"last_name":"Price","full_name":"Price JC","initials":"JC"},{"last_name":"Hill","full_name":"Hill CP","initials":"CP"},{"last_name":"Shen","full_name":"Shen PS","initials":"PS"}],"title":"Structure of the Cdc48 segregase in the act of unfolding an authentic substrate.","pubmed_id":"31249134","type":"J","associated_entries":"6omb","doi":"10.1126/science.aax0486"}]}
