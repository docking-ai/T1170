We determined crystal structures of two (S)-selective \u03c9-transaminases, one from Arthrobacter sp. (Ars-\u03c9TA) and one from Bacillus megaterium (BM-\u03c9TA), which have 95% sequence identity, but somewhat different activity profiles. Substrate-profiling measurements using a range of (R)- and (S)-substrates showed that both enzymes have a preference for substrates with large planar side groups for which the activity of BM-\u03c9TA is generally somewhat higher. BM-\u03c9TA has a significantly higher preference for (S)-3,3-dimethyl-2-butylamine than Ars-\u03c9TA, as well as a more relaxed enantiopreference towards 1-cyclopropylethylamine. The crystal structures showed that, as expected for (S)-selective transaminases, both enzymes have the typical transaminase type I fold, and have spacious active sites to accommodate largish substrates. A structure of BM-\u03c9TA with bound (R)-\u03b1-methylbenzylamine explains the enzymes' preference for (S)-substrates. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments revealed that the presence of a tyrosine instead of a cysteine at position 60 increases the relative activities on several small substrates. A structure of Ars-\u03c9TA with bound L-Ala revealed that the Arg442 side chain has repositioned to bind the L-Ala carboxylate. Compared to the arginine switch residue in other transaminases, Arg442 is shifted by six residues in the amino acid sequence, which appears to be a consequence of extra loops near the active site that narrow the entrance to the active site.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"van Oosterwijk","full_name":"van Oosterwijk N","initials":"N"},{"last_name":"Willies","full_name":"Willies SC","initials":"SC"},{"last_name":"Hekelaar","full_name":"Hekelaar J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Terwisscha van Scheltinga","full_name":"Terwisscha van Scheltinga AC","initials":"AC"},{"last_name":"Turner","full_name":"Turner NJ","initials":"NJ"},{"last_name":"Dijkstra","full_name":"Dijkstra BW","initials":"BW"}],"title":"Structural basis of substrate range and enantioselectivity of two (S)-selective \u03c9-transaminases.","pubmed_id":"27428867","type":"J","associated_entries":"5g09, 5g0a, 5g2q","doi":"10.1021/acs.biochem.6b00370"}]}
