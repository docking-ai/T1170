They are composed of three components: TcA, TcB, and TcC. Low-resolution structures of TcAs from different bacteria suggest a considerable difference in their architecture and possibly in their mechanism of action. Here, we present high-resolution structures of five TcAs from insect and human pathogens, which show a similar overall composition and domain organization. Essential structural features, including a trefoil protein knot, are present in all TcAs, suggesting a common mechanism of action. All TcAs form functional pores and can be combined with TcB-TcC subunits from other species to form active chimeric holotoxins. We identified a conserved ionic pair that stabilizes the shell, likely operating as a strong latch that only springs open after destabilization of other regions. Our results provide new insights into the architecture and mechanism of the Tc toxin family.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Leidreiter","full_name":"Leidreiter F","initials":"F"},{"last_name":"Roderer","full_name":"Roderer D","initials":"D"},{"last_name":"Meusch","full_name":"Meusch D","initials":"D"},{"last_name":"Gatsogiannis","full_name":"Gatsogiannis C","initials":"C"},{"last_name":"Benz","full_name":"Benz R","initials":"R"},{"last_name":"Raunser","full_name":"Raunser S","initials":"S"}],"title":"Common architecture of Tc toxins from human and insect pathogenic bacteria.","pubmed_id":"31663026","type":"J","associated_entries":"6rw6, 6rw8, 6rw9, 6rwa","doi":"10.1126/sciadv.aax6497"}]}
