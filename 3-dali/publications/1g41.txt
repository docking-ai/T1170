The crystals in which the structure was solved have an unusual twinning, or one-dimensional disorder, in which each successive crystal-packing layer is displaced laterally relative to the one below it. A model for the twinning and an algorithm for detwinning the data are described. It is known from other work that when the HslU hexamer binds its cognate protease HslV, the carboxy-terminal helices of HslU protomers distend and bind between HslV subunits. Comparison of HslU alone with its structure in the HslUV complex reveals several conserved amino-acid residues whose side-chain interactions differ between the two structures, suggesting that they may be part of a conformational switch that facilitates the release of the HslU carboxy-terminal helices when HslV binds.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Trame","full_name":"Trame CB","initials":"CB"},{"last_name":"McKay","full_name":"McKay DB","initials":"DB"}],"title":"Structure of Haemophilus influenzae HslU protein in crystals with one-dimensional disorder twinning.","pubmed_id":"11468391","type":"J","associated_entries":"1g3i, 1g3k, 1im2","doi":"10.1107/S0907444901007673"},{"journal_info":{"volume":"103","pdb_abbreviation":"Cell","ISO_abbreviation":"Cell","year":2000,"issue":"4","pages":"633-43"},"abstract":{"methods":null,"conclusions":null,"results":null,"unassigned":"HslUV is a \"prokaryotic proteasome\" composed of the HslV protease and the HslU ATPase, a chaperone of the Clp/Hsp100 family. The 3.4 A crystal structure of an HslUV complex is presented here. Two hexameric ATP binding rings of HslU bind intimately to opposite sides of the HslV protease; the HslU \"intermediate domains\" extend outward from the complex. The solution structure of HslUV, derived from small angle X-ray scattering data under conditions where the complex is assembled and active, agrees with this crystallographic structure. When the complex forms, the carboxy-terminal helices of HslU distend and bind between subunits of HslV, and the apical helices of HslV shift substantially, transmitting a conformational change to the active site region of the protease.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Sousa","full_name":"Sousa MC","initials":"MC"},{"last_name":"Trame","full_name":"Trame CB","initials":"CB"},{"last_name":"Tsuruta","full_name":"Tsuruta H","initials":"H"},{"last_name":"Wilbanks","full_name":"Wilbanks SM","initials":"SM"},{"last_name":"Reddy","full_name":"Reddy VS","initials":"VS"},{"last_name":"McKay","full_name":"McKay DB","initials":"DB"}],"title":"Crystal and solution structures of an HslUV protease-chaperone complex.","pubmed_id":"11106733","type":"J","associated_entries":"1g3i, 1g3k, 1im2","doi":"10.1016/S0092-8674(00)00166-5"},{"journal_info":{"volume":"403","pdb_abbreviation":"Nature","ISO_abbreviation":null,"year":2000,"issue":null,"pages":"800-805"},"abstract":{"methods":null,"conclusions":null,"results":null,"unassigned":null,"background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":null,"full_name":"Bochtler, M.","initials":null},{"last_name":null,"full_name":"Hartmann, C.","initials":null},{"last_name":null,"full_name":"Song, H.K.","initials":null},{"last_name":null,"full_name":"Bourenkov, G.P.","initials":null},{"last_name":null,"full_name":"Bartunik, H.D.","initials":null},{"last_name":null,"full_name":"Huber, R.","initials":null}],"title":"The Structures of HslU and the ATP-dependent Protease HslU-HslV","pubmed_id":null,"type":"J","associated_entries":"1g3i, 1g3k, 1im2","doi":"10.1038/35001629"}]}
