Here we report the reconstruction using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy of the complex between subunits BchD and BchI of Rhodobacter capsulatus Mg-chelatase in the presence of ADP, the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog AMPPNP, and ATP at 7.5 A, 14 A, and 13 A resolution, respectively. We show that the two AAA+ modules of the subunits form a unique complex of 3 dimers related by a three-fold axis. The reconstructions demonstrate substantial differences between the conformations of the complex in the presence of ATP and ADP, and suggest that the C-terminal integrin-I domains of the BchD subunits play a central role in transmitting conformational changes of BchI to BchD. Based on these data a model for the function of magnesium chelatase is proposed.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Lundqvist","full_name":"Lundqvist J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Elmlund","full_name":"Elmlund H","initials":"H"},{"last_name":"Wulff","full_name":"Wulff RP","initials":"RP"},{"last_name":"Berglund","full_name":"Berglund L","initials":"L"},{"last_name":"Elmlund","full_name":"Elmlund D","initials":"D"},{"last_name":"Emanuelsson","full_name":"Emanuelsson C","initials":"C"},{"last_name":"Hebert","full_name":"Hebert H","initials":"H"},{"last_name":"Willows","full_name":"Willows RD","initials":"RD"},{"last_name":"Hansson","full_name":"Hansson M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Lindahl","full_name":"Lindahl M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Al-Karadaghi","full_name":"Al-Karadaghi S","initials":"S"}],"title":"ATP-induced conformational dynamics in the AAA+ motor unit of magnesium chelatase.","pubmed_id":"20223218","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1016/j.str.2010.01.001"}]}
