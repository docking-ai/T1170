In <i>E. coli</i> and other eubacteria, the tmRNA system rescues stalled ribosomes and adds an ssrA tag or degron to the C-terminus of the incomplete protein, which directs degradation by the AAA+ ClpXP protease. Here, we present cryo-EM structures of ClpXP bound to the ssrA degron. C-terminal residues of the ssrA degron initially bind in the top of an otherwise closed ClpX axial channel and subsequently move deeper into an open channel. For short-degron protein substrates, we show that unfolding can occur directly from the initial closed-channel complex. For longer-degron substrates, our studies illuminate how ClpXP transitions from specific recognition into a nonspecific unfolding and translocation machine. Many AAA+ proteases and protein-remodeling motors are likely to employ similar multistep recognition and engagement strategies.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Fei","full_name":"Fei X","initials":"X"},{"last_name":"Bell","full_name":"Bell TA","initials":"TA"},{"last_name":"Barkow","full_name":"Barkow SR","initials":"SR"},{"last_name":"Baker","full_name":"Baker TA","initials":"TA"},{"last_name":"Sauer","full_name":"Sauer RT","initials":"RT"}],"title":"Structural basis of ClpXP recognition and unfolding of ssrA-tagged substrates.","pubmed_id":"33089779","type":"J","associated_entries":"6wr2, 6wrf","doi":"10.7554/eLife.61496"}]}
