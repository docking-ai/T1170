Although catalytic mechanisms for simple, dimeric endonucleases are known, there are many complex nuclease machines that are poorly understood. Here we studied the single polypeptide Type ISP restriction-modification (RM) enzymes, which cleave random DNA between distant target sites when two enzymes collide after convergent ATP-driven translocation. We report the 2.7-\u00c5 resolution X-ray crystal structure of a Type ISP enzyme-DNA complex, revealing that both the helicase-like ATPase and nuclease are located upstream of the direction of translocation, an observation inconsistent with simple nuclease-domain dimerization. Using single-molecule and biochemical techniques, we demonstrate that each ATPase remodels its DNA-protein complex and translocates along DNA without looping it, leading to a collision complex in which the nuclease domains are distal. Sequencing of the products of single cleavage events suggests a previously undescribed endonuclease model, where multiple, stochastic strand-nicking events combine to produce DNA scission.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Chand","full_name":"Chand MK","initials":"MK"},{"last_name":"Nirwan","full_name":"Nirwan N","initials":"N"},{"last_name":"Diffin","full_name":"Diffin FM","initials":"FM"},{"last_name":"van Aelst","full_name":"van Aelst K","initials":"K"},{"last_name":"Kulkarni","full_name":"Kulkarni M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Pernstich","full_name":"Pernstich C","initials":"C"},{"last_name":"Szczelkun","full_name":"Szczelkun MD","initials":"MD"},{"last_name":"Saikrishnan","full_name":"Saikrishnan K","initials":"K"}],"title":"Translocation-coupled DNA cleavage by the Type ISP restriction-modification enzymes.","pubmed_id":"26389736","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1038/nchembio.1926"}]}
