Here, we unveil the machinery and assembly mechanism of the archaeal Sulfolobus pNOB8 partition system. This system uses three proteins: ParA; an atypical ParB adaptor; and a centromere-binding component, AspA. AspA utilizes a spreading mechanism to create a DNA superhelix onto which ParB assembles. This supercomplex links to the ParA motor, which contains a bacteria-like Walker motif. The C domain of ParB harbors structural similarity to CenpA, which dictates eukaryotic segregation. Thus, this archaeal system combines bacteria-like and eukarya-like components, which suggests the possible conservation of DNA segregation principles across the three domains of life.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Schumacher","full_name":"Schumacher MA","initials":"MA"},{"last_name":"Tonthat","full_name":"Tonthat NK","initials":"NK"},{"last_name":"Lee","full_name":"Lee J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Rodriguez-Casta\u00f1eda","full_name":"Rodriguez-Casta\u00f1eda FA","initials":"FA"},{"last_name":"Chinnam","full_name":"Chinnam NB","initials":"NB"},{"last_name":"Kalliomaa-Sanford","full_name":"Kalliomaa-Sanford AK","initials":"AK"},{"last_name":"Ng","full_name":"Ng IW","initials":"IW"},{"last_name":"Barge","full_name":"Barge MT","initials":"MT"},{"last_name":"Shaw","full_name":"Shaw PL","initials":"PL"},{"last_name":"Barill\u00e0","full_name":"Barill\u00e0 D","initials":"D"}],"title":"Structures of archaeal DNA segregation machinery reveal bacterial and eukaryotic linkages.","pubmed_id":"26339031","type":"J","associated_entries":"4rs7, 5k5a, 5k5d, 5k5o, 5k5q, 5k5r, 5k5z","doi":"10.1126/science.aaa9046"}]}
