Such modification induces the expression of a peroxidase that reduces OHPs to their less toxic alcohols. Here, we describe the structures of reduced and OHP-oxidized OhrR, visualizing the structural mechanism of OHP induction. Reduced OhrR takes a canonical MarR family fold with C22 and C127' separated by 15.5 A. OHP oxidation results in the disruption of the Y36'-C22-Y47' interaction network and dissection of helix alpha5, which then allows the 135 degrees rotation and 8.2 A translation of C127', formation of the C22-C127' disulphide bond, and alpha6-alpha6' helix-swapped reconfiguration of the dimer interface. These changes result in the 28 degrees rigid body rotations of each winged helix-turn-helix motif and DNA dissociation. Similar effector-induced rigid body rotations are expected for most MarR family members.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Newberry","full_name":"Newberry KJ","initials":"KJ"},{"last_name":"Fuangthong","full_name":"Fuangthong M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Panmanee","full_name":"Panmanee W","initials":"W"},{"last_name":"Mongkolsuk","full_name":"Mongkolsuk S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Brennan","full_name":"Brennan RG","initials":"RG"}],"title":"Structural mechanism of organic hydroperoxide induction of the transcription regulator OhrR.","pubmed_id":"18042459","type":"J","associated_entries":"2pfb","doi":"10.1016/j.molcel.2007.09.016"},{"journal_info":{"volume":"188","pdb_abbreviation":"J Bacteriol","ISO_abbreviation":"J Bacteriol","year":2006,"issue":"4","pages":"1389-95"},"abstract":{"methods":null,"conclusions":null,"results":null,"unassigned":"Xanthomonas campestris pv. phaseoli OhrR belongs to a major family of multiple-cysteine-containing bacterial organic hydroperoxide sensors and transcription repressors. Site-directed mutagenesis and subsequent in vivo functional analyses revealed that changing any cysteine residue to serine did not alter the ability of OhrR to bind to the P1 ohrR-ohr promoter but drastically affected the organic hydroperoxide-sensing and response mechanisms of the protein. Xanthomonas OhrR requires two cysteine residues, C22 and C127, to sense and respond to organic hydroperoxides. Analysis of the free thiol groups in wild-type and mutant OhrRs under reducing and oxidizing conditions indicates that C22 is the organic hydroperoxide-sensing residue. Exposure to organic hydroperoxides led to the formation of an unstable OhrR-C22 sulfenic acid intermediate that could be trapped by 7-chloro-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole and detected by UV-visible spectral analysis in an oxidized C127S-C131S mutant OhrR. In wild-type OhrR, the cysteine sulfenic acid intermediate rapidly reacts with the thiol group of C127, forming a disulfide bond. The high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of tryptic fragments of alkylated, oxidized OhrR and nonreducing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analyses confirmed the formation of reversible intersubunit disulfide bonds between C22 and C127. Oxidation of OhrR led to cross-linking of two OhrR monomers, resulting in the inactivation of its repressor function. Evidence presented here provides insight into a new organic hydroperoxide-sensing and response mechanism for OhrRs of the multiple-cysteine family, the primary bacterial transcription regulator of the organic hydroperoxide stress response.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Panmanee","full_name":"Panmanee W","initials":"W"},{"last_name":"Vattanaviboon","full_name":"Vattanaviboon P","initials":"P"},{"last_name":"Poole","full_name":"Poole LB","initials":"LB"},{"last_name":"Mongkolsuk","full_name":"Mongkolsuk S","initials":"S"}],"title":"Novel organic hydroperoxide-sensing and responding mechanisms for OhrR, a major bacterial sensor and regulator of organic hydroperoxide stress.","pubmed_id":"16452421","type":"J","associated_entries":"2pfb","doi":"10.1128/JB.188.4.1389-1395.2006"}]}
