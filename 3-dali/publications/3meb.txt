Both the open and closed conformations of AAT were observed. Pyridoxal phosphate was bound to the active site via a Schiff base to a conserved lysine. An active-site mutant showed that Trypanosoma brucei AAT still binds pyridoxal phosphate even in the absence of the tethering lysine. The structures highlight the challenges for the structure-based design of inhibitors targeting the active site, while showing options for inhibitor design targeting the N-terminal arm.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Abendroth","full_name":"Abendroth J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Choi","full_name":"Choi R","initials":"R"},{"last_name":"Wall","full_name":"Wall A","initials":"A"},{"last_name":"Clifton","full_name":"Clifton MC","initials":"MC"},{"last_name":"Lukacs","full_name":"Lukacs CM","initials":"CM"},{"last_name":"Staker","full_name":"Staker BL","initials":"BL"},{"last_name":"Van Voorhis","full_name":"Van Voorhis W","initials":"W"},{"last_name":"Myler","full_name":"Myler P","initials":"P"},{"last_name":"Lorimer","full_name":"Lorimer DD","initials":"DD"},{"last_name":"Edwards","full_name":"Edwards TE","initials":"TE"}],"title":"Structures of aspartate aminotransferases from Trypanosoma brucei, Leishmania major and Giardia lamblia.","pubmed_id":"25945710","type":"J","associated_entries":"4eu1, 4h51, 4w5k","doi":"10.1107/S2053230X15001831"}]}
