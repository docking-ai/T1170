Substrates are targeted to a single soluble protease, the 26S proteasome, in eukaryotes and to a number of unrelated proteases in prokaryotes. A surprising link emerged with the discovery of the ATP-dependent protease HslVU (heat shock locus VU) in Escherichia coli. Its protease component HslV shares approximately 20% sequence similarity and a conserved fold with 20S proteasome beta-subunits. HslU is a member of the Hsp100 (Clp) family of ATPases. Here we report the crystal structures of free HslU and an 820,000 relative molecular mass complex of HslU and HslV-the first structure of a complete set of components of an ATP-dependent protease. HslV and HslU display sixfold symmetry, ruling out mechanisms of protease activation that require a symmetry mismatch between the two components. Instead, there is conformational flexibility and domain motion in HslU and a localized order-disorder transition in HslV. Individual subunits of HslU contain two globular domains in relative orientations that correlate with nucleotide bound and unbound states. They are surprisingly similar to their counterparts in N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein, the prototype of an AAA-ATPase. A third, mostly alpha-helical domain in HslU mediates the contact with HslV and may be the structural equivalent of the amino-terminal domains in proteasomal AAA-ATPases.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Bochtler","full_name":"Bochtler M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Hartmann","full_name":"Hartmann C","initials":"C"},{"last_name":"Song","full_name":"Song HK","initials":"HK"},{"last_name":"Bourenkov","full_name":"Bourenkov GP","initials":"GP"},{"last_name":"Bartunik","full_name":"Bartunik HD","initials":"HD"},{"last_name":"Huber","full_name":"Huber R","initials":"R"}],"pubmed_id":"10693812","type":"J"},{"journal_info":{"volume":"94","pdb_abbreviation":"Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","ISO_abbreviation":"Proc.

It has sequence similarity with the beta-type subunits of the eukaryotic and archaebacterial proteasomes. Unlike these particles, which display 72-point symmetry, it is a dimer of hexamers with 62-point symmetry. The crystal structure of HslV at 3.8-A resolution, determined by isomorphous replacement and symmetry averaging, shows that in spite of the different symmetry of the particle, the fold and the contacts between subunits are conserved. A tripeptide aldehyde inhibitor, acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal, binds to the N-terminal threonine residue of HslV, probably as a hemiacetal, relating HslV also functionally to the proteasomes of archaea and eukaryotes.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Bochtler","full_name":"Bochtler M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Ditzel","full_name":"Ditzel L","initials":"L"},{"last_name":"Groll","full_name":"Groll M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Huber","full_name":"Huber R","initials":"R"}],"pubmed_id":"9177170","type":"J"},{"journal_info":{"volume":"93","pdb_abbreviation":"Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","ISO_abbreviation":"Proc.

It is the product of the heat-shock locus hslVU that encodes two proteins: HslV, a 19-kDa protein similar to proteasome beta subunits, and HslU, a 50-kDa protein related to the ATPase ClpX. In the presence of ATP, the protease hydrolyzes rapidly the fluorogenic peptide Z-Gly-Gly-Leu-AMC and very slowly certain other chymotrypsin substrates. This activity increased 10-fold in E. coli expressing heat-shock proteins constitutively and 100-fold in cells expressing HslV and HslU from a high copy plasmid. Although HslV and HslU could be coimmunoprecipitated from cell extracts of both strains with an anti-HslV antibody, these two components were readily separated by various types of chromatography. ATP stimulated peptidase activity up to 150-fold, whereas other nucleoside triphosphates, a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, ADP, or AMP had no effect. Peptidase activity was blocked by the anti-HslV antibody and by several types of inhibitors of the eukaryotic proteasome (a threonine protease) but not by inhibitors of other classes of proteases. Unlike eukaryotic proteasomes, the HslVU protease lacked tryptic-like and peptidyl-glutamyl-peptidase activities. Electron micrographs reveal ring-shaped particles similar to en face images of the 20S proteasome or the ClpAP protease. Thus, HslV and HslU appear to form a complex in which ATP hydrolysis by HslU is essential for peptide hydrolysis by the proteasome-like component HslV.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Rohrwild","full_name":"Rohrwild M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Coux","full_name":"Coux O","initials":"O"},{"last_name":"Huang","full_name":"Huang HC","initials":"HC"},{"last_name":"Moerschell","full_name":"Moerschell RP","initials":"RP"},{"last_name":"Yoo","full_name":"Yoo SJ","initials":"SJ"},{"last_name":"Seol","full_name":"Seol JH","initials":"JH"},{"last_name":"Chung","full_name":"Chung CH","initials":"CH"},{"last_name":"Goldberg","full_name":"Goldberg AL","initials":"AL"}],"pubmed_id":"8650174","type":"J"},{"journal_info":{"volume":"134","pdb_abbreviation":"Gene","ISO_abbreviation":"Gene","year":1993,"issue":"1","pages":"1-6"},"doi":null,"associated_entries":"1do2, 1ned","title":"Sequence analysis of four new heat-shock genes constituting the hslTS/ibpAB and hslVU operons in Escherichia coli.","abstract":{"methods":null,"conclusions":null,"results":null,"unassigned":"Sequences of four new heat-shock (HS) genes of Escherichia coli organized into two operons were determined. The operon at 83 min specifies two proteins of 15.8 kDa (HslT) and 16.1 kDa (HslS), which are identical to IbpA and IbpB, respectively. Expression of mRNA from a sigma 32-dependent promoter of the hslTS/ibpAB operon is stimulated 30-75-fold upon temperature upshift. The transcription start point (tsp) is located at a G, 96 bp upstream from the AUG start codon of hslT/ibpA. The deduced amino acid sequences of HslT/IbpA and HslS/IbpB are 48% identical to each other and were found to be remotely related to the chloroplast low-molecular-weight HS protein, which is highly conserved among plants. The second hs operon is much less actively stimulated by temperature upshift, although it has a hs promoter that perfectly matches the consensus of promoters recognized by sigma 32. Located at 88.9 min, the hslVU operon specifies proteins of 19.1 kDa (HslV) and 49.6 kDa (HslU). Multiple tsp were found in this operon. HslV is remotely related to the eukaryotic proteasome proteins, and HslU is very similar to a Pasteurella haemolytica protein of unknown function. Both HslU and the P. haemolytica protein share a ATP/GTP-binding motif near their N-termini.
