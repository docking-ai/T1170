We report the first crystal structure for such an ATPase, NtrC1 of Aquifex aeolicus, in which the catalytic arginine engages the \u03b3-phosphate of ATP. Comparing the new structure with those previously known for apo and ADP-bound states supports a rigid-body displacement model that is consistent with large-scale conformational changes observed by low-resolution methods. First, the arginine finger induces rigid-body roll, extending surface loops above the plane of the ATPase ring to bind \u03c354. Second, ATP hydrolysis permits Pi release and retraction of the arginine with a reversed roll, remodeling \u03c354-RNAP. This model provides a fresh perspective on how ATPase subunits interact within the ring-ensemble to promote transcription, directing attention to structural changes on the arginine-finger side of an ATP-bound interface.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Chen","full_name":"Chen B","initials":"B"},{"last_name":"Sysoeva","full_name":"Sysoeva TA","initials":"TA"},{"last_name":"Chowdhury","full_name":"Chowdhury S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Guo","full_name":"Guo L","initials":"L"},{"last_name":"De Carlo","full_name":"De Carlo S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Hanson","full_name":"Hanson JA","initials":"JA"},{"last_name":"Yang","full_name":"Yang H","initials":"H"},{"last_name":"Nixon","full_name":"Nixon BT","initials":"BT"}],"title":"Engagement of arginine finger to ATP triggers large conformational changes in NtrC1 AAA+ ATPase for remodeling bacterial RNA polymerase.","pubmed_id":"21070941","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1016/j.str.2010.08.018"}]}
