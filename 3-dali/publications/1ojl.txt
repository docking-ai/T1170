Activators of the sigma(54) protein contain a central domain belonging to the AAA+ superfamily of ATPases, members of which function in diverse cellular processes in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. We describe the X-ray structure of an N-terminal domain deletion of the ZraR protein from Salmonella typhimurium, which is a homologue of the general nitrogen regulatory protein NtrC, at 3A resolution. The structure reveals a hexameric ring that is typical for AAA+ containing proteins but which differs from the heptameric ring found in the crystal structure of the AAA+ domain of NtrC1 from Aquifex aeolicus. The dimerisation interface between DNA-binding domains observed in the crystal structure suggests that dodecamers, rather than hexamers, might be the functionally important oligomer.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Sallai","full_name":"Sallai L","initials":"L"},{"last_name":"Tucker","full_name":"Tucker PA","initials":"PA"}],"pubmed_id":"16005641","type":"J"}]}
