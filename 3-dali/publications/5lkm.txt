Bacterial RadA is a conserved HR effector acting with RecA recombinase to promote ssDNA integration. The mechanism of this RadA-mediated assistance to RecA is unknown. Here, we report functional and structural analyses of RadA from the human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae. RadA is found to facilitate RecA-driven ssDNA recombination over long genomic distances during natural transformation. RadA is revealed as a hexameric DnaB-type helicase, which interacts with RecA to promote orientated unwinding of branched DNA molecules mimicking D-loop boundaries. These findings support a model of DNA branch migration in HR, relying on RecA-mediated loading of RadA hexamers on each strand of the recipient dsDNA in the D-loop, from which they migrate divergently to facilitate incorporation of invading ssDNA.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Marie","full_name":"Marie L","initials":"L"},{"last_name":"Rapisarda","full_name":"Rapisarda C","initials":"C"},{"last_name":"Morales","full_name":"Morales V","initials":"V"},{"last_name":"Berg\u00e9","full_name":"Berg\u00e9 M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Perry","full_name":"Perry T","initials":"T"},{"last_name":"Soulet","full_name":"Soulet AL","initials":"AL"},{"last_name":"Gruget","full_name":"Gruget C","initials":"C"},{"last_name":"Remaut","full_name":"Remaut H","initials":"H"},{"last_name":"Fronzes","full_name":"Fronzes R","initials":"R"},{"last_name":"Polard","full_name":"Polard P","initials":"P"}],"title":"Bacterial RadA is a DnaB-type helicase interacting with RecA to promote bidirectional D-loop extension.","pubmed_id":"28561029","type":"J","associated_entries":"5lkq","doi":"10.1038/ncomms15638"}]}
