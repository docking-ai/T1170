A key event in base assembly is the formation of a heterohexameric ring of AAA-ATPases, which is guided by at least four RP assembly chaperones in mammals: PAAF1, p28/gankyrin, p27/PSMD9, and S5b. Using cryogenic electron microscopy, we analyzed the non-AAA structure of the p28-bound human RP at 4.5\u00a0\u00c5 resolution and determined seven distinct conformations of the Rpn1-p28-AAA subcomplex within the p28-bound RP at subnanometer resolutions. Remarkably, the p28-bound AAA ring does not form a channel in the free RP and spontaneously samples multiple \"open\" and \"closed\" topologies at the Rpt2-Rpt6 and Rpt3-Rpt4 interfaces. Our analysis suggests that p28 assists the proteolytic core particle to select a specific conformation of the ATPase ring for RP engagement and is released in a shoehorn-like fashion in the last step of the chaperone-mediated proteasome assembly.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Lu","full_name":"Lu Y","initials":"Y"},{"last_name":"Wu","full_name":"Wu J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Dong","full_name":"Dong Y","initials":"Y"},{"last_name":"Chen","full_name":"Chen S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Sun","full_name":"Sun S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Ma","full_name":"Ma YB","initials":"YB"},{"last_name":"Ouyang","full_name":"Ouyang Q","initials":"Q"},{"last_name":"Finley","full_name":"Finley D","initials":"D"},{"last_name":"Kirschner","full_name":"Kirschner MW","initials":"MW"},{"last_name":"Mao","full_name":"Mao Y","initials":"Y"}],"title":"Conformational Landscape of the p28-Bound Human Proteasome Regulatory Particle.","pubmed_id":"28689658","type":"J","associated_entries":"5vgz, 5vhf, 5vhh, 5vhi, 5vhj, 5vhm, 5vhn, 5vho, 5vhp, 5vhq, 5vhr","doi":"10.1016/j.molcel.2017.06.007"}]}
