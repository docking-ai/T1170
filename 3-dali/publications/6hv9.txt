A key step is the recruitment of GINS that requires the leading-strand polymerase Pol epsilon, composed of Pol2, Dpb2, Dpb3, Dpb4. While a truncation of the catalytic N-terminal Pol2 supports cell division, Dpb2 and C-terminal Pol2 (C-Pol2) are essential for viability. Dpb2 and C-Pol2 are non-catalytic modules, shown or predicted to be related to an exonuclease and DNA polymerase, respectively. Here, we present the cryo-EM\u00a0structure of the isolated C-Pol2/Dpb2 heterodimer, revealing that C-Pol2 contains a DNA polymerase fold. We also present the structure of CMG/C-Pol2/Dpb2 on a DNA fork, and find that polymerase binding changes both the helicase structure and fork-junction engagement. Inter-subunit contacts that keep the helicase-polymerase complex together explain several cellular phenotypes. At least some of these contacts are preserved during Pol epsilon-dependent CMG assembly on path to origin firing, as observed with DNA replication reconstituted in vitro.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Goswami","full_name":"Goswami P","initials":"P"},{"last_name":"Abid Ali","full_name":"Abid Ali F","initials":"F"},{"last_name":"Douglas","full_name":"Douglas ME","initials":"ME"},{"last_name":"Locke","full_name":"Locke J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Purkiss","full_name":"Purkiss A","initials":"A"},{"last_name":"Janska","full_name":"Janska A","initials":"A"},{"last_name":"Eickhoff","full_name":"Eickhoff P","initials":"P"},{"last_name":"Early","full_name":"Early A","initials":"A"},{"last_name":"Nans","full_name":"Nans A","initials":"A"},{"last_name":"Cheung","full_name":"Cheung AMC","initials":"AMC"},{"last_name":"Diffley","full_name":"Diffley JFX","initials":"JFX"},{"last_name":"Costa","full_name":"Costa A","initials":"A"}],"pubmed_id":"30498216","type":"J"}]}
