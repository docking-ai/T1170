Unattached kinetochores control MCC assembly by catalysing a change in the topology of the \u03b2-sheet of MAD2 (an MCC subunit), thereby generating the active closed MAD2 (C-MAD2) conformer<sub>3-5</sub>. Disassembly of free MCC, which is required for SAC inactivation and chromosome segregation, is an ATP-dependent process driven by the AAA+ ATPase TRIP13. In combination with p31<sub>comet</sub>, an SAC antagonist<sub>6</sub>, TRIP13 remodels C-MAD2 into inactive open MAD2 (O-MAD2)<sub>7-10</sub>. Here, we present a mechanism that explains how TRIP13-p31<sub>comet</sub> disassembles the MCC. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of the TRIP13-p31<sub>comet</sub>-C-MAD2-CDC20 complex reveal that p31<sub>comet</sub> recruits C-MAD2 to a defined site on the TRIP13 hexameric ring, positioning the N terminus of C-MAD2 (MAD2<sub>NT</sub>) to insert into the axial pore of TRIP13 and distorting the TRIP13 ring to initiate remodelling. Molecular modelling suggests that by gripping MAD2<sub>NT</sub> within its axial pore, TRIP13 couples sequential ATP-driven translocation of its hexameric ring along MAD2<sub>NT</sub> to push upwards on, and simultaneously rotate, the globular domains of the p31<sub>comet</sub>-C-MAD2 complex. This unwinds a region of the \u03b1A helix of C-MAD2 that is required to stabilize the C-MAD2 \u03b2-sheet, thus destabilizing C-MAD2 in favour of O-MAD2 and dissociating MAD2 from p31<sub>comet</sub>. Our study provides insights into how specific substrates are recruited to AAA+ ATPases through adaptor proteins and suggests a model of how translocation through the axial pore of AAA+ ATPases is coupled to protein remodelling.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Alfieri","full_name":"Alfieri C","initials":"C"},{"last_name":"Chang","full_name":"Chang L","initials":"L"},{"last_name":"Barford","full_name":"Barford D","initials":"D"}],"pubmed_id":"29973720","type":"J"}]}
