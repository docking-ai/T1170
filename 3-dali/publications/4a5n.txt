In this article, we characterize the novel redox-sensing MarR/DUF24-family regulator HypR (YybR) that is activated by disulphide stress caused by diamide and NaOCl in B. subtilis. HypR controls positively a flavin oxidoreductase HypO that confers protection against NaOCl stress. The conserved N-terminal Cys14 residue of HypR has a lower pK(a) of 6.36 and is essential for activation of hypO transcription by disulphide stress. HypR resembles a 2-Cys-type regulator that is activated by Cys14-Cys49' intersubunit disulphide formation. The crystal structures of reduced and oxidized HypR proteins were resolved revealing structural changes of HypR upon oxidation. In reduced HypR a hydrogen-bonding network stabilizes the reactive Cys14 thiolate that is 8-9\u2009\u00c5 apart from Cys49'. HypR oxidation breaks these H-bonds, reorients the monomers and moves the major groove recognition \u03b14 and \u03b14' helices \u223c4\u2009\u00c5 towards each other. This is the first crystal structure of a redox-sensing MarR/DUF24 family protein in bacteria that is activated by NaOCl stress. Since hypochloric acid is released by activated macrophages, related HypR-like regulators could function to protect pathogens against the host immune defense.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Palm","full_name":"Palm GJ","initials":"GJ"},{"last_name":"Khanh Chi","full_name":"Khanh Chi B","initials":"B"},{"last_name":"Waack","full_name":"Waack P","initials":"P"},{"last_name":"Gronau","full_name":"Gronau K","initials":"K"},{"last_name":"Becher","full_name":"Becher D","initials":"D"},{"last_name":"Albrecht","full_name":"Albrecht D","initials":"D"},{"last_name":"Hinrichs","full_name":"Hinrichs W","initials":"W"},{"last_name":"Read","full_name":"Read RJ","initials":"RJ"},{"last_name":"Antelmann","full_name":"Antelmann H","initials":"H"}],"title":"Structural insights into the redox-switch mechanism of the MarR/DUF24-type regulator HypR.","pubmed_id":"22238377","type":"J","associated_entries":"4a5m","doi":"10.1093/nar/gkr1316"}]}
