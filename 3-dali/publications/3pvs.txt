Sequence information identifies MgsA enzymes as members of the clamp loader clade of AAA+ proteins, but structural information defining the family has been limited. Here, the x-ray crystal structure of Escherichia coli MgsA is described, revealing a homotetrameric arrangement for the protein that distinguishes it from other clamp loader clade AAA+ proteins. Each MgsA protomer is composed of three elements as follows: ATP-binding and helical lid domains (conserved among AAA+ proteins) and a tetramerization domain. Although the tetramerization domains bury the greatest amount of surface area in the MgsA oligomer, each of the domains participates in oligomerization to form a highly intertwined quaternary structure. Phosphate is bound at each AAA+ ATP-binding site, but the active sites do not appear to be in a catalytically competent conformation due to displacement of Arg finger residues. E. coli MgsA is also shown to form a complex with the single-stranded DNA-binding protein through co-purification and biochemical studies. MgsA DNA-dependent ATPase activity is inhibited by single-stranded DNA-binding protein. Together, these structural and biochemical observations provide insights into the mechanisms of MgsA family AAA+ proteins.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Page","full_name":"Page AN","initials":"AN"},{"last_name":"George","full_name":"George NP","initials":"NP"},{"last_name":"Marceau","full_name":"Marceau AH","initials":"AH"},{"last_name":"Cox","full_name":"Cox MM","initials":"MM"},{"last_name":"Keck","full_name":"Keck JL","initials":"JL"}],"title":"Structure and biochemical activities of Escherichia coli MgsA.","pubmed_id":"21297161","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1074/jbc.M110.210187"}]}
