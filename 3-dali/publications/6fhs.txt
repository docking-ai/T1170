The position and histone composition of nucleosomes is governed by ATP-dependent chromatin remodellers<sub>1-3</sub> such as the 15-subunit INO80 complex <sub>4</sub> . INO80 regulates gene expression, DNA repair and replication by sliding nucleosomes, the exchange of histone H2A.Z with H2A, and the positioning of\u2009+\u20091 and -1 nucleosomes at promoter DNA<sub>5-8</sub>. The structures and mechanisms of these remodelling reactions are currently unknown. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the evolutionarily conserved core of the INO80 complex from the fungus Chaetomium thermophilum bound to a nucleosome, at a global resolution of 4.3\u2009\u00c5 and with major parts at 3.7\u2009\u00c5. The INO80 core cradles one entire gyre of the nucleosome through multivalent DNA and histone contacts. An Rvb1/Rvb2 AAA<sub>+</sub> ATPase heterohexamer is an assembly scaffold for the complex and acts as a 'stator' for the motor and nucleosome-gripping subunits. The Swi2/Snf2 ATPase motor binds to nucleosomal DNA at superhelical location -6, unwraps approximately 15 base pairs, disrupts the H2A-DNA contacts and is poised to pump entry DNA into the nucleosome. Arp5 and Ies6 bind superhelical locations -2 and -3 to act as a counter grip for the motor, on the other side of the H2A-H2B dimer. The Arp5 insertion domain forms a grappler element that binds the nucleosome dyad, connects the Arp5 actin-fold and entry DNA over a distance of about 90\u2009\u00c5 and packs against histone H2A-H2B near the 'acidic patch'. Our structure together with biochemical data <sub>8</sub> suggests a unified mechanism for nucleosome sliding and histone editing by INO80. The motor is part of a macromolecular ratchet, persistently pumping entry DNA across the H2A-H2B dimer against the Arp5 grip until a large nucleosome translocation step occurs. The transient exposure of H2A-H2B by motor activity as well as differential recognition of H2A.Z and H2A may regulate histone exchange.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Eustermann","full_name":"Eustermann S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Schall","full_name":"Schall K","initials":"K"},{"last_name":"Kostrewa","full_name":"Kostrewa D","initials":"D"},{"last_name":"Lakomek","full_name":"Lakomek K","initials":"K"},{"last_name":"Strauss","full_name":"Strauss M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Moldt","full_name":"Moldt M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Hopfner","full_name":"Hopfner KP","initials":"KP"}],"title":"Structural basis for ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling by the INO80 complex.","pubmed_id":"29643509","type":"J","associated_entries":"6fml","doi":"10.1038/s41586-018-0029-y"}]}
