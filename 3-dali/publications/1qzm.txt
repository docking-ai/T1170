This domain, comprising residues 491-584, was obtained by chymotrypsin digestion of the recombinant full-length protease. The alpha domain of Lon contains four alpha helices and two parallel strands and resembles similar domains found in a variety of ATPases and helicases, including the oligomeric proteases HslVU and ClpAP. The highly conserved \"sensor-2\" Arg residue is located at the beginning of the third helix. Detailed comparison with the structures of 11 similar domains established the putative location of the nucleotide-binding site in this first fragment of Lon for which a crystal structure has become available.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Botos","full_name":"Botos I","initials":"I"},{"last_name":"Melnikov","full_name":"Melnikov EE","initials":"EE"},{"last_name":"Cherry","full_name":"Cherry S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Khalatova","full_name":"Khalatova AG","initials":"AG"},{"last_name":"Rasulova","full_name":"Rasulova FS","initials":"FS"},{"last_name":"Tropea","full_name":"Tropea JE","initials":"JE"},{"last_name":"Maurizi","full_name":"Maurizi MR","initials":"MR"},{"last_name":"Rotanova","full_name":"Rotanova TV","initials":"TV"},{"last_name":"Gustchina","full_name":"Gustchina A","initials":"A"},{"last_name":"Wlodawer","full_name":"Wlodawer A","initials":"A"}],"title":"Crystal structure of the AAA+ alpha domain of E. coli Lon protease at 1.9A resolution.","pubmed_id":"15037242","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1016/j.jsb.2003.09.003"}]}
