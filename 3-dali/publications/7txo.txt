In the heterocystous cyanobacterium Nostoc sp. PCC 7120, one such strategy is the use of an ArsR-SmtB transcriptional regulator RexT that senses H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and upregulates expression of thioredoxin to maintain cellular redox homeostasis. Different from many other members of the ArsR-SmtB family which bind metal ions, RexT has been proposed to use disulfide bond formation as a trigger to bind and release DNA. Here, we present high-resolution crystal structures of RexT in the reduced and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-treated states. These structures reveal that RexT showcases the ArsR-SmtB winged-helix-turn-helix fold and forms a vicinal disulfide bond to orchestrate a response to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. The importance of the disulfide-forming Cys residues was corroborated using site-directed mutagenesis, mass spectrometry, and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-consumption assays. Furthermore, an entrance channel for H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was identified and key residues implicated in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> activation were pinpointed. Finally, bioinformatics analysis of the ArsR-SmtB family indicates that the vicinal disulfide \"redox switch\" is a unique feature of cyanobacteria in the Nostocales order, presenting an interesting case where an ArsR-SmtB protein scaffold has been evolved to showcase peroxidatic activity and facilitate redox-based regulation.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Li","full_name":"Li B","initials":"B"},{"last_name":"Jo","full_name":"Jo M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Liu","full_name":"Liu J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Tian","full_name":"Tian J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Canfield","full_name":"Canfield R","initials":"R"},{"last_name":"Bridwell-Rabb","full_name":"Bridwell-Rabb J","initials":"J"}],"title":"Structural and mechanistic basis for redox sensing by the cyanobacterial transcription regulator RexT.","pubmed_id":"35347217","type":"J","associated_entries":"7txm, 7txn","doi":"10.1038/s42003-022-03226-x"}]}
