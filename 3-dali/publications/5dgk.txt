Although the mobile genomic island responsible for this phenotype, staphylococcal cassette chromosome (SCC), has been thought to be nonreplicative, we predicted DNA-replication-related functions for some of the conserved proteins encoded by SCC. We show that one of these, Cch, is homologous to the self-loading initiator helicases of an unrelated family of genomic islands, that it is an active 3'-to-5' helicase and that the adjacent ORF encodes a single-stranded DNA-binding protein. Our 2.9-\u00c5 crystal structure of intact Cch shows that it forms a hexameric ring. Cch, like the archaeal and eukaryotic MCM-family replicative helicases, belongs to the pre-sensor II insert clade of AAA+ ATPases. Additionally, we found that SCC elements are part of a broader family of mobile elements, all of which encode a replication initiator upstream of their recombinases. Replication after excision would enhance the efficiency of horizontal gene transfer.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Mir-Sanchis","full_name":"Mir-Sanchis I","initials":"I"},{"last_name":"Roman","full_name":"Roman CA","initials":"CA"},{"last_name":"Misiura","full_name":"Misiura A","initials":"A"},{"last_name":"Pigli","full_name":"Pigli YZ","initials":"YZ"},{"last_name":"Boyle-Vavra","full_name":"Boyle-Vavra S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Rice","full_name":"Rice PA","initials":"PA"}],"title":"Staphylococcal SCCmec elements encode an active MCM-like helicase and thus may be replicative.","pubmed_id":"27571176","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1038/nsmb.3286"}]}
