In the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-bound structure, we pinpoint the key residues for the peroxidatic reduction of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and relate this to mutational assays showing that the conserved active-site residues T107 and R278 are critical for effective H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> reduction. Furthermore, we propose an allosteric mode of structural change, whereby a localized conformational change arising from H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced intramolecular disulfide formation drives a structural shift at the dimerization interface of OxyR, leading to overall changes in quaternary structure and an altered DNA-binding topology and affinity at the catalase promoter region. This study provides molecular insights into the overall OxyR transcription mechanism regulated by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Pedre","full_name":"Pedre B","initials":"B"},{"last_name":"Young","full_name":"Young D","initials":"D"},{"last_name":"Charlier","full_name":"Charlier D","initials":"D"},{"last_name":"Mourenza","full_name":"Mourenza \u00c1","initials":"\u00c1"},{"last_name":"Rosado","full_name":"Rosado LA","initials":"LA"},{"last_name":"Marcos-Pascual","full_name":"Marcos-Pascual L","initials":"L"},{"last_name":"Wahni","full_name":"Wahni K","initials":"K"},{"last_name":"Martens","full_name":"Martens E","initials":"E"},{"last_name":"G de la Rubia","full_name":"G de la Rubia A","initials":"A"},{"last_name":"Belousov","full_name":"Belousov VV","initials":"VV"},{"last_name":"Mateos","full_name":"Mateos LM","initials":"LM"},{"last_name":"Messens","full_name":"Messens J","initials":"J"}],"pubmed_id":"30463959","type":"J"}]}
