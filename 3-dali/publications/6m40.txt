ALSV belongs to the distinct <i>Jingmenvirus</i> group within the <i>Flaviviridae</i> family with segmented RNA genomes. While segments 2 and 4 of the ALSV genome encode the VP1-VP3 proteins of unknown origin, segments 1 and 3 encode the NS2b-NS3 and NS5 proteins, which are related to <i>Flavivirus</i> nonstructural proteins, suggesting an evolutionary link between segmented and unsegmented viruses within the <i>Flaviviridae</i> family. Here, the enzymatic activity of the ALSV NS3-like helicase (NS3-Hel) was characterized and its crystal structure was determined to 2.9\u2005\u00c5 resolution. ALSV NS3-Hel exhibits an ATPase activity that is comparable to those measured for <i>Flavivirus</i> NS3 helicases. The structure of ALSV NS3-Hel exhibits an overall fold similar to those of <i>Flavivirus</i> NS3 helicases. Despite the limited amino-acid sequence identity between ALSV NS3-Hel and <i>Flavivirus</i> NS3 helicases, structural features at the ATPase active site and the RNA-binding groove remain conserved in ALSV NS3-Hel. These findings provide a structural framework for drug design and suggest the possibility of developing a broad-spectrum antiviral drug against both <i>Flavivirus</i> and <i>Jingmenvirus</i>.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Gao","full_name":"Gao X","initials":"X"},{"last_name":"Zhu","full_name":"Zhu K","initials":"K"},{"last_name":"Wojdyla","full_name":"Wojdyla JA","initials":"JA"},{"last_name":"Chen","full_name":"Chen P","initials":"P"},{"last_name":"Qin","full_name":"Qin B","initials":"B"},{"last_name":"Li","full_name":"Li Z","initials":"Z"},{"last_name":"Wang","full_name":"Wang M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Cui","full_name":"Cui S","initials":"S"}],"pubmed_id":"32431821","type":"J"}]}
