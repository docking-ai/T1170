We present cryo-EM studies of the <i>E. coli</i> enzyme that show how asymmetric hexameric rings of ClpX bind symmetric heptameric rings of ClpP and interact with protein substrates. Subunits in the ClpX hexamer assume a spiral conformation and interact with two-residue segments of substrate in the axial channel, as observed for other AAA+ proteases and protein-remodeling machines. Strictly sequential models of ATP hydrolysis and a power stroke that moves two residues of the substrate per translocation step have been inferred from these structural features for other AAA+ unfoldases, but biochemical and single-molecule biophysical studies indicate that ClpXP operates by a probabilistic mechanism in which five to eight residues are translocated for each ATP hydrolyzed. We propose structure-based models that could account for the functional results.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Fei","full_name":"Fei X","initials":"X"},{"last_name":"Bell","full_name":"Bell TA","initials":"TA"},{"last_name":"Jenni","full_name":"Jenni S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Stinson","full_name":"Stinson BM","initials":"BM"},{"last_name":"Baker","full_name":"Baker TA","initials":"TA"},{"last_name":"Harrison","full_name":"Harrison SC","initials":"SC"},{"last_name":"Sauer","full_name":"Sauer RT","initials":"RT"}],"title":"Structures of the ATP-fueled ClpXP proteolytic machine bound to protein substrate.","pubmed_id":"32108573","type":"J","associated_entries":"6po1, 6po3, 6pod, 6pos, 6pp5, 6pp7, 6pp8, 6ppe","doi":"10.7554/eLife.52774"}]}
