Inhibited Rubisco undergoes conformational repair by the hexameric AAA+ chaperone Rubisco activase (Rca) in a process that is not well understood. Here, we performed a structural and mechanistic analysis of cyanobacterial Rca, a close homolog of plant Rca. In the Rca:Rubisco complex, Rca is positioned over the Rubisco catalytic site under repair and pulls the N-terminal tail of the large Rubisco subunit (RbcL) into the hexamer pore. Simultaneous displacement of the C terminus of the adjacent RbcL opens the catalytic site for inhibitor release. An alternative interaction of Rca with Rubisco is mediated by C-terminal domains that resemble the small Rubisco subunit. These domains, together with the N-terminal AAA+ hexamer, ensure that Rca is packaged with Rubisco into carboxysomes. The cyanobacterial Rca is a dual-purpose protein with functions in Rubisco repair and carboxysome organization.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Flecken","full_name":"Flecken M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Wang","full_name":"Wang H","initials":"H"},{"last_name":"Popilka","full_name":"Popilka L","initials":"L"},{"last_name":"Hartl","full_name":"Hartl FU","initials":"FU"},{"last_name":"Bracher","full_name":"Bracher A","initials":"A"},{"last_name":"Hayer-Hartl","full_name":"Hayer-Hartl M","initials":"M"}],"title":"Dual Functions of a Rubisco Activase in Metabolic Repair and Recruitment to Carboxysomes.","pubmed_id":"32979320","type":"J","associated_entries":"6has, 6z1e, 6z1f, 6z1g","doi":"10.1016/j.cell.2020.09.010"}]}
