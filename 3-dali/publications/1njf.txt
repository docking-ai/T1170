The structure of the E. coli clamp loader in a nucleotide-free state has been determined previously. We now report crystal structures of a truncated form of the isolated gamma-ATPase subunit, gamma(1-243), of the E. coli clamp loader, in nucleotide-free and bound forms. The gamma subunit adopts a defined conformation when empty, in which the nucleotide binding site is blocked. The binding of either ATPgammaS or ADP, which are shown to bind with equal affinity to gamma(1-243), induces a change in the relative orientation of the two domains such that nucleotides can be accommodated. This change would break one of the gamma:gamma interfaces seen in the empty clamp loader complex, and may represent one step in the activation process.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Podobnik","full_name":"Podobnik M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Weitze","full_name":"Weitze TF","initials":"TF"},{"last_name":"O'Donnell","full_name":"O'Donnell M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Kuriyan","full_name":"Kuriyan J","initials":"J"}],"title":"Nucleotide-induced conformational changes in an isolated Escherichia coli DNA polymerase III clamp loader subunit.","pubmed_id":"12623013","type":"J","associated_entries":"1njg","doi":"10.1016/S0969-2126(03)00027-3"}]}
