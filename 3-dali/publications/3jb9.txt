Here, we report the three-dimensional structure of a Schizosaccharomyces pombe spliceosome at 3.6-angstrom resolution, revealed by means of single-particle cryogenic electron microscopy. This spliceosome contains U2 and U5 snRNPs, NTC, NTR, U6 small nuclear RNA, and an RNA intron lariat. The atomic model includes 10,574 amino acids from 37 proteins and four RNA molecules, with a combined molecular mass of approximately 1.3 megadaltons. Spp42 (Prp8 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae), the key protein component of the U5 snRNP, forms a central scaffold and anchors the catalytic center. Both the morphology and the placement of protein components appear to have evolved to facilitate the dynamic process of pre-mRNA splicing. Our near-atomic-resolution structure of a central spliceosome provides a molecular framework for mechanistic understanding of pre-mRNA splicing.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Yan","full_name":"Yan C","initials":"C"},{"last_name":"Hang","full_name":"Hang J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Wan","full_name":"Wan R","initials":"R"},{"last_name":"Huang","full_name":"Huang M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Wong","full_name":"Wong CC","initials":"CC"},{"last_name":"Shi","full_name":"Shi Y","initials":"Y"}],"pubmed_id":"26292707","type":"J"}]}
