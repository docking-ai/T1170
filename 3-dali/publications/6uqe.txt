The ClpA double-ring hexamer powers substrate unfolding and translocation into the ClpP proteolytic chamber. Here, we determined high-resolution structures of wild-type Escherichia coli ClpAP undergoing active substrate unfolding and proteolysis. A spiral of pore loop-substrate contacts spans both ClpA AAA+ domains. Protomers at the spiral seam undergo nucleotide-specific rearrangements, supporting substrate translocation. IGL loops extend flexibly to bind the planar, heptameric ClpP surface with the empty, symmetry-mismatched IGL pocket maintained at the seam. Three different structures identify a binding-pocket switch by the IGL loop of the lowest positioned protomer, involving release and re-engagement with the clockwise pocket. This switch is coupled to a ClpA rotation and a network of conformational changes across the seam, suggesting that ClpA can rotate around the ClpP apical surface during processive steps of translocation and proteolysis.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Lopez","full_name":"Lopez KE","initials":"KE"},{"last_name":"Rizo","full_name":"Rizo AN","initials":"AN"},{"last_name":"Tse","full_name":"Tse E","initials":"E"},{"last_name":"Lin","full_name":"Lin J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Scull","full_name":"Scull NW","initials":"NW"},{"last_name":"Thwin","full_name":"Thwin AC","initials":"AC"},{"last_name":"Lucius","full_name":"Lucius AL","initials":"AL"},{"last_name":"Shorter","full_name":"Shorter J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Southworth","full_name":"Southworth DR","initials":"DR"}],"title":"Conformational plasticity of the ClpAP AAA+ protease couples protein unfolding and proteolysis.","pubmed_id":"32313240","type":"J","associated_entries":"6uqo, 6w1z, 6w20, 6w21, 6w22, 6w23, 6w24","doi":"10.1038/s41594-020-0409-5"}]}
