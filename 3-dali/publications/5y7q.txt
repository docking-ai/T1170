FANCD2-FANCI-associated nuclease (FAN1) is a conserved structure-specific nuclease that unhooks DNA ICLs independently of the Fanconi anemia pathway. Recent structural studies have proposed two different mechanistic features for ICL unhooking by human FAN1: a specific basic pocket that recognizes the terminal phosphate of a 1-nucleotide (nt) 5' flap or FAN1 dimerization. Herein, we show that despite lacking these features, <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> FAN1 (<i>Pa</i>FAN1) cleaves substrates at \u223c3-nt intervals and resolves ICLs. Crystal structures of <i>Pa</i>FAN1 bound to various DNA substrates revealed that its conserved basic Arg/Lys patch comprising Arg-228 and Lys-260 recognizes phosphate groups near the 5' terminus of a DNA substrate with a 1-nt flap or a nick. Substitution of Lys-260 did not affect <i>Pa</i>FAN1's initial endonuclease activity but significantly decreased its subsequent exonuclease activity and ICL unhooking. The Arg/Lys patch also interacted with phosphates at a 3-nt gap, and this interaction could drive movement of the scissile phosphates into the <i>Pa</i>FAN1-active site. In human FAN1, the ICL-resolving activity was not affected by individual disruption of the Arg/Lys patch or basic pocket. However, simultaneous substitution of both FAN1 regions significantly reduced its ICL-resolving activity, suggesting that these two basic regions play a complementary role in ICL repair. On the basis of these findings, we propose a conserved role for two basic regions in FAN1 to guide ICL unhooking and to maintain genomic stability.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Jin","full_name":"Jin H","initials":"H"},{"last_name":"Roy","full_name":"Roy U","initials":"U"},{"last_name":"Lee","full_name":"Lee G","initials":"G"},{"last_name":"Sch\u00e4rer","full_name":"Sch\u00e4rer OD","initials":"OD"},{"last_name":"Cho","full_name":"Cho Y","initials":"Y"}],"title":"Structural mechanism of DNA interstrand cross-link unhooking by the bacterial FAN1 nuclease.","pubmed_id":"29514982","type":"J","associated_entries":"5y7g, 5z6w","doi":"10.1074/jbc.RA118.002171"}]}
