To elucidate the functional implication of the \u03b2-wing, we solved the crystal structure of apo-drZ\u03b1PKZ . Structural comparison with its Z-DNA-bound form revealed a large conformational change within the \u03b2-wing during Z-DNA binding. Biochemical studies of protein mutants revealed that two basic residues in the \u03b2-wing are responsible for Z-DNA recognition as well as fast B-Z transition. Therefore, the extra basic residues in the \u03b2-wing of drZ\u03b1PKZ are necessary for the fast B-Z transition activity.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Subramani","full_name":"Subramani VK","initials":"VK"},{"last_name":"Kim","full_name":"Kim D","initials":"D"},{"last_name":"Yun","full_name":"Yun K","initials":"K"},{"last_name":"Kim","full_name":"Kim KK","initials":"KK"}],"title":"Structural and functional studies of a large winged Z-DNA-binding domain of Danio rerio protein kinase PKZ.","pubmed_id":"27265117","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1002/1873-3468.12238"}]}
