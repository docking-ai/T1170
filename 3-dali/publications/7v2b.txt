Moreover, transcription from P<sub>vpsL</sub>, a promoter of biofilm biosynthesis, has been documented in presence of \u03c3<sub>70</sub>-RNAP/VpsR/c-di-GMP complex. It was proposed that c-di-GMP and VpsR together form an active transcription complex with \u03c3<sub>70</sub>-RNAP. However, the impact of c-di-GMP imparted on VpsR that leads to transcription activation with \u03c3<sub>70</sub>-RNAP remained elusive, largely due to the lack of the structure of VpsR and knowledge about c-di-GMP:VpsR interactions. In this direction we have solved the crystal structure of VpsR<sub>RA</sub>, containing REC and AAA<sub>+</sub> domains, in apo, AMPPNP/GMPPNP and c-di-GMP bound states. Structures of VpsR<sub>RA</sub> unveiled distinctive REC domain orientation that leads to a novel dimeric association and noncanonical ATP/GTP binding. Moreover, we have demonstrated that at physiological pH VpsR remains as monomer having no ATPase activity but c-di-GMP imparted cooperativity to convert it to dimer with potent activity. Crystal structure of c-di-GMP:VpsR<sub>RA</sub> complex reveals that c-di-GMP binds near the C-terminal end of AAA<sub>+</sub> domain. Trp quenching studies on VpsR<sub>R</sub>, VpsR<sub>A</sub>, VpsR<sub>RA</sub>, VpsR<sub>AD</sub> with c-di-GMP additionally demonstrated that c-di-GMP could potentially bind VpsR<sub>D</sub>. We propose that c-di-GMP mediated tethering of VpsR<sub>D</sub> with VpsR<sub>A</sub> could likely favor generating the specific protein-DNA architecture for transcription activation.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Chakrabortty","full_name":"Chakrabortty T","initials":"T"},{"last_name":"Roy Chowdhury","full_name":"Roy Chowdhury S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Ghosh","full_name":"Ghosh B","initials":"B"},{"last_name":"Sen","full_name":"Sen U","initials":"U"}],"pubmed_id":"34774564","type":"J"}]}
