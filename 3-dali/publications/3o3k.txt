AF1382 was selected as a structural genomics target by the Southeast Collaboratory for Structural Genomics (SECSG) since sequence analyses showed that it did not belong to the Pfam-A database and thus could represent a novel fold. The structure was determined by exploiting longer wavelength X-rays and data redundancy to increase the anomalous signal in the data. AF1382 is a 95-residue protein containing five S atoms associated with four methionine residues and a single cysteine residue that yields a calculated Bijvoet ratio (\u0394F(anom)/F) of 1.39% for 1.9\u2005\u00c5 wavelength X-rays. Coupled with an average Bijvoet redundancy of 25 (two 360\u00b0 data sets), this produced an excellent electron-density map that allowed 69 of the 95 residues to be automatically fitted. The S-SAD model was then manually completed and refined (R = 23.2%, R(free) = 26.8%) to 2.3\u2005\u00c5 resolution (PDB entry 3o3k). High-resolution data were subsequently collected from a better diffracting crystal using 0.97\u2005\u00c5 wavelength synchrotron X-rays and the S-SAD model was refined (R = 17.9%, R(free) = 21.4%) to 1.85\u2005\u00c5 resolution (PDB entry 3ov8). AF1382 has a winged-helix-turn-helix structure common to many DNA-binding proteins and most closely resembles the N-terminal domain (residues 1-82) of the Rio2 kinase from A. fulgidus, which has been shown to bind DNA, and a number of MarR-family transcriptional regulators, suggesting a similar DNA-binding function for AF1382. The analysis also points out the advantage gained from carrying out data reduction and structure determination on-site while the crystal is still available for further data collection.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Zhu","full_name":"Zhu JY","initials":"JY"},{"last_name":"Fu","full_name":"Fu ZQ","initials":"ZQ"},{"last_name":"Chen","full_name":"Chen L","initials":"L"},{"last_name":"Xu","full_name":"Xu H","initials":"H"},{"last_name":"Chrzas","full_name":"Chrzas J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Rose","full_name":"Rose J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Wang","full_name":"Wang BC","initials":"BC"}],"title":"Structure of the Archaeoglobus fulgidus orphan ORF AF1382 determined by sulfur SAD from a moderately diffracting crystal.","pubmed_id":"22948926","type":"J","associated_entries":"3ov8","doi":"10.1107/S0907444912026212"}]}
