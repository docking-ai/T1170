Selenocysteine is coded by a UGA stop codon in combination with a specific downstream mRNA hairpin. In bacteria, the C-terminal part of SelB recognizes this hairpin, while the N-terminal part binds GTP and tRNA in analogy with elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu). We present the crystal structure of a C-terminal fragment of SelB (SelB-C) from Moorella thermoacetica at 2.12 A resolution, solved by a combination of selenium and yttrium multiwavelength anomalous dispersion. This 264 amino acid fragment contains the entire C-terminal extension beginning after the EF-Tu-homologous domains. SelB-C consists of four similar winged-helix domains arranged into the shape of an L. This is the first example of winged-helix domains involved in RNA binding. The location of conserved basic amino acids, together with data from the literature, define the position of the mRNA-binding site. Steric requirements indicate that a conformational change may occur upon ribosome interaction. Structural observations and data in the literature suggest that this change happens upon mRNA binding.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Selmer","full_name":"Selmer M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Su","full_name":"Su XD","initials":"XD"}],"title":"Crystal structure of an mRNA-binding fragment of Moorella thermoacetica elongation factor SelB.","pubmed_id":"12145214","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1093/emboj/cdf408"},{"journal_info":{"volume":"58","pdb_abbreviation":"Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr","ISO_abbreviation":"Acta Crystallogr.
