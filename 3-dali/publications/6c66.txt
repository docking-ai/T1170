Here we present a 3.7 \u00c5 resolution cryo-EM structure of the Type I-E Cascade/R-loop/Cas3 complex, poised to initiate DNA degradation. Cas3 distinguishes Cascade conformations and only captures the R-loop forming Cascade, to avoid cleaving partially complementary targets. Its nuclease domain recruits the non-target strand (NTS) DNA at a bulged region for the nicking of single-stranded DNA. An additional 4.7 \u00c5 resolution cryo-EM structure captures the post-nicking state, in which the severed NTS retracts to the helicase entrance, to be threaded for ATP-dependent processive degradation. These snapshots form the basis for understanding RNA-guided DNA degradation in Type I-E CRISPR-Cas systems.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Xiao","full_name":"Xiao Y","initials":"Y"},{"last_name":"Luo","full_name":"Luo M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Dolan","full_name":"Dolan AE","initials":"AE"},{"last_name":"Liao","full_name":"Liao M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Ke","full_name":"Ke A","initials":"A"}],"title":"Structure basis for RNA-guided DNA degradation by Cascade and Cas3.","pubmed_id":"29880725","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1126/science.aat0839"}]}
