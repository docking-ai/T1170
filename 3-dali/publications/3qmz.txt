Evolved from ring-shaped hexameric AAA-family adenosine triphosphatases (ATPases), dynein's large size and complexity have posed challenges for understanding its structure and mechanism. Here, we present a 6 angstrom crystal structure of a functional dimer of two ~300-kilodalton motor domains of yeast cytoplasmic dynein. The structure reveals an unusual asymmetric arrangement of ATPase domains in the ring-shaped motor domain, the manner in which the mechanical element interacts with the ATPase ring, and an unexpected interaction between two coiled coils that create a base for the microtubule binding domain. The arrangement of these elements provides clues as to how adenosine triphosphate-driven conformational changes might be transmitted across the motor domain.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Carter","full_name":"Carter AP","initials":"AP"},{"last_name":"Cho","full_name":"Cho C","initials":"C"},{"last_name":"Jin","full_name":"Jin L","initials":"L"},{"last_name":"Vale","full_name":"Vale RD","initials":"RD"}],"pubmed_id":"21330489","type":"J"}]}
