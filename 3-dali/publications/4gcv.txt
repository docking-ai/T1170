Here, we determined the structure of PA1374 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 2.3\u00c5 resolution. PA1374 belonged to the MarR family and its structure revealed a tightly bound dimer with each subunit containing a winged helix-turn-helix (wHTH) DNA-binding motif. Conserved arginine residues, Arg55, Arg74, and Arg77, were located in the wHTH region, which might be important to DNA binding. Furthermore, each monomer contained a pocket made of conserved hydrophobic residues. A highly conserved Cys11 located at one end of this pocket may undergo oxidation by organic hydroperoxide molecules, as shown in other MarR family proteins acting as redox-sensing regulators. These results provide insights about the role of PA1374 as a putative oxidative-stress sensing transcriptional regulator.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Kim","full_name":"Kim H","initials":"H"},{"last_name":"Choe","full_name":"Choe J","initials":"J"}],"pubmed_id":"23337505","type":"J"}]}
