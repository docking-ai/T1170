We used cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to define the mechanism that underlies this process by characterizing the transposition regulator, TnsC, from a type V-K CRISPR-transposase system. In this scenario, polymerization of adenosine triphosphate-bound TnsC helical filaments could explain how polarity information is passed to the transposase. TniQ caps the TnsC filament, representing a universal mechanism for target information transfer in Tn7/Tn7-like elements. Transposase-driven disassembly establishes delivery of the element only to unused protospacers. Finally, TnsC transitions to define the fixed point of insertion, as revealed by structures with the transition state mimic ADP\u2022AlF<sub>3</sub> These mechanistic findings provide the underpinnings for engineering CRISPR-associated transposition systems for research and therapeutic applications.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Park","full_name":"Park JU","initials":"JU"},{"last_name":"Tsai","full_name":"Tsai AW","initials":"AW"},{"last_name":"Mehrotra","full_name":"Mehrotra E","initials":"E"},{"last_name":"Petassi","full_name":"Petassi MT","initials":"MT"},{"last_name":"Hsieh","full_name":"Hsieh SC","initials":"SC"},{"last_name":"Ke","full_name":"Ke A","initials":"A"},{"last_name":"Peters","full_name":"Peters JE","initials":"JE"},{"last_name":"Kellogg","full_name":"Kellogg EH","initials":"EH"}],"pubmed_id":"34385391","type":"J"}]}
