It plays pivotal roles\u00a0in small RNA biogenesis during the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway by processing a diverse range of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) precursors to generate \u223c22 nt microRNA (miRNA) or small interfering RNA (siRNA) products for sequence-directed gene silencing. In this work, we solved the cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of hDicer in complex with its cofactor protein TRBP and revealed the precise spatial arrangement of hDicer's multiple\u00a0domains. We further solved structures of the hDicer-TRBP complex bound with pre-let-7 RNA in two distinct conformations. In combination with biochemical analysis, these structures reveal a property of the hDicer-TRBP complex to promote the stability of pre-miRNA's stem duplex in a pre-dicing state. These results provide insights into the\u00a0mechanism of RNA processing by hDicer and illustrate the regulatory role of hDicer's N-terminal helicase domain.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Liu","full_name":"Liu Z","initials":"Z"},{"last_name":"Wang","full_name":"Wang J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Cheng","full_name":"Cheng H","initials":"H"},{"last_name":"Ke","full_name":"Ke X","initials":"X"},{"last_name":"Sun","full_name":"Sun L","initials":"L"},{"last_name":"Zhang","full_name":"Zhang QC","initials":"QC"},{"last_name":"Wang","full_name":"Wang HW","initials":"HW"}],"pubmed_id":"29706542","type":"J"}]}
