Even though it was discovered more than two decades ago and has been widely used for aromatic hydrocarbon sensing, the activation mechanism of DmpR has remained elusive. Here, we show that phenol-bound DmpR forms a tetramer composed of two head-to-head dimers in a head-to-tail arrangement. The DmpR-phenol complex exhibits altered conformations within the C-termini of the sensory domains and shows an asymmetric orientation and angle in its coiled-coil linkers. The structural changes within the phenol binding sites and the downstream ATPase domains suggest that the effector binding signal is propagated through the coiled-coil helixes. The tetrameric DmpR-phenol complex interacts with the \u03c3<sub>54</sub> subunit of RNA polymerase in presence of an ATP analogue, indicating that DmpR-like bEBPs tetramers utilize a mechanistic mode distinct from that of hexameric AAA<sub>+</sub> ATPases to activate \u03c3<sub>54</sub>-dependent transcription.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Park","full_name":"Park KH","initials":"KH"},{"last_name":"Kim","full_name":"Kim S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Lee","full_name":"Lee SJ","initials":"SJ"},{"last_name":"Cho","full_name":"Cho JE","initials":"JE"},{"last_name":"Patil","full_name":"Patil VV","initials":"VV"},{"last_name":"Dumbrepatil","full_name":"Dumbrepatil AB","initials":"AB"},{"last_name":"Song","full_name":"Song HN","initials":"HN"},{"last_name":"Ahn","full_name":"Ahn WC","initials":"WC"},{"last_name":"Joo","full_name":"Joo C","initials":"C"},{"last_name":"Lee","full_name":"Lee SG","initials":"SG"},{"last_name":"Shingler","full_name":"Shingler V","initials":"V"},{"last_name":"Woo","full_name":"Woo EJ","initials":"EJ"}],"title":"Tetrameric architecture of an active phenol-bound form of the AAA<sub>+</sub> transcriptional regulator DmpR.","pubmed_id":"32483114","type":"J","associated_entries":"5fru, 5frv, 5frw, 5frx, 5fry, 5frz, 5fs0","doi":"10.1038/s41467-020-16562-5"},{"journal_info":{"volume":"24","pdb_abbreviation":"Structure","ISO_abbreviation":"Structure","year":2016,"issue":"4","pages":"624-30"},"abstract":{"methods":null,"conclusions":null,"results":null,"unassigned":"Positive phenol-degradative gene regulator (PoxR) is a \u03c3(54)-dependent AAA+ ATPase transcription activator that regulates the catabolism of phenols. The PoxR sensory domain detects phenols and relays signals for the activation of transcription. Here we report the first structure of the phenol sensory domain bound to phenol and five derivatives. It exists as a tightly intertwined homodimer with a phenol-binding pocket buried inside, placing two C termini on the same side of the dimer. His102 and Trp130 interact with the hydroxyl group of the phenol in a cavity surrounded by rigid hydrophobic residues on one side and a flexible region on the other. Each monomer has a V4R fold with a unique zinc-binding site. A shift at the C-terminal helix suggests that there is a possible conformational change upon ligand binding.
