Dynein's unusually large size, four distinct nucleotide-binding sites, and conformational dynamics pose challenges for the design of potent and selective chemical inhibitors. Here we use structural approaches to develop a model for the inhibition of a well-characterized S.\u00a0cerevisiae dynein construct by pyrazolo-pyrimidinone-based compounds. These data, along with functional assays of dynein motility and mutagenesis studies, suggest that the compounds inhibit dynein by engaging the regulatory ATPase sites in the AAA3 and AAA4 domains, and not by interacting with dynein's main catalytic site in the AAA1 domain. A double Walker B mutation of the AAA3 and AAA4 sites substantially reduces enzyme activity, suggesting that targeting these regulatory domains is sufficient to inhibit dynein. Our findings reveal how chemical inhibitors can be designed to disrupt allosteric communication across dynein's AAA domains.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Santarossa","full_name":"Santarossa CC","initials":"CC"},{"last_name":"Mickolajczyk","full_name":"Mickolajczyk KJ","initials":"KJ"},{"last_name":"Steinman","full_name":"Steinman JB","initials":"JB"},{"last_name":"Urnavicius","full_name":"Urnavicius L","initials":"L"},{"last_name":"Chen","full_name":"Chen N","initials":"N"},{"last_name":"Hirata","full_name":"Hirata Y","initials":"Y"},{"last_name":"Fukase","full_name":"Fukase Y","initials":"Y"},{"last_name":"Coudray","full_name":"Coudray N","initials":"N"},{"last_name":"Ekiert","full_name":"Ekiert DC","initials":"DC"},{"last_name":"Bhabha","full_name":"Bhabha G","initials":"G"},{"last_name":"Kapoor","full_name":"Kapoor TM","initials":"TM"}],"title":"Targeting allostery in the Dynein motor domain with small molecule inhibitors.","pubmed_id":"34015309","type":"J","associated_entries":"7mi1, 7mi3, 7mi8","doi":"10.1016/j.chembiol.2021.04.024"}]}
