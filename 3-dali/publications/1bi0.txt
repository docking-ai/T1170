DtxR consists of two 25.3-kDa three-domain subunits and is a member of a family of related repressor proteins in several Gram-positive bacterial species, some of which are important human pathogens. In this paper, we report on the first high resolution crystal structures of apo-DtxR in two related space groups. In addition, crystal structures of Zn-DtxR were determined in the same two space groups. The resolutions of the structures range from 2.2 to 2.4 A. The four refined models of the apo- and the holo-repressor exhibit quite similar metal binding centers, which do, however, show higher thermal motion in the apo-structures. All four structures reported differ from each other in one important aspect. The N-terminal DNA-binding domain and the last 20 residues of the dimerization domain of each subunit move significantly with respect to the core of the DtxR dimer, which consists of residues 74-120 from both subunits. These results provide the first indication of a conformational change that may occur upon binding of the holo-repressor to DNA.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Pohl","full_name":"Pohl E","initials":"E"},{"last_name":"Holmes","full_name":"Holmes RK","initials":"RK"},{"last_name":"Hol","full_name":"Hol WG","initials":"WG"}],"title":"Motion of the DNA-binding domain with respect to the core of the diphtheria toxin repressor (DtxR) revealed in the crystal structures of apo- and holo-DtxR.","pubmed_id":"9712865","type":"J","associated_entries":"1bi1, 1bi2, 1bi3","doi":"10.1074/jbc.273.35.22420"},{"journal_info":{"volume":"3","pdb_abbreviation":"Structure","ISO_abbreviation":"Structure","year":1995,"issue":"1","pages":"87-100"},"abstract":{"methods":null,"conclusions":"The crystal structure of the DtxR holorepressor suggests that the divalent cation co-repressor controls motions of the DNA-binding domain.

Each DNA-binding domain contains a helix-turn-helix motif and has a topology which is very similar to catabolite gene activator protein (CAP). Molecular modeling suggests that bound DNA adopts a bent conformation with helices alpha 3 of DtxR interacting with the major grooves. The two metal-binding sites lie approximately 10 A apart. Binding site 2 is positioned at a potential hinge region between the DNA-binding and interface domains. Residues 98-108 appear to be crucial for the functioning of the repressor; these provide four of the ligands of the two metal-binding sites and three residues at the other side of the helix which are at the heart of the dimer interface.","unassigned":null,"background":"When Corynebacterium diphtheriae encounters an environment with a low concentration of iron ions, it initiates the synthesis of several virulence factors, including diphtheria toxin.

DtxR protected a sequence of approximately 30 nucleotide pairs, partially overlapping the tox promoter and containing a region of dyad symmetry, from digestion by DNase I.
