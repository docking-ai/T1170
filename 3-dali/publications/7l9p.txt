The AAA<sub>+</sub> ATPase TRIP13 remodels Shieldin to regulate DNA repair pathway choice. Here we report crystal structures of human SHLD3-REV7 binary and fused SHLD2-SHLD3-REV7 ternary complexes, revealing that assembly of Shieldin requires fused SHLD2-SHLD3 induced conformational heterodimerization of open (O-REV7) and closed (C-REV7) forms of REV7. We also report the cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of the ATP\u03b3S-bound fused SHLD2-SHLD3-REV7-TRIP13 complexes, uncovering the principles underlying the TRIP13-mediated disassembly mechanism of the Shieldin complex. We demonstrate that the N terminus of REV7 inserts into the central channel of TRIP13, setting the stage for pulling the unfolded N-terminal peptide of C-REV7 through the central TRIP13 hexameric channel. The primary interface involves contacts between the safety-belt segment of C-REV7 and a conserved and negatively charged loop of TRIP13. This process is mediated by ATP hydrolysis-triggered rotatory motions of the TRIP13 ATPase, thereby resulting in the disassembly of the Shieldin complex.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Xie","full_name":"Xie W","initials":"W"},{"last_name":"Wang","full_name":"Wang S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Wang","full_name":"Wang J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"de la Cruz","full_name":"de la Cruz MJ","initials":"MJ"},{"last_name":"Xu","full_name":"Xu G","initials":"G"},{"last_name":"Scaltriti","full_name":"Scaltriti M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Patel","full_name":"Patel DJ","initials":"DJ"}],"title":"Molecular mechanisms of assembly and TRIP13-mediated remodeling of the human Shieldin complex.","pubmed_id":"33597306","type":"J","associated_entries":"6ww9, 6wwa","doi":"10.1073/pnas.2024512118"}]}
