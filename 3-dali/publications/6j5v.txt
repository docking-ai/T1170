The <i>Xanthomonas campestris</i> pv. <i>campestris</i> effector AvrAC uridylylates the <i>Arabidopsis</i> PBL2 kinase, and the latter (PBL2<sub>UMP</sub>) acts as a ligand to activate the NLR ZAR1 precomplexed with the RKS1 pseudokinase. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structures of ZAR1-RKS1 and ZAR1-RKS1-PBL2<sub>UMP</sub> in an inactive and intermediate state, respectively. The ZAR1<sub>LRR</sub> domain, compared with animal NLR<sub>LRR</sub> domains, is differently positioned to sequester ZAR1 in an inactive state. Recognition of PBL2<sub>UMP</sub> is exclusively through RKS1, which interacts with ZAR1<sub>LRR</sub> PBL2<sub>UMP</sub> binding stabilizes the RKS1 activation segment, which sterically blocks ZAR1 adenosine diphosphate (ADP) binding. This engenders a more flexible NB domain without conformational changes in the other ZAR1 domains. Our study provides a structural template for understanding plant NLRs.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Wang","full_name":"Wang J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Wang","full_name":"Wang J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Hu","full_name":"Hu M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Wu","full_name":"Wu S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Qi","full_name":"Qi J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Wang","full_name":"Wang G","initials":"G"},{"last_name":"Han","full_name":"Han Z","initials":"Z"},{"last_name":"Qi","full_name":"Qi Y","initials":"Y"},{"last_name":"Gao","full_name":"Gao N","initials":"N"},{"last_name":"Wang","full_name":"Wang HW","initials":"HW"},{"last_name":"Zhou","full_name":"Zhou JM","initials":"JM"},{"last_name":"Chai","full_name":"Chai J","initials":"J"}],"title":"Ligand-triggered allosteric ADP release primes a plant NLR complex.","pubmed_id":"30948526","type":"J","associated_entries":"6j5u, 6j5w","doi":"10.1126/science.aav5868"}]}
