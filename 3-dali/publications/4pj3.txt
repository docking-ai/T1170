Here we report the crystal structure of human Aquarius, revealing a central RNA helicase core and several unique accessory domains, including an ARM-repeat domain. We show that Aquarius is integrated into spliceosomes as part of a pentameric intron-binding complex (IBC) that, together with the ARM domain, cross-links to U2 snRNP proteins within activated spliceosomes; this suggests that the latter aid in positioning Aquarius on the intron. Aquarius's ARM domain is essential for IBC formation, thus indicating that it has a key protein-protein-scaffolding role. Finally, we provide evidence that Aquarius is required for efficient precursor-mRNA splicing in vitro. Our findings highlight the remarkable structural adaptations of a helicase to achieve position-specific recruitment to a ribonucleoprotein complex and reveal a new building block of the human spliceosome.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"De","full_name":"De I","initials":"I"},{"last_name":"Bessonov","full_name":"Bessonov S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Hofele","full_name":"Hofele R","initials":"R"},{"last_name":"Dos Santos","full_name":"Dos Santos K","initials":"K"},{"last_name":"Will","full_name":"Will CL","initials":"CL"},{"last_name":"Urlaub","full_name":"Urlaub H","initials":"H"},{"last_name":"L\u00fchrmann","full_name":"L\u00fchrmann R","initials":"R"},{"last_name":"Pena","full_name":"Pena V","initials":"V"}],"pubmed_id":"25599396","type":"J"}]}
