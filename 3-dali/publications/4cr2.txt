The molecular architecture of the 26S proteasome was recently established by cryo-EM approaches. For a detailed understanding of the sequence of events from the initial binding of polyubiquitylated substrates to the translocation into the proteolytic core complex, it is necessary to move beyond static structures and characterize the conformational landscape of the 26S proteasome. To this end we have subjected a large cryo-EM dataset acquired in the presence of ATP and ATP-\u03b3S to a deep classification procedure, which deconvolutes coexisting conformational states. Highly variable regions, such as the density assigned to the largest subunit, Rpn1, are now well resolved and rendered interpretable. Our analysis reveals the existence of three major conformations: in addition to the previously described ATP-hydrolyzing (ATPh) and ATP-\u03b3S conformations, an intermediate state has been found. Its AAA-ATPase module adopts essentially the same topology that is observed in the ATPh conformation, whereas the lid is more similar to the ATP-\u03b3S bound state. Based on the conformational ensemble of the 26S proteasome in solution, we propose a mechanistic model for substrate recognition, commitment, deubiquitylation, and translocation into the core particle.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Unverdorben","full_name":"Unverdorben P","initials":"P"},{"last_name":"Beck","full_name":"Beck F","initials":"F"},{"last_name":"Sled\u017a","full_name":"Sled\u017a P","initials":"P"},{"last_name":"Schweitzer","full_name":"Schweitzer A","initials":"A"},{"last_name":"Pfeifer","full_name":"Pfeifer G","initials":"G"},{"last_name":"Plitzko","full_name":"Plitzko JM","initials":"JM"},{"last_name":"Baumeister","full_name":"Baumeister W","initials":"W"},{"last_name":"F\u00f6rster","full_name":"F\u00f6rster F","initials":"F"}],"pubmed_id":"24706844","type":"J"}]}
