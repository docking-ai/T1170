The hexamer of Brucella suis VirB11 (BsB11), like that of the Helicobacter pylori VirB11 (Hp0525), consists of a double ring structure formed by the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of each monomer. However, the monomer differs dramatically from that of Hp0525 by a large domain swap that leaves the hexameric assembly intact but profoundly alters the nucleotide-binding site and the interface between subunits.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Hare","full_name":"Hare S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Bayliss","full_name":"Bayliss R","initials":"R"},{"last_name":"Baron","full_name":"Baron C","initials":"C"},{"last_name":"Waksman","full_name":"Waksman G","initials":"G"}],"title":"A large domain swap in the VirB11 ATPase of Brucella suis leaves the hexameric assembly intact.","pubmed_id":"16730027","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1016/j.jmb.2006.04.060"}]}
