Understanding the mechanism of PafBC activation is impeded by a lack of structural information on this transcription factor that contains a widespread, but poorly understood WYL domain frequently encountered in bacterial transcription factors. Here, we determine the crystal structure of Arthrobacter aurescens PafBC. The protein consists of two modules, each harboring an N-terminal helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain followed by a central WYL and a C-terminal extension (WCX) domain. The WYL domains exhibit Sm-folds, while the WCX domains adopt ferredoxin-like folds, both characteristic for RNA-binding proteins. Our results suggest a mechanism of regulation in which WYL domain-containing transcription factors may be activated by binding RNA or other nucleic acid molecules. Using an in vivo mutational screen in Mycobacterium smegmatis, we identify potential co-activator binding sites on PafBC.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"M\u00fcller","full_name":"M\u00fcller AU","initials":"AU"},{"last_name":"Leibundgut","full_name":"Leibundgut M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Ban","full_name":"Ban N","initials":"N"},{"last_name":"Weber-Ban","full_name":"Weber-Ban E","initials":"E"}],"title":"Structure and functional implications of WYL domain-containing bacterial DNA damage response regulator PafBC.","pubmed_id":"31604936","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1038/s41467-019-12567-x"}]}
