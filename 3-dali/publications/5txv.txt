Here, we use genetic-tethering and disulfide-bonding strategies to construct HslU pseudohexamers containing mixtures of ATPase active and inactive subunits at defined positions in the hexameric ring. Genetic tethering impairs HslV binding and degradation, even for pseudohexamers with six active subunits, but disulfide-linked pseudohexamers do not have these defects, indicating that the peptide tether interferes with HslV interactions. Importantly, pseudohexamers containing different patterns of hydrolytically active and inactive subunits retain the ability to unfold protein substrates and/or collaborate with HslV in their degradation, supporting a model in which ATP hydrolysis and linked mechanical function in the HslU ring operate by a probabilistic mechanism.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Baytshtok","full_name":"Baytshtok V","initials":"V"},{"last_name":"Chen","full_name":"Chen J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Glynn","full_name":"Glynn SE","initials":"SE"},{"last_name":"Nager","full_name":"Nager AR","initials":"AR"},{"last_name":"Grant","full_name":"Grant RA","initials":"RA"},{"last_name":"Baker","full_name":"Baker TA","initials":"TA"},{"last_name":"Sauer","full_name":"Sauer RT","initials":"RT"}],"pubmed_id":"28223361","type":"J"}]}
