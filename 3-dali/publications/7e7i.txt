Mutations in human ABCA transporters have been described to cause severe hereditary disorders associated with impaired lipid transport. However, little is known about the mechanistic details of substrate recognition and translocation by ABCA transporters. Here, we present three cryo-EM structures of human ABCA4, a retina-specific ABCA transporter, in distinct functional states at resolutions of 3.3-3.4 \u00c5. In the nucleotide-free state, the two transmembrane domains (TMDs) exhibit a lateral-opening conformation, allowing the lateral entry of substrate from the lipid bilayer. The N-retinylidene-phosphatidylethanolamine (NRPE), the physiological lipid substrate of ABCA4, is sandwiched between the two TMDs in the luminal leaflet and is further stabilized by an extended loop from extracellular domain 1. In the ATP-bound state, the two TMDs display a closed conformation, which precludes the substrate binding. Our study provides a molecular basis to understand the mechanism of ABCA4-mediated NRPE recognition and translocation, and suggests a common 'lateral access and extrusion' mechanism for ABCA-mediated lipid transport.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Xie","full_name":"Xie T","initials":"T"},{"last_name":"Zhang","full_name":"Zhang Z","initials":"Z"},{"last_name":"Fang","full_name":"Fang Q","initials":"Q"},{"last_name":"Du","full_name":"Du B","initials":"B"},{"last_name":"Gong","full_name":"Gong X","initials":"X"}],"pubmed_id":"34158497","type":"J"}]}
