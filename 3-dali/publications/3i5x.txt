Here we determined high-resolution X-ray crystal structures of Mss116p complexed with an RNA oligonucleotide and ATP analogs AMP-PNP, ADP-BeF(3)(-), or ADP-AlF(4)(-). The structures show the entire helicase core acting together with a functionally important C-terminal extension. In all structures, the helicase core is in a closed conformation with a wedge alpha helix bending RNA 3' of the central bound nucleotides, as in previous DEAD box protein structures. Notably, Mss116p's C-terminal extension also bends RNA 5' of the central nucleotides, resulting in RNA crimping. Despite reported functional differences, we observe few structural changes in ternary complexes with different ATP analogs. The structures constrain models of DEAD box protein function and reveal a strand separation mechanism in which a protein uses two wedges to act as a molecular crimper.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Del Campo","full_name":"Del Campo M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Lambowitz","full_name":"Lambowitz AM","initials":"AM"}],"title":"Structure of the Yeast DEAD box protein Mss116p reveals two wedges that crimp RNA.","pubmed_id":"19748356","type":"J","associated_entries":"3i5y, 3i61, 3i62","doi":"10.1016/j.molcel.2009.07.032"},{"journal_info":{"volume":"65","pdb_abbreviation":"Acta Crystallogr.

For crystallization trials, full-length Mss116p and a C-terminally truncated protein (Mss116p/Delta598-664) were overproduced in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. Mss116p exhibited low solubility in standard solutions (< or =1 mg ml(-1)), but its solubility could be increased by adding 50 mM L-arginine plus 50 mM L-glutamate and 50% glycerol to achieve concentrations of approximately 10 mg ml(-1). Initial crystals were obtained by the microbatch method in the presence of a U(10) RNA oligonucleotide and the ATP analog AMP-PNP and were then improved by using seeding and sitting-drop vapor diffusion. A cryocooled crystal of Mss116p/Delta598-664 in complex with AMP-PNP and U(10) belonged to space group P2(1)2(1)2, with unit-cell parameters a = 88.54, b = 126.52, c = 55.52 A, and diffracted X-rays to beyond 1.9 A resolution using synchrotron radiation from sector 21 at the Advanced Photon Source.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Del Campo","full_name":"Del Campo M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Lambowitz","full_name":"Lambowitz AM","initials":"AM"}],"title":"Crystallization and preliminary X-ray diffraction of the DEAD-box protein Mss116p complexed with an RNA oligonucleotide and AMP-PNP.","pubmed_id":"19652352","type":"J","associated_entries":"3i5y, 3i61, 3i62","doi":"10.1107/S1744309109027225"}]}
