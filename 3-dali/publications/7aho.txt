RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 AAA-ATPases form an hetero-hexameric ring that is part of several macromolecular complexes such as INO80, SWR1 and R2TP. Interestingly, RUVBL1-RUVBL2 ATPase activity is required for NMD activation by an unknown mechanism. Here, we show that DHX34, an RNA helicase regulating NMD initiation, directly interacts with RUVBL1-RUVBL2 <i>in vitro</i> and in cells. Cryo-EM reveals that DHX34 induces extensive changes in the N-termini of every RUVBL2 subunit in the complex, stabilizing a conformation that does not bind nucleotide and thereby down-regulates ATP hydrolysis of the complex. Using ATPase-deficient mutants, we find that DHX34 acts exclusively on the RUVBL2 subunits. We propose a model, where DHX34 acts to couple RUVBL1-RUVBL2 ATPase activity to the assembly of factors required to initiate the NMD response.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"L\u00f3pez-Perrote","full_name":"L\u00f3pez-Perrote A","initials":"A"},{"last_name":"Hug","full_name":"Hug N","initials":"N"},{"last_name":"Gonz\u00e1lez-Corpas","full_name":"Gonz\u00e1lez-Corpas A","initials":"A"},{"last_name":"Rodr\u00edguez","full_name":"Rodr\u00edguez CF","initials":"CF"},{"last_name":"Serna","full_name":"Serna M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Garc\u00eda-Mart\u00edn","full_name":"Garc\u00eda-Mart\u00edn C","initials":"C"},{"last_name":"Boskovic","full_name":"Boskovic J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Fernandez-Leiro","full_name":"Fernandez-Leiro R","initials":"R"},{"last_name":"Caceres","full_name":"Caceres JF","initials":"JF"},{"last_name":"Llorca","full_name":"Llorca O","initials":"O"}],"title":"Regulation of RUVBL1-RUVBL2 AAA-ATPases by the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay factor DHX34, as evidenced by Cryo-EM.","pubmed_id":"33205750","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.7554/eLife.63042"}]}
