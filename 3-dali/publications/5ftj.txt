Here, we report cryo-EM structures for ADP-bound, full-length, hexameric wild-type p97 in the presence and absence of an allosteric inhibitor at resolutions of 2.3 \u00c5 and 2.4 \u00c5, respectively. We also report cryo-EM structures at ~ 3.3 \u00c5, 3.2 \u00c5 and 3.3 \u00c5 resolutions respectively, for three distinct, co-existing functional states of p97 with occupancies of 0, 1 or 2 molecules of ATP\u03b3S per protomer. A large corkscrew-like change in molecular architecture coupled with upward displacement of the N-domain is observed only when ATP\u03b3S is bound to both D1 and D2 domains. These cryo-EM structures establish the sequence of nucleotide-driven structural changes in p97 at atomic resolution. They also enable elucidation of the binding mode of an allosteric small molecule inhibitor to p97 and illustrate how inhibitor binding at the interface between D1 and D2 domains prevents propagation of the conformational changes necessary for p97 function.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Banerjee","full_name":"Banerjee S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Bartesaghi","full_name":"Bartesaghi A","initials":"A"},{"last_name":"Merk","full_name":"Merk A","initials":"A"},{"last_name":"Rao","full_name":"Rao P","initials":"P"},{"last_name":"Bulfer","full_name":"Bulfer SL","initials":"SL"},{"last_name":"Yan","full_name":"Yan Y","initials":"Y"},{"last_name":"Green","full_name":"Green N","initials":"N"},{"last_name":"Mroczkowski","full_name":"Mroczkowski B","initials":"B"},{"last_name":"Neitz","full_name":"Neitz RJ","initials":"RJ"},{"last_name":"Wipf","full_name":"Wipf P","initials":"P"},{"last_name":"Falconieri","full_name":"Falconieri V","initials":"V"},{"last_name":"Deshaies","full_name":"Deshaies RJ","initials":"RJ"},{"last_name":"Milne","full_name":"Milne JL","initials":"JL"},{"last_name":"Huryn","full_name":"Huryn D","initials":"D"},{"last_name":"Arkin","full_name":"Arkin M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Subramaniam","full_name":"Subramaniam S","initials":"S"}],"title":"2.3 \u00c5 resolution cryo-EM structure of human p97 and mechanism of allosteric inhibition.","pubmed_id":"26822609","type":"J","associated_entries":"5ftk, 5ftl, 5ftm, 5ftn","doi":"10.1126/science.aad7974"}]}
