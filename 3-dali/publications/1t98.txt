MukB is an ATPase and DNA-binding protein of the SMC superfamily; however, the structure and function of non-SMC components, such as MukF, have been less forthcoming. Here, we report the crystal structure of the N-terminal 287 amino acids of MukF at 2.9 A resolution. This region folds into a winged-helix domain and an extended coiled-coil domain that self-associate to form a stable, doubly domain-swapped dimer. Protein dissection and affinity purification data demonstrate that the region of MukF C-terminal to this fragment binds to MukE and MukB. Our findings, together with sequence analyses, indicate that MukF is a kleisin subunit for E. coli condensin and suggest a means by which it may organize the MukBEF assembly.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Fennell-Fezzie","full_name":"Fennell-Fezzie R","initials":"R"},{"last_name":"Gradia","full_name":"Gradia SD","initials":"SD"},{"last_name":"Akey","full_name":"Akey D","initials":"D"},{"last_name":"Berger","full_name":"Berger JM","initials":"JM"}],"pubmed_id":"15902272","type":"J"}]}
