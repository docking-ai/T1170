The PagR protein sequence is similar to those of members of the ArsR repressor family involved in the repression of arsenate-resistance genes in numerous bacteria. The crystal structure of PagR was solved using multi-wavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) techniques and was refined with 1.8 A resolution diffraction data. The PagR molecules form dimers, as observed in all SmtB/ArsR repressor family proteins. In the crystal lattice four PagR dimers pack together to form an inactive octamer. Model-building studies suggest that the dimer binds to a DNA duplex with a bend of around 4 degrees.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Zhao","full_name":"Zhao H","initials":"H"},{"last_name":"Volkov","full_name":"Volkov A","initials":"A"},{"last_name":"Veldore","full_name":"Veldore VH","initials":"VH"},{"last_name":"Hoch","full_name":"Hoch JA","initials":"JA"},{"last_name":"Varughese","full_name":"Varughese KI","initials":"KI"}],"title":"Crystal structure of the transcriptional repressor PagR of Bacillus anthracis.","pubmed_id":"19926656","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1099/mic.0.033548-0"}]}
