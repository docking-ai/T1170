The FtsH protein is divided into the N-terminal transmembrane region and the larger C-terminal cytoplasmic region, which consists of an ATPase domain and a protease domain. We have determined the crystal structures of the Thermus thermophilus FtsH ATPase domain in the nucleotide-free and AMP-PNP- and ADP-bound states, in addition to the domain with the extra preceding segment. Combined with the mapping of the putative substrate binding region, these structures suggest that FtsH internally forms a hexameric ring structure, in which ATP binding could cause a conformational change to facilitate transport of substrates into the protease domain through the central pore.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Niwa","full_name":"Niwa H","initials":"H"},{"last_name":"Tsuchiya","full_name":"Tsuchiya D","initials":"D"},{"last_name":"Makyio","full_name":"Makyio H","initials":"H"},{"last_name":"Yoshida","full_name":"Yoshida M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Morikawa","full_name":"Morikawa K","initials":"K"}],"title":"Hexameric ring structure of the ATPase domain of the membrane-integrated metalloprotease FtsH from Thermus thermophilus HB8.","pubmed_id":"12377127","type":"J","associated_entries":"1iy0, 1iy1, 1iy2","doi":"10.1016/S0969-2126(02)00855-9"}]}
