The nucleotide binds at a cleft formed by an alpha/beta domain and an alpha-helical domain in HslU. The four HslU states differ by a rotation of the alpha-helical domain. This classification leads to a correction of nucleotide identity in one structure and reveals the ATP hydrolysis-dependent structural changes in the HslVU complex, including a ring rotation and a conformational change of the HslU C terminus. This leads to an amended protein unfolding-coupled translocation mechanism.","unassigned":null,"background":"The bacterial heat shock locus ATPase HslU is an AAA(+) protein that has structures known in many nucleotide-free and -bound states.
