Here, we report four high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structures of the mycobacterial LpqY-SugABC complex to reveal how it binds and passes trehalose through the membrane to the cytoplasm. A unique feature observed in this system is the initial mode of capture of the trehalose at the LpqY interface. Uptake is achieved by a pivotal rotation of LpqY relative to SugABC, moving from an open and accessible conformation to a clamped conformation upon trehalose binding. These findings enrich our understanding as to how ABC transporters facilitate substrate transport across the membrane in Gram-positive bacteria.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Liu","full_name":"Liu F","initials":"F"},{"last_name":"Liang","full_name":"Liang J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Zhang","full_name":"Zhang B","initials":"B"},{"last_name":"Gao","full_name":"Gao Y","initials":"Y"},{"last_name":"Yang","full_name":"Yang X","initials":"X"},{"last_name":"Hu","full_name":"Hu T","initials":"T"},{"last_name":"Yang","full_name":"Yang H","initials":"H"},{"last_name":"Xu","full_name":"Xu W","initials":"W"},{"last_name":"Guddat","full_name":"Guddat LW","initials":"LW"},{"last_name":"Rao","full_name":"Rao Z","initials":"Z"}],"title":"Structural basis of trehalose recycling by the ABC transporter LpqY-SugABC.","pubmed_id":"33127676","type":"J","associated_entries":"7cae, 7caf, 7cag","doi":"10.1126/sciadv.abb9833"}]}
