The disease mechanism underlying p97 ATPase malfunction remains unclear. To understand how the mutation alters the ATPase regulation, we assembled a full-length p97<sub>R155H</sub> with its p47 cofactor and first visualized their structures using single-particle cryo-EM. More than one-third of the population was the dodecameric form. Nucleotide presence dissociates the dodecamer into two hexamers for its highly elevated function. The N-domains of the p97<sub>R155H</sub> mutant all show up configurations in ADP- or ATP<i>\u03b3</i>S-bound states. Our functional and structural analyses showed that the p47 binding is likely to impact the p97<sub>R155H</sub> ATPase activities via changing the conformations of arginine fingers. These functional and structural analyses underline the ATPase dysregulation with the miscommunication between the functional modules of the p97<sub>R155H</sub>.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Nandi","full_name":"Nandi P","initials":"P"},{"last_name":"Li","full_name":"Li S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Columbres","full_name":"Columbres RCA","initials":"RCA"},{"last_name":"Wang","full_name":"Wang F","initials":"F"},{"last_name":"Williams","full_name":"Williams DR","initials":"DR"},{"last_name":"Poh","full_name":"Poh YP","initials":"YP"},{"last_name":"Chou","full_name":"Chou TF","initials":"TF"},{"last_name":"Chiu","full_name":"Chiu PL","initials":"PL"}],"title":"Structural and Functional Analysis of Disease-Linked p97 ATPase Mutant Complexes.","pubmed_id":"34360842","type":"J","associated_entries":"7l5w, 7l5x, 7r7t, 7r7u","doi":"10.3390/ijms22158079"}]}
