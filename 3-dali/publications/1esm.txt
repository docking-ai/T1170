CoA is a feedback inhibitor of PanK activity by competitive binding to the ATP site. The structures of the Escherichia coli enzyme, in complex with a nonhydrolyzable analogue of ATP, 5'-adenylimido-diphosphate (AMPPNP), or with CoA, were determined at 2.6 and 2.5 A, respectively. Both structures show that two dimers occupy an asymmetric unit; each subunit has a alpha/beta mononucleotide-binding fold with an extensive antiparallel coiled coil formed by two long helices along the dimerization interface. The two ligands, AMPPNP and CoA, associate with PanK in very different ways, but their phosphate binding sites overlap, explaining the kinetic competition between CoA and ATP. Residues Asp(127), His(177), and Arg(243) are proposed to be involved in catalysis, based on modeling of the pentacoordinate transition state. The more potent inhibition by CoA, compared with the CoA thioesters, is explained by a tight interaction of the CoA thiol group with the side chains of aromatic residues, which is predicted to discriminate against the CoA thioesters. The PanK structure provides the framework for a more detailed understanding of the mechanism of catalysis and feedback regulation of PanK.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Yun","full_name":"Yun M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Park","full_name":"Park CG","initials":"CG"},{"last_name":"Kim","full_name":"Kim JY","initials":"JY"},{"last_name":"Rock","full_name":"Rock CO","initials":"CO"},{"last_name":"Jackowski","full_name":"Jackowski S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Park","full_name":"Park HW","initials":"HW"}],"title":"Structural basis for the feedback regulation of Escherichia coli pantothenate kinase by coenzyme A.","pubmed_id":"10862768","type":"J","associated_entries":"1esn","doi":"10.1074/jbc.M003190200"}]}
