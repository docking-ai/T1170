In Drosophila, an RNase III enzyme Dicer-2 (Dcr-2), aided by its cofactor Loquacious-PD (Loqs-PD), has an important role in generating 21\u2009bp siRNA duplexes from long double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs)<sub>3,4</sub>. ATP hydrolysis by the helicase domain of Dcr-2 is critical to the successful processing of a long dsRNA into consecutive siRNA duplexes<sub>5,6</sub>. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structures of Dcr-2-Loqs-PD in the apo state and in multiple states in which it is processing a 50\u2009bp dsRNA substrate. The structures elucidated interactions between Dcr-2 and Loqs-PD, and substantial conformational changes of Dcr-2 during a dsRNA-processing cycle. The N-terminal helicase and domain of unknown function 283 (DUF283) domains undergo conformational changes after initial dsRNA binding, forming an ATP-binding pocket and a 5'-phosphate-binding pocket. The overall conformation of Dcr-2-Loqs-PD is relatively rigid during translocating along the dsRNA in the presence of ATP, whereas the interactions between the DUF283 and RIIIDb domains prevent non-specific cleavage during translocation by blocking the access of dsRNA to the RNase active centre. Additional ATP-dependent conformational changes are required to form an active dicing state and precisely cleave the dsRNA into a 21\u2009bp siRNA duplex as confirmed by the structure in the post-dicing state. Collectively, this study revealed the molecular mechanism for the full cycle of ATP-dependent dsRNA processing by Dcr-2-Loqs-PD.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Su","full_name":"Su S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Wang","full_name":"Wang J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Deng","full_name":"Deng T","initials":"T"},{"last_name":"Yuan","full_name":"Yuan X","initials":"X"},{"last_name":"He","full_name":"He J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Liu","full_name":"Liu N","initials":"N"},{"last_name":"Li","full_name":"Li X","initials":"X"},{"last_name":"Huang","full_name":"Huang Y","initials":"Y"},{"last_name":"Wang","full_name":"Wang HW","initials":"HW"},{"last_name":"Ma","full_name":"Ma J","initials":"J"}],"pubmed_id":"35768513","type":"J"}]}
