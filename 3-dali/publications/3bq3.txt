Dcn1 regulates cullin neddylation and thus ubiquitin ligase activity. Here we describe the 1.9 A X-ray crystal structure of yeast Dcn1 encompassing an N-terminal ubiquitin-binding (UBA) domain and a C-terminal domain of unique architecture, which we termed PONY domain. A conserved surface on Dcn1 is required for direct binding to cullins and for neddylation. The reciprocal binding site for Dcn1 on Cdc53 is located approximately 18 A from the site of neddylation. Dcn1 does not require cysteine residues for catalytic function, and directly interacts with the Nedd8 E2 Ubc12 on a surface that overlaps with the E1-binding site. We show that Dcn1 is necessary and sufficient for cullin neddylation in a purified recombinant system. Taken together, these data demonstrate that Dcn1 is a scaffold-like E3 ligase for cullin neddylation.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Kurz","full_name":"Kurz T","initials":"T"},{"last_name":"Chou","full_name":"Chou YC","initials":"YC"},{"last_name":"Willems","full_name":"Willems AR","initials":"AR"},{"last_name":"Meyer-Schaller","full_name":"Meyer-Schaller N","initials":"N"},{"last_name":"Hecht","full_name":"Hecht ML","initials":"ML"},{"last_name":"Tyers","full_name":"Tyers M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Peter","full_name":"Peter M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Sicheri","full_name":"Sicheri F","initials":"F"}],"title":"Dcn1 functions as a scaffold-type E3 ligase for cullin neddylation.","pubmed_id":"18206966","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1016/j.molcel.2007.12.012"}]}
