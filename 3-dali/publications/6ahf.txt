Extensive studies have attempted to elucidate how HSP104 disassembles the aggregated form of clients. Here, we found that HSP104 exhibits a potent holdase activity that does not require energy, prevents the soluble form of amyloid clients from aggregating, and differs from HSP104's disaggregase activity. Using cryo-EM, NMR and additional biophysical approaches, we found that HSP104 utilizes its small subdomain of nucleotide-binding domain 2 (ssNBD2) to capture the soluble amyloid client (K19 of Tau) independent of its ATP hydrolysis activity. Our results indicate that HSP104 utilizes two fundamental distinct mechanisms to chaperone different forms of amyloid client and highlight the important yet previously unappreciated function of ssNBD2 in chaperoning amyloid client and thereby preventing pathological aggregation.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Zhang","full_name":"Zhang X","initials":"X"},{"last_name":"Zhang","full_name":"Zhang S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Zhang","full_name":"Zhang L","initials":"L"},{"last_name":"Lu","full_name":"Lu J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Zhao","full_name":"Zhao C","initials":"C"},{"last_name":"Luo","full_name":"Luo F","initials":"F"},{"last_name":"Li","full_name":"Li D","initials":"D"},{"last_name":"Li","full_name":"Li X","initials":"X"},{"last_name":"Liu","full_name":"Liu C","initials":"C"}],"title":"Heat shock protein 104 (HSP104) chaperones soluble Tau via a mechanism distinct from its disaggregase activity.","pubmed_id":"30718279","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1074/jbc.RA118.005980"}]}
