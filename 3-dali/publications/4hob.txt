In vertebrates, domains of this family are found exclusively in proteins that detect foreign nucleic acids and activate components of the antiviral interferon response. Moreover, poxviruses encode the Zalpha domain-containing protein E3L, a well-studied and potent inhibitor of interferon response. Here we describe a herpesvirus Zalpha-domain-containing protein (ORF112) from cyprinid herpesvirus 3. We demonstrate that ORF112 also binds CpG repeats in the left-handed conformation, and moreover, its structure at 1.75 \u00c5 reveals the Zalpha fold found in ADAR1, DAI, PKZ, and E3L. Unlike other Zalpha domains, however, ORF112 forms a dimer through a unique domain-swapping mechanism. Thus, ORF112 may be considered a new member of the Z-domain family having DNA binding properties similar to those of the poxvirus E3L inhibitor of interferon response.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Tom\u00e9","full_name":"Tom\u00e9 AR","initials":"AR"},{"last_name":"Ku\u015b","full_name":"Ku\u015b K","initials":"K"},{"last_name":"Correia","full_name":"Correia S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Paulo","full_name":"Paulo LM","initials":"LM"},{"last_name":"Zacarias","full_name":"Zacarias S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"de Rosa","full_name":"de Rosa M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Figueiredo","full_name":"Figueiredo D","initials":"D"},{"last_name":"Parkhouse","full_name":"Parkhouse RM","initials":"RM"},{"last_name":"Athanasiadis","full_name":"Athanasiadis A","initials":"A"}],"pubmed_id":"23365431","type":"J"}]}
