Despite recent progress in structure elucidation, a number of intermediates have yet to be visualized and mechanistically interpreted. Here, we combine cryogenic-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), double electron-electron resonance spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations to profile a previously unobserved intermediate of BmrCD, a heterodimeric multidrug ABC exporter from Bacillus subtilis. In our cryo-EM structure, ATP-bound BmrCD adopts an inward-facing architecture featuring two molecules of the substrate Hoechst-33342 in a striking asymmetric head-to-tail arrangement. Deletion of the extracellular domain capping the substrate-binding chamber or mutation of Hoechst-coordinating residues abrogates cooperative stimulation of ATP hydrolysis. Together, our findings support a mechanistic role for symmetry mismatch between the nucleotide binding and the transmembrane domains in the conformational cycle of ABC transporters and is of notable importance for rational design of molecules for targeted ABC transporter inhibition.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Thaker","full_name":"Thaker TM","initials":"TM"},{"last_name":"Mishra","full_name":"Mishra S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Zhou","full_name":"Zhou W","initials":"W"},{"last_name":"Mohan","full_name":"Mohan M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Tang","full_name":"Tang Q","initials":"Q"},{"last_name":"Faraldo-Gom\u00e9z","full_name":"Faraldo-Gom\u00e9z JD","initials":"JD"},{"last_name":"Mchaourab","full_name":"Mchaourab HS","initials":"HS"},{"last_name":"Tomasiak","full_name":"Tomasiak TM","initials":"TM"}],"title":"Asymmetric drug binding in an ATP-loaded inward-facing state of an ABC transporter.","pubmed_id":"34931066","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1038/s41589-021-00936-x"}]}
