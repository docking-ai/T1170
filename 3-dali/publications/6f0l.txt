ATP hydrolysis by MCM is required for loading and the post-catalytic MCM is an inactive double hexamer that encircles duplex DNA. Origin firing depends on MCM engagement of Cdc45 and GINS to form the CMG holo-helicase. CMG assembly requires several steps including MCM phosphorylation by DDK. To understand origin activation, here we have determined the cryo-EM structures of DNA-bound MCM, either unmodified or phosphorylated, and visualize a phospho-dependent MCM element likely important for Cdc45 recruitment. MCM pore loops touch both the Watson and Crick strands, constraining duplex DNA in a bent configuration. By comparing our new MCM-DNA structure with the structure of CMG-DNA, we suggest how the conformational transition from the loaded, post-catalytic MCM to CMG might promote DNA untwisting and melting at the onset of replication.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Abid Ali","full_name":"Abid Ali F","initials":"F"},{"last_name":"Douglas","full_name":"Douglas ME","initials":"ME"},{"last_name":"Locke","full_name":"Locke J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Pye","full_name":"Pye VE","initials":"VE"},{"last_name":"Nans","full_name":"Nans A","initials":"A"},{"last_name":"Diffley","full_name":"Diffley JFX","initials":"JFX"},{"last_name":"Costa","full_name":"Costa A","initials":"A"}],"title":"Cryo-EM structure of a licensed DNA replication origin.","pubmed_id":"29269875","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1038/s41467-017-02389-0"}]}
