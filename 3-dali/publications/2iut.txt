In addition to its role as activator of XerCD site-specific recombination, FtsK can translocate double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) rapidly and directionally and reverse direction. We present crystal structures of the FtsK motor domain monomer, showing that it has a RecA-like core, the FtsK hexamer, and also showing that it is a ring with a large central annulus and a dodecamer consisting of two hexamers, head to head. Electron microscopy (EM) demonstrates the DNA-dependent existence of hexamers in solution and shows that duplex DNA passes through the middle of each ring. Comparison of FtsK monomer structures from two different crystal forms highlights a conformational change that we propose is the structural basis for a rotary inchworm mechanism of DNA translocation.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Massey","full_name":"Massey TH","initials":"TH"},{"last_name":"Mercogliano","full_name":"Mercogliano CP","initials":"CP"},{"last_name":"Yates","full_name":"Yates J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Sherratt","full_name":"Sherratt DJ","initials":"DJ"},{"last_name":"L\u00f6we","full_name":"L\u00f6we J","initials":"J"}],"title":"Double-stranded DNA translocation: structure and mechanism of hexameric FtsK.","pubmed_id":"16916635","type":"J","associated_entries":"2ius, 2iuu","doi":"10.1016/j.molcel.2006.06.019"}]}
