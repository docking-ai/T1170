ATAD2 AAA+\u2009ATPases are a family of histone chaperones that regulate nucleosome density and chromatin dynamics. Here, we demonstrate that the fission yeast ATAD2 homolog, Abo1, deposits histone H3-H4 onto DNA in an ATP-hydrolysis-dependent manner by in vitro reconstitution and single-tethered DNA curtain assays. We present cryo-EM structures of an ATAD2 family ATPase to atomic resolution in three different nucleotide states, revealing unique structural features required for histone loading on DNA, and directly visualize the transitions of Abo1 from an asymmetric spiral (ATP-state) to a symmetric ring (ADP- and apo-states) using high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM). Furthermore, we find that the acidic pore of ATP-Abo1 binds a peptide substrate which is suggestive of a histone tail. Based on these results, we propose a model whereby Abo1 facilitates H3-H4 loading by utilizing ATP.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Cho","full_name":"Cho C","initials":"C"},{"last_name":"Jang","full_name":"Jang J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Kang","full_name":"Kang Y","initials":"Y"},{"last_name":"Watanabe","full_name":"Watanabe H","initials":"H"},{"last_name":"Uchihashi","full_name":"Uchihashi T","initials":"T"},{"last_name":"Kim","full_name":"Kim SJ","initials":"SJ"},{"last_name":"Kato","full_name":"Kato K","initials":"K"},{"last_name":"Lee","full_name":"Lee JY","initials":"JY"},{"last_name":"Song","full_name":"Song JJ","initials":"JJ"}],"title":"Structural basis of nucleosome assembly by the Abo1 AAA+\u00a0ATPase histone chaperone.","pubmed_id":"31848341","type":"J","associated_entries":"6jpq, 6jpu","doi":"10.1038/s41467-019-13743-9"}]}
