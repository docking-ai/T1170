CED-4 forms an octameric apoptosome, which binds the CED-3 zymogen and facilitates its autocatalytic maturation. Despite recent advances, major questions remain unanswered. Importantly, how CED-4 recognizes CED-3 and how such binding facilitates CED-3 activation remain completely unknown. Here we demonstrate that the L2' loop of CED-3 directly binds CED-4 and plays a major role in the formation of an active CED-4-CED-3 holoenzyme. The crystal structure of the CED-4 apoptosome bound to the L2' loop fragment of CED-3, determined at 3.2 \u00c5 resolution, reveals specific interactions between a stretch of five hydrophobic amino acids from CED-3 and a shallow surface pocket within the hutch of the funnel-shaped CED-4 apoptosome. Structure-guided biochemical analysis confirms the functional importance of the observed CED-4-CED-3 interface. Structural analysis together with published evidence strongly suggest a working model in which two molecules of CED-3 zymogen, through specific recognition, are forced into the hutch of the CED-4 apoptosome, consequently undergoing dimerization and autocatalytic maturation. The mechanism of CED-3 activation represents a major revision of the prevailing model for initiator caspase activation.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Huang","full_name":"Huang W","initials":"W"},{"last_name":"Jiang","full_name":"Jiang T","initials":"T"},{"last_name":"Choi","full_name":"Choi W","initials":"W"},{"last_name":"Qi","full_name":"Qi S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Pang","full_name":"Pang Y","initials":"Y"},{"last_name":"Hu","full_name":"Hu Q","initials":"Q"},{"last_name":"Xu","full_name":"Xu Y","initials":"Y"},{"last_name":"Gong","full_name":"Gong X","initials":"X"},{"last_name":"Jeffrey","full_name":"Jeffrey PD","initials":"PD"},{"last_name":"Wang","full_name":"Wang J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Shi","full_name":"Shi Y","initials":"Y"}],"title":"Mechanistic insights into CED-4-mediated activation of CED-3.","pubmed_id":"24065769","type":"J","associated_entries":"4m9r, 4m9x, 4m9y, 4m9z","doi":"10.1101/gad.224428.113"}]}
