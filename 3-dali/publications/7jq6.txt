We present the first atomic-resolution crystal structure of a multimeric ring form of a viral dsDNA packaging motor, the ATPase of the ascc\u03c628 phage, and characterize its atomic-level dynamics via long timescale molecular dynamics simulations. Based on these results, and previous single-molecule data and cryo-EM reconstruction of the homologous \u03c629 motor, we propose an overall packaging model that is driven by helical-to-planar transitions of the ring motor. These transitions are coordinated by inter-subunit interactions that regulate catalytic and force-generating events. Stepwise ATP binding to individual subunits increase their affinity for the helical DNA phosphate backbone, resulting in distortion away from the planar ring towards a helical configuration, inducing mechanical strain. Subsequent sequential hydrolysis events alleviate the accumulated mechanical strain, allowing a stepwise return of the motor to the planar conformation, translocating DNA in the process. This type of helical-to-planar mechanism could serve as a general framework for ring ATPases.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Pajak","full_name":"Pajak J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Dill","full_name":"Dill E","initials":"E"},{"last_name":"Reyes-Aldrete","full_name":"Reyes-Aldrete E","initials":"E"},{"last_name":"White","full_name":"White MA","initials":"MA"},{"last_name":"Kelch","full_name":"Kelch BA","initials":"BA"},{"last_name":"Jardine","full_name":"Jardine PJ","initials":"PJ"},{"last_name":"Arya","full_name":"Arya G","initials":"G"},{"last_name":"Morais","full_name":"Morais MC","initials":"MC"}],"title":"Atomistic basis of force generation, translocation, and coordination in a viral genome packaging motor.","pubmed_id":"34050764","type":"J","associated_entries":"7jq7, 7jqp","doi":"10.1093/nar/gkab372"}]}
