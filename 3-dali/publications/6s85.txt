To initiate DSB repair by end joining or homologous recombination, the Mre11-nuclease Rad50-ATPase complex detects and processes diverse and obstructed DNA ends, but a structural mechanism is still lacking. Here we report cryo-EM structures of the E.\u00a0coli Mre11-Rad50 homolog SbcCD in resting and DNA-bound cutting states. In the resting state, Mre11's nuclease is blocked by ATP-Rad50, and the Rad50 coiled coils appear flexible. Upon DNA binding, the two coiled coils zip up into a rod and, together with the Rad50 nucleotide-binding domains, form a clamp around dsDNA. Mre11 moves to the side of Rad50, binds the DNA end, and assembles a DNA cutting channel for the nuclease reactions. The structures reveal how Mre11-Rad50 can detect and process diverse DNA ends and uncover a clamping and gating function for the coiled coils.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"K\u00e4shammer","full_name":"K\u00e4shammer L","initials":"L"},{"last_name":"Saathoff","full_name":"Saathoff JH","initials":"JH"},{"last_name":"Lammens","full_name":"Lammens K","initials":"K"},{"last_name":"Gut","full_name":"Gut F","initials":"F"},{"last_name":"Bartho","full_name":"Bartho J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Alt","full_name":"Alt A","initials":"A"},{"last_name":"Kessler","full_name":"Kessler B","initials":"B"},{"last_name":"Hopfner","full_name":"Hopfner KP","initials":"KP"}],"title":"Mechanism of DNA End Sensing and Processing by the Mre11-Rad50 Complex.","pubmed_id":"31492634","type":"J","associated_entries":"6s6v","doi":"10.1016/j.molcel.2019.07.035"}]}
