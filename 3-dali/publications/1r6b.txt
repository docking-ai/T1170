ClpA consists of three functional domains: an N-terminal domain and two ATPase domains, D1 and D2. The N-domain is attached to D1 by a mobile linker and is made up of two tightly bound, identically folded alpha-helical bundles related by a pseudo 2-fold symmetry. Between the halves of the pseudo-dimer is a large flexible acidic loop that becomes better ordered upon binding of the small adaptor protein, ClpS. We have identified a number of structural features in the N-domain, including a Zn(++) binding motif, several interfaces for binding to ClpS, and a prominent hydrophobic surface area that binds peptides in different configurations. These structural motifs may contribute to binding of protein or peptide substrates with weak affinity and broad specificity. Kinetic studies comparing wild-type ClpA to a mutant ClpA with its N-domain deleted show that the N-domains contribute to the binding of a non-specific protein substrate but not of a folded substrate with the specific SsrA recognition tag. A functional model is proposed in which the N-domains in ClpA function as tentacles to weakly hold on to proteins thereby enhancing local substrate concentration.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Xia","full_name":"Xia D","initials":"D"},{"last_name":"Esser","full_name":"Esser L","initials":"L"},{"last_name":"Singh","full_name":"Singh SK","initials":"SK"},{"last_name":"Guo","full_name":"Guo F","initials":"F"},{"last_name":"Maurizi","full_name":"Maurizi MR","initials":"MR"}],"title":"Crystallographic investigation of peptide binding sites in the N-domain of the ClpA chaperone.","pubmed_id":"15037248","type":"J","associated_entries":"1k6k, 1ksf, 1r6c, 1r6o, 1r6q","doi":"10.1016/j.jsb.2003.11.025"},{"journal_info":{"volume":"277","pdb_abbreviation":"J Biol Chem","ISO_abbreviation":"J Biol Chem","year":2002,"issue":"48","pages":"46743-52"},"abstract":{"methods":null,"conclusions":null,"results":null,"unassigned":"Escherichia coli ClpA, an Hsp100/Clp chaperone and an integral component of the ATP-dependent ClpAP protease, participates in regulatory protein degradation and the dissolution and degradation of protein aggregates. The crystal structure of the ClpA subunit reveals an N-terminal domain with pseudo-twofold symmetry and two AAA(+) modules (D1 and D2) each consisting of a large and a small sub-domain with ADP bound in the sub-domain junction. The N-terminal domain interacts with the D1 domain in a manner similar to adaptor-binding domains of other AAA(+) proteins. D1 and D2 are connected head-to-tail consistent with a cooperative and vectorial translocation of protein substrates. In a planar hexamer model of ClpA, built by assembling ClpA D1 and D2 into homohexameric rings of known structures of AAA(+) modules, the differences in D1-D1 and D2-D2 interfaces correlate with their respective contributions to hexamer stability and ATPase activity.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Guo","full_name":"Guo F","initials":"F"},{"last_name":"Maurizi","full_name":"Maurizi MR","initials":"MR"},{"last_name":"Esser","full_name":"Esser L","initials":"L"},{"last_name":"Xia","full_name":"Xia D","initials":"D"}],"title":"Crystal structure of ClpA, an Hsp100 chaperone and regulator of ClpAP protease.","pubmed_id":"12205096","type":"J","associated_entries":"1k6k, 1ksf, 1r6c, 1r6o, 1r6q","doi":"10.1074/jbc.M207796200"}]}
