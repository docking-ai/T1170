Its proteolytic activity is associated with diverse cellular functions ranging from maintaining proteostasis under normal and stress conditions to regulating cell metabolism. Although Lon was originally identified as an ATP-dependent protease with fused AAA+ (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities) and protease domains, analyses have recently identified LonC as a class of Lon-like proteases with no intrinsic ATPase activity. In contrast to the canonical ATP-dependent Lon present in eukaryotic organelles and prokaryotes, LonC contains an AAA-like domain that lacks the conserved ATPase motifs. Moreover, the LonC AAA-like domain is inserted with a large domain predicted to be largely \u03b1-helical; intriguingly, this unique Lon-insertion domain (LID) was disordered in the recently determined full-length crystal structure of Meiothermus taiwanensis LonC (MtaLonC). Here, the crystal structure of the N-terminal AAA-like \u03b1/\u03b2 subdomain of MtaLonC containing an intact LID, which forms a large \u03b1-helical hairpin protruding from the AAA-like domain, is reported. The structure of the LID is remarkably similar to the tentacle-like prong of the periplasmic chaperone Skp. It is shown that the LID of LonC is involved both in Skp-like chaperone activity and in recognition of unfolded protein substrates. The structure allows the construction of a complete model of LonC with six helical hairpin extensions defining a basket-like structure atop the AAA ring and encircling the entry portal to the barrel-like degradation chamber of Lon.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Li","full_name":"Li JK","initials":"JK"},{"last_name":"Liao","full_name":"Liao JH","initials":"JH"},{"last_name":"Li","full_name":"Li H","initials":"H"},{"last_name":"Kuo","full_name":"Kuo CI","initials":"CI"},{"last_name":"Huang","full_name":"Huang KF","initials":"KF"},{"last_name":"Yang","full_name":"Yang LW","initials":"LW"},{"last_name":"Wu","full_name":"Wu SH","initials":"SH"},{"last_name":"Chang","full_name":"Chang CI","initials":"CI"}],"title":"The N-terminal substrate-recognition domain of a LonC protease exhibits structural and functional similarity to cytosolic chaperones.","pubmed_id":"23999302","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1107/S090744491301500X"}]}
