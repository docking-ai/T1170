However, the translocation along single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and the strand separation of double-stranded (dsDNA) may be loosely or tightly coupled. Dda is a phage T4 SF1B helicase with sequence homology to the Pif1 family of helicases that tightly couples translocation to strand separation. The crystal structure of the Dda-ssDNA binary complex reveals a domain referred to as the \"pin\" that was previously thought to remain static during strand separation. The pin contains a conserved phenylalanine that mediates a transient base-stacking interaction that is absolutely required for separation of dsDNA. The pin is secured at its tip by protein-protein interactions through an extended SH3 domain thereby creating a rigid strut. The conserved interface between the pin and the SH3 domain provides the mechanism for tight coupling of translocation to strand separation.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"He","full_name":"He X","initials":"X"},{"last_name":"Byrd","full_name":"Byrd AK","initials":"AK"},{"last_name":"Yun","full_name":"Yun MK","initials":"MK"},{"last_name":"Pemble","full_name":"Pemble CW","initials":"CW"},{"last_name":"Harrison","full_name":"Harrison D","initials":"D"},{"last_name":"Yeruva","full_name":"Yeruva L","initials":"L"},{"last_name":"Dahl","full_name":"Dahl C","initials":"C"},{"last_name":"Kreuzer","full_name":"Kreuzer KN","initials":"KN"},{"last_name":"Raney","full_name":"Raney KD","initials":"KD"},{"last_name":"White","full_name":"White SW","initials":"SW"}],"title":"The T4 Phage SF1B Helicase Dda Is Structurally Optimized to Perform DNA Strand Separation.","pubmed_id":"22658750","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1016/j.str.2012.04.013"}]}
