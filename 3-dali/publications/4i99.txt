Their asymmetric structural core comprises SMC heterodimers that associate with both ends of a kleisin subunit. However, prokaryotic condensin Smc-ScpAB is composed of symmetric Smc homodimers associated with the kleisin ScpA in a postulated symmetrical manner. Here, we demonstrate that Smc molecules have two distinct binding sites for ScpA. The N terminus of ScpA binds the Smc coiled coil, whereas the C terminus binds the Smc ATPase domain. We show that in Bacillus subtilis cells, an Smc dimer is bridged by a single ScpAB to generate asymmetric tripartite rings analogous to eukaryotic SMC complexes. We define a molecular mechanism that ensures asymmetric assembly, and we conclude that the basic architecture of SMC-kleisin rings evolved before the emergence of eukaryotes.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"B\u00fcrmann","full_name":"B\u00fcrmann F","initials":"F"},{"last_name":"Shin","full_name":"Shin HC","initials":"HC"},{"last_name":"Basquin","full_name":"Basquin J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Soh","full_name":"Soh YM","initials":"YM"},{"last_name":"Gim\u00e9nez-Oya","full_name":"Gim\u00e9nez-Oya V","initials":"V"},{"last_name":"Kim","full_name":"Kim YG","initials":"YG"},{"last_name":"Oh","full_name":"Oh BH","initials":"BH"},{"last_name":"Gruber","full_name":"Gruber S","initials":"S"}],"title":"An asymmetric SMC-kleisin bridge in prokaryotic condensin.","pubmed_id":"23353789","type":"J","associated_entries":"3zgx, 4i98","doi":"10.1038/nsmb.2488"}]}
