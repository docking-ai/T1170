Consequently, cells encode multiple systems that remodel nucleosomes. These complexes can be simple, involving one or a few protein subunits, or more complicated multi-subunit machines <sub>1</sub> . Biochemical studies<sub>2-4</sub> have placed the motor domains of several chromatin remodellers in the superhelical location 2 region of the nucleosome. Structural studies of yeast Chd1 and Snf2-a subunit in the complex with the capacity to remodel the structure of chromatin (RSC)-in complex with nucleosomes<sub>5-7</sub> have provided insights into the basic mechanism of nucleosome sliding performed by these complexes. However, how larger, multi-subunit remodelling complexes such as INO80 interact with nucleosomes and how remodellers carry out functions such as nucleosome sliding <sub>8</sub> , histone exchange <sub>9</sub> and nucleosome spacing<sub>10-12</sub> remain poorly understood. Although some remodellers work as monomers <sub>13</sub> , others work as highly cooperative dimers<sub>11, 14, 15</sub>. Here we present the structure of the human INO80 chromatin remodeller with a bound nucleosome, which reveals that INO80 interacts with nucleosomes in a previously undescribed manner: the motor domains are located on the DNA at the entry point to the nucleosome, rather than at superhelical location 2. The ARP5-IES6 module of INO80 makes additional contacts on the opposite side of the nucleosome. This arrangement enables the histone H3 tails of the nucleosome to have a role in the regulation of the activities of the INO80 motor domain-unlike in other characterized remodellers, for which H4 tails have been shown to regulate the motor domains.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Ayala","full_name":"Ayala R","initials":"R"},{"last_name":"Willhoft","full_name":"Willhoft O","initials":"O"},{"last_name":"Aramayo","full_name":"Aramayo RJ","initials":"RJ"},{"last_name":"Wilkinson","full_name":"Wilkinson M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"McCormack","full_name":"McCormack EA","initials":"EA"},{"last_name":"Ocloo","full_name":"Ocloo L","initials":"L"},{"last_name":"Wigley","full_name":"Wigley DB","initials":"DB"},{"last_name":"Zhang","full_name":"Zhang X","initials":"X"}],"title":"Structure and regulation of the human INO80-nucleosome complex.","pubmed_id":"29643506","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1038/s41586-018-0021-6"}]}
