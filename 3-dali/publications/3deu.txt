The MarR family of transcription factors (TFs) has undergone extensive duplication and diversification in bacteria, where they act as environmentally responsive repressors of genes encoding efflux pumps that confer resistance to xenobiotics, including many antimicrobial agents. We have performed structural, functional, and genetic analyses of representative members of the SlyA/RovA lineage of MarR TFs, which retain some ancestral functions, including repression of their own expression and that of divergently transcribed multidrug efflux pumps, as well as allosteric inhibition by aromatic carboxylate compounds. However, SlyA and RovA have acquired the ability to countersilence horizontally acquired genes, which has greatly facilitated the evolution of <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> by horizontal gene transfer. SlyA/RovA TFs in different species have independently evolved novel regulatory circuits to provide the enhanced levels of expression required for their new role. Moreover, in contrast to MarR, SlyA is not responsive to copper. These observations demonstrate the ability of TFs to acquire new functions as a result of evolutionary divergence of both <i>cis</i>-regulatory sequences and in <i>trans</i> interactions with modulatory ligands.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Will","full_name":"Will WR","initials":"WR"},{"last_name":"Brzovic","full_name":"Brzovic P","initials":"P"},{"last_name":"Le Trong","full_name":"Le Trong I","initials":"I"},{"last_name":"Stenkamp","full_name":"Stenkamp RE","initials":"RE"},{"last_name":"Lawrenz","full_name":"Lawrenz MB","initials":"MB"},{"last_name":"Karlinsey","full_name":"Karlinsey JE","initials":"JE"},{"last_name":"Navarre","full_name":"Navarre WW","initials":"WW"},{"last_name":"Main-Hester","full_name":"Main-Hester K","initials":"K"},{"last_name":"Miller","full_name":"Miller VL","initials":"VL"},{"last_name":"Libby","full_name":"Libby SJ","initials":"SJ"},{"last_name":"Fang","full_name":"Fang FC","initials":"FC"}],"title":"The Evolution of SlyA/RovA Transcription Factors from Repressors to Countersilencers in <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i>.","pubmed_id":"30837332","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1128/mBio.00009-19"}]}
