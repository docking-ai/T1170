The tandem ATPase domains (D1 and D2) of the p97/Cdc48 hexamer form stacked rings. p97/Cdc48 can unfold substrates by threading them through the central pore. The pore loops critical for substrate unfolding are, however, not well-ordered in substrate-free p97/Cdc48 conformations. How p97/Cdc48 organizes its pore loops for substrate engagement is unclear. Here we show that p97/Cdc48 can form double hexamers (DH) connected through the D2 ring. Cryo-EM structures of p97 DH reveal an ATPase-competent conformation with ordered pore loops. The C-terminal extension (CTE) links neighboring D2s in each hexamer and expands the central pore of the D2 ring. Mutations of Cdc48 CTE abolish substrate unfolding. We propose that the p97/Cdc48 DH captures a potentiated state poised for substrate engagement.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Gao","full_name":"Gao H","initials":"H"},{"last_name":"Li","full_name":"Li F","initials":"F"},{"last_name":"Ji","full_name":"Ji Z","initials":"Z"},{"last_name":"Shi","full_name":"Shi Z","initials":"Z"},{"last_name":"Li","full_name":"Li Y","initials":"Y"},{"last_name":"Yu","full_name":"Yu H","initials":"H"}],"pubmed_id":"35190543","type":"J"}]}
