However, the DNA-mediated regulation of Lon remains elusive. Here, the crystal structure of the \u03b1 subdomain of the Lon protease from Brevibacillus thermoruber (Bt-Lon) is presented, together with biochemical data, and the DNA-binding mode is delineated, showing that Arg518, Arg557 and Arg566 play a crucial role in DNA binding. Electrostatic interactions contributed by arginine residues in the AAA(+) module are suggested to be important to DNA binding and allosteric regulation of enzymatic activities. Intriguingly, Arg557, which directly binds DNA in the \u03b1 subdomain, has a dual role in the negative regulation of ATPase stimulation by DNA and in the domain-domain communication in allosteric regulation of Bt-Lon by substrate. In conclusion, structural and biochemical evidence is provided to show that electrostatic interaction in the AAA(+) module is important for DNA binding by Lon and allosteric regulation of its enzymatic activities by DNA and substrate.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Lee","full_name":"Lee AY","initials":"AY"},{"last_name":"Chen","full_name":"Chen YD","initials":"YD"},{"last_name":"Chang","full_name":"Chang YY","initials":"YY"},{"last_name":"Lin","full_name":"Lin YC","initials":"YC"},{"last_name":"Chang","full_name":"Chang CF","initials":"CF"},{"last_name":"Huang","full_name":"Huang SJ","initials":"SJ"},{"last_name":"Wu","full_name":"Wu SH","initials":"SH"},{"last_name":"Hsu","full_name":"Hsu CH","initials":"CH"}],"title":"Structural basis for DNA-mediated allosteric regulation facilitated by the AAA(+) module of Lon protease.","pubmed_id":"24531457","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1107/S139900471302631X"}]}
