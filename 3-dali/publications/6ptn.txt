Here we show that Ctf4 tightly dimerizes CMG helicase, with an extensive interface involving Psf2, Cdc45, and Sld5. Interestingly, Ctf4 binds only one Pol \u03b1-primase. Thus, Ctf4 may have evolved as a trimer to organize two helicases and one Pol \u03b1-primase into a replication factory. In the 2CMG-Ctf4<sub>3</sub>-1Pol \u03b1-primase factory model, the two CMGs nearly face each other, placing the two lagging strands toward the center and two leading strands out the sides. The single Pol \u03b1-primase is centrally located and may prime both sister replisomes. The Ctf4-coupled-sister replisome model is consistent with cellular microscopy studies revealing two sister forks of an origin remain attached and are pushed forward from a protein platform. The replication factory model may facilitate parental nucleosome transfer during replication.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Yuan","full_name":"Yuan Z","initials":"Z"},{"last_name":"Georgescu","full_name":"Georgescu R","initials":"R"},{"last_name":"Santos","full_name":"Santos RLA","initials":"RLA"},{"last_name":"Zhang","full_name":"Zhang D","initials":"D"},{"last_name":"Bai","full_name":"Bai L","initials":"L"},{"last_name":"Yao","full_name":"Yao NY","initials":"NY"},{"last_name":"Zhao","full_name":"Zhao G","initials":"G"},{"last_name":"O'Donnell","full_name":"O'Donnell ME","initials":"ME"},{"last_name":"Li","full_name":"Li H","initials":"H"}],"title":"Ctf4 organizes sister replisomes and Pol \u03b1 into a replication factory.","pubmed_id":"31589141","type":"J","associated_entries":"6ptj, 6pto","doi":"10.7554/eLife.47405"}]}
