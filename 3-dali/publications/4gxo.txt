Although cysteine (Cys) in various proteins can be subject to multiple PTMs, its phosphorylation was previously considered a rare PTM with almost no regulatory role assigned. We report here that phosphorylation occurs to a reactive cysteine residue conserved in the staphylococcal accessary regulator A (SarA)/MarR family global transcriptional regulator A (MgrA) family of proteins, and is mediated by the eukaryotic-like kinase-phosphatase pair Stk1-Stp1 in Staphylococcus aureus. Cys-phosphorylation is crucial in regulating virulence determinant production and bacterial resistance to vancomycin. Cell wall-targeting antibiotics, such as vancomycin and ceftriaxone, inhibit the kinase activity of Stk1 and lead to decreased Cys-phosphorylation of SarA and MgrA. An in vivo mouse model of infection established that the absence of stp1, which results in elevated protein Cys-phosphorylation, significantly reduces staphylococcal virulence. Our data indicate that Cys-phosphorylation is a unique PTM that can play crucial roles in bacterial signaling and regulation.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Sun","full_name":"Sun F","initials":"F"},{"last_name":"Ding","full_name":"Ding Y","initials":"Y"},{"last_name":"Ji","full_name":"Ji Q","initials":"Q"},{"last_name":"Liang","full_name":"Liang Z","initials":"Z"},{"last_name":"Deng","full_name":"Deng X","initials":"X"},{"last_name":"Wong","full_name":"Wong CC","initials":"CC"},{"last_name":"Yi","full_name":"Yi C","initials":"C"},{"last_name":"Zhang","full_name":"Zhang L","initials":"L"},{"last_name":"Xie","full_name":"Xie S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Alvarez","full_name":"Alvarez S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Hicks","full_name":"Hicks LM","initials":"LM"},{"last_name":"Luo","full_name":"Luo C","initials":"C"},{"last_name":"Jiang","full_name":"Jiang H","initials":"H"},{"last_name":"Lan","full_name":"Lan L","initials":"L"},{"last_name":"He","full_name":"He C","initials":"C"}],"title":"Protein cysteine phosphorylation of SarA/MgrA family transcriptional regulators mediates bacterial virulence and antibiotic resistance.","pubmed_id":"22927394","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1073/pnas.1205952109"}]}
