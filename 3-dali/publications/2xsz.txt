They play an important role in chromatin remodeling, transcriptional regulation and DNA damage repair. RuvBL1 and RuvBL2 are overexpressed in different types of cancer and interact with major oncogenic factors, such as \u03b2-catenin and c-Myc regulating their function. We solved the first three-dimensional crystal structure of the human RuvBL complex with a truncated domain II and show that this complex is competent for helicase activity. The structure reveals a dodecamer consisting of two heterohexameric rings with alternating RuvBL1 and RuvBL2 monomers bound to ADP/ATP, that interact with each other via the retained part of domain II. The dodecameric quaternary structure of the R1\u0394DII/R2\u0394DII complex observed in the crystal structure was confirmed by small-angle X-ray scattering analysis. Interestingly, truncation of domain II led to a substantial increase in ATP consumption of RuvBL1, RuvBL2 and their complex. In addition, we present evidence that DNA unwinding of the human RuvBL proteins can be auto-inhibited by domain II, which is not present in the homologous bacterial helicase RuvB. Our data give new insights into the molecular arrangement of RuvBL1 and RuvBL2 and strongly suggest that in vivo activities of these highly interesting therapeutic drug targets are regulated by cofactors inducing conformational changes via domain II in order to modulate the enzyme complex into its active state.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Gorynia","full_name":"Gorynia S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Bandeiras","full_name":"Bandeiras TM","initials":"TM"},{"last_name":"Pinho","full_name":"Pinho FG","initials":"FG"},{"last_name":"McVey","full_name":"McVey CE","initials":"CE"},{"last_name":"Vonrhein","full_name":"Vonrhein C","initials":"C"},{"last_name":"Round","full_name":"Round A","initials":"A"},{"last_name":"Svergun","full_name":"Svergun DI","initials":"DI"},{"last_name":"Donner","full_name":"Donner P","initials":"P"},{"last_name":"Matias","full_name":"Matias PM","initials":"PM"},{"last_name":"Carrondo","full_name":"Carrondo MA","initials":"MA"}],"title":"Structural and functional insights into a dodecameric molecular machine - the RuvBL1/RuvBL2 complex.","pubmed_id":"21933716","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1016/j.jsb.2011.09.001"},{"journal_info":{"volume":"64","pdb_abbreviation":"Acta Crystallogr.

The truncated RuvBL1-RuvBL2 complex was crystallized using the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method at 293 K. The crystals were hexagonal-shaped plates and belonged to either the orthorhombic space group C222(1), with unit-cell parameters a = 111.4, b = 188.0, c = 243.4 A and six monomers in the asymmetric unit, or the monoclinic space group P2(1), with unit-cell parameters a = 109.2, b = 243.4, c = 109.3 A, beta = 118.7 degrees and 12 monomers in the asymmetric unit. The crystal structure could be solved by molecular replacement in both possible space groups and the solutions obtained showed that the complex forms a dodecamer.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Gorynia","full_name":"Gorynia S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Matias","full_name":"Matias PM","initials":"PM"},{"last_name":"Bandeiras","full_name":"Bandeiras TM","initials":"TM"},{"last_name":"Donner","full_name":"Donner P","initials":"P"},{"last_name":"Carrondo","full_name":"Carrondo MA","initials":"MA"}],"title":"Cloning, expression, purification, crystallization and preliminary X-ray analysis of the human RuvBL1-RuvBL2 complex.","pubmed_id":"18765919","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1107/S174430910802558X"}]}
