In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the essential SWI/SNF complex RSC<sub>3</sub> contains 16 subunits, including the ATP-dependent DNA translocase Sth1<sub>4,5</sub>. RSC removes nucleosomes from promoter regions<sub>6,7</sub> and positions the specialized +1 and -1 nucleosomes that flank NDRs<sub>8,9</sub>. Here we present the cryo-electron microscopy structure of RSC in complex with a nucleosome substrate. The structure reveals that RSC forms five protein modules and suggests key features of the remodelling mechanism. The body module serves as a scaffold for the four flexible modules that we call DNA-interacting, ATPase, arm and actin-related protein (ARP) modules. The DNA-interacting module binds extra-nucleosomal DNA and is involved in the recognition of promoter DNA elements<sub>8,10,11</sub> that influence RSC functionality<sub>12</sub>. The ATPase and arm modules sandwich the nucleosome disc with the Snf2 ATP-coupling (SnAC) domain and the finger helix, respectively. The translocase motor of the ATPase module engages with the edge of the nucleosome at superhelical location +2. The mobile ARP module may modulate translocase-nucleosome interactions to regulate RSC activity<sub>5</sub>. The RSC-nucleosome structure provides a basis for understanding NDR formation and the structure and function of human SWI/SNF complexes that are frequently mutated in cancer<sub>13</sub>.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Wagner","full_name":"Wagner FR","initials":"FR"},{"last_name":"Dienemann","full_name":"Dienemann C","initials":"C"},{"last_name":"Wang","full_name":"Wang H","initials":"H"},{"last_name":"St\u00fctzer","full_name":"St\u00fctzer A","initials":"A"},{"last_name":"Tegunov","full_name":"Tegunov D","initials":"D"},{"last_name":"Urlaub","full_name":"Urlaub H","initials":"H"},{"last_name":"Cramer","full_name":"Cramer P","initials":"P"}],"title":"Structure of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeller RSC bound to a nucleosome.","pubmed_id":"32188943","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1038/s41586-020-2088-0"}]}
