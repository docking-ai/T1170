All dyneins have a \u223c300-kDa motor domain consisting of a ring of six AAA+ domains. ATP hydrolysis in the AAA+ ring drives the cyclic relocation of a motile element, the linker domain, to generate the force necessary for movement. How the linker interacts with the ring during the ATP hydrolysis cycle is not known. Here we present a 3.3-\u00c5 crystal structure of the motor domain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cytoplasmic dynein, crystallized in the absence of nucleotides. The linker is docked to a conserved site on AAA5, which is confirmed by mutagenesis as functionally necessary. Nucleotide soaking experiments show that the main ATP hydrolysis site in dynein (AAA1) is in a low-nucleotide affinity conformation and reveal the nucleotide interactions of the other three sites (AAA2, AAA3 and AAA4).","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Schmidt","full_name":"Schmidt H","initials":"H"},{"last_name":"Gleave","full_name":"Gleave ES","initials":"ES"},{"last_name":"Carter","full_name":"Carter AP","initials":"AP"}],"title":"Insights into dynein motor domain function from a 3.3-\u00c5 crystal structure.","pubmed_id":"22426545","type":"J","associated_entries":"4ai6, 4akg, 4aki","doi":"10.1038/nsmb.2272"}]}
