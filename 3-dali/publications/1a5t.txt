Three consecutive domains in the structure are arranged in a C-shaped architecture. The N-terminal domain contains a nonfunctional nucleotide binding site. The catalytic component of the clamp-loader complex is the gamma subunit, which is homologous to delta'. A sequence-structure alignment suggests that nucleotides bind to gamma at an interdomain interface within the inner surface of the \"C.\" The alignment is extended to other clamp-loader complexes and to the RuvB family of DNA helicases, and suggests that each of these is assembled from C-shaped components that can open and close the jaws of the \"C\" in response to ATP binding and hydrolysis.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Guenther","full_name":"Guenther B","initials":"B"},{"last_name":"Onrust","full_name":"Onrust R","initials":"R"},{"last_name":"Sali","full_name":"Sali A","initials":"A"},{"last_name":"O'Donnell","full_name":"O'Donnell M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Kuriyan","full_name":"Kuriyan J","initials":"J"}],"title":"Crystal structure of the delta' subunit of the clamp-loader complex of E. coli DNA polymerase III.","pubmed_id":"9363942","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80417-1"},{"journal_info":{"volume":null,"pdb_abbreviation":"Thesis, The Rockefeller University","ISO_abbreviation":null,"year":1996,"issue":null,"pages":"-"},"abstract":{"methods":null,"conclusions":null,"results":null,"unassigned":null,"background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":null,"full_name":"Guenther, B.D.","initials":null}],"title":"Structural Studies on the DNA Replication Apparatus: X-Ray Crystal Structure of the Delta-Prime Subunit of Escherichia Coli DNA Polymerase III","pubmed_id":null,"type":"T","associated_entries":null,"doi":null}]}
