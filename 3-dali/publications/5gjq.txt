The C-terminal residues of Rpt3 and Rpt5 subunits in the RP can be seen inserted into surface pockets formed between adjacent \u03b1 subunits in the CP. Each of the six Rpt subunits contains a bound nucleotide, and the central gate of the CP \u03b1-ring is closed despite RP association. The six pore 1 loops in the Rpt ring are arranged similarly to a spiral staircase along the axial channel of substrate transport, which is constricted by the pore 2 loops. We also determined the cryo-EM structure of the human proteasome bound to the deubiquitinating enzyme USP14 at 4.35-\u00c5 resolution. Together, our structures provide a framework for mechanistic understanding of eukaryotic proteasome function.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Huang","full_name":"Huang X","initials":"X"},{"last_name":"Luan","full_name":"Luan B","initials":"B"},{"last_name":"Wu","full_name":"Wu J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Shi","full_name":"Shi Y","initials":"Y"}],"pubmed_id":"27428775","type":"J"}]}
