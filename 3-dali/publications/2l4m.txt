For full activation of the immune response, three DNA binding domains at the N terminus are required: two Z-DNA binding domains (ZBDs), Z\u03b1 and Z\u03b2, and an adjacent putative B-DNA binding domain. The crystal structure of the Z\u03b2 domain of human DAI (hZ\u03b2(DAI)) in complex with Z-DNA revealed structural features distinct from other known Z-DNA binding proteins, and it was classified as a group II ZBD. To gain structural insights into the DNA binding mechanism of hZ\u03b2(DAI), the solution structure of the free hZ\u03b2(DAI) was solved, and its bindings to B- and Z-DNAs were analyzed by NMR spectroscopy. Compared to the Z-DNA-bound structure, the conformation of free hZ\u03b2(DAI) has notable alterations in the \u03b13 recognition helix, the \"wing,\" and Y145, which are critical in Z-DNA recognition. Unlike some other Z\u03b1 domains, hZ\u03b2(DAI) appears to have conformational flexibility, and structural adaptation is required for Z-DNA binding. Chemical-shift perturbation experiments revealed that hZ\u03b2(DAI) also binds weakly to B-DNA via a different binding mode. The C-terminal domain of DAI is reported to undergo a conformational change on B-DNA binding; thus, it is possible that these changes are correlated. During the innate immune response, hZ\u03b2(DAI) is likely to play an active role in binding to DNAs in both B and Z conformations in the recognition of foreign DNAs.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Kim","full_name":"Kim K","initials":"K"},{"last_name":"Khayrutdinov","full_name":"Khayrutdinov BI","initials":"BI"},{"last_name":"Lee","full_name":"Lee CK","initials":"CK"},{"last_name":"Cheong","full_name":"Cheong HK","initials":"HK"},{"last_name":"Kang","full_name":"Kang SW","initials":"SW"},{"last_name":"Park","full_name":"Park H","initials":"H"},{"last_name":"Lee","full_name":"Lee S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Kim","full_name":"Kim YG","initials":"YG"},{"last_name":"Jee","full_name":"Jee J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Rich","full_name":"Rich A","initials":"A"},{"last_name":"Kim","full_name":"Kim KK","initials":"KK"},{"last_name":"Jeon","full_name":"Jeon YH","initials":"YH"}],"title":"Solution structure of the Zbeta domain of human DNA-dependent activator of IFN-regulatory factors and its binding modes to B- and Z-DNAs.","pubmed_id":"21471454","type":"B","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1073/pnas.1014898107"}]}
