The mitotic kinase NEK7 licenses the assembly and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in interphase. Here we report a cryo-electron microscopy structure of inactive human NLRP3 in complex with NEK7, at a resolution of 3.8\u00a0\u00c5. The earring-shaped NLRP3 consists of curved leucine-rich-repeat and globular NACHT domains, and the C-terminal lobe of NEK7 nestles against both NLRP3 domains. Structural recognition between NLRP3 and NEK7 is confirmed by mutagenesis both in vitro and in cells. Modelling of an active NLRP3-NEK7 conformation based on the NLRC4 inflammasome predicts an additional contact between an NLRP3-bound NEK7 and a neighbouring NLRP3. Mutations to this interface abolish the ability of NEK7 or NLRP3 to rescue NLRP3 activation in NEK7-knockout or NLRP3-knockout cells. These data suggest that NEK7 bridges adjacent NLRP3 subunits with bipartite interactions to mediate the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Sharif","full_name":"Sharif H","initials":"H"},{"last_name":"Wang","full_name":"Wang L","initials":"L"},{"last_name":"Wang","full_name":"Wang WL","initials":"WL"},{"last_name":"Magupalli","full_name":"Magupalli VG","initials":"VG"},{"last_name":"Andreeva","full_name":"Andreeva L","initials":"L"},{"last_name":"Qiao","full_name":"Qiao Q","initials":"Q"},{"last_name":"Hauenstein","full_name":"Hauenstein AV","initials":"AV"},{"last_name":"Wu","full_name":"Wu Z","initials":"Z"},{"last_name":"N\u00fa\u00f1ez","full_name":"N\u00fa\u00f1ez G","initials":"G"},{"last_name":"Mao","full_name":"Mao Y","initials":"Y"},{"last_name":"Wu","full_name":"Wu H","initials":"H"}],"pubmed_id":"31189953","type":"J"}]}
