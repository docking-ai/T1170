The FtsH protein has an N-terminal transmembrane segment and a large cytosolic region that consists of two domains, an ATPase and a protease domain. To provide a structural basis for the nucleotide-dependent domain motions and a better understanding of substrate translocation, the crystal structures of the Helicobacter pylori (Hp) FtsH ATPase domain in the nucleotide-free state and complexed with ADP, were determined. Two different structures of HpFtsH ATPase were observed, with the nucleotide-free state in an asymmetric unit, and these structures reveal the new forms and show other conformational differences between the nucleotide-free and ADP-bound state compared with previous structures. In particular, one HpFtsH Apo structure has a considerable rotation difference compared with the HpFtsH ADP complex, and this large conformational change reveals that FtsH may have the mechanical force needed for substrate translocation.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Kim","full_name":"Kim SH","initials":"SH"},{"last_name":"Kang","full_name":"Kang GB","initials":"GB"},{"last_name":"Song","full_name":"Song HE","initials":"HE"},{"last_name":"Park","full_name":"Park SJ","initials":"SJ"},{"last_name":"Bea","full_name":"Bea MH","initials":"MH"},{"last_name":"Eom","full_name":"Eom SH","initials":"SH"}],"title":"Structural studies on Helicobacter pyloriATP-dependent protease, FtsH.","pubmed_id":"18421140","type":"J","associated_entries":"2r62","doi":"10.1107/S090904950706846X"}]}
