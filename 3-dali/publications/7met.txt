Although many are promising drug targets, their mechanisms of modulation by small-molecule inhibitors remain largely unknown. Two first-generation inhibitors of the MsbA transporter, tetrahydrobenzothiophene 1 (TBT1) and G247, induce opposite effects on ATP hydrolysis. Using single-particle cryo\u2013electron microscopy and functional assays, we show that TBT1 and G247 bind adjacent yet separate pockets in the MsbA transmembrane domains. Two TBT1 molecules asymmetrically occupy the substrate-binding site, which leads to a collapsed inward-facing conformation with decreased distance between the nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs). By contrast, two G247 molecules symmetrically increase NBD distance in a wide inward-open state of MsbA. The divergent mechanisms of action of these MsbA inhibitors provide important insights into ABC transporter pharmacology.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Th\u00e9lot","full_name":"Th\u00e9lot FA","initials":"FA"},{"last_name":"Zhang","full_name":"Zhang W","initials":"W"},{"last_name":"Song","full_name":"Song K","initials":"K"},{"last_name":"Xu","full_name":"Xu C","initials":"C"},{"last_name":"Huang","full_name":"Huang J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Liao","full_name":"Liao M","initials":"M"}],"title":"Distinct allosteric mechanisms of first-generation MsbA inhibitors.","pubmed_id":"34554829","type":"J","associated_entries":"7mew, 7rit","doi":"10.1126/science.abi9009"}]}
