Earlier crystal structures have suggested that DNA helicases translocate along a single-stranded DNA in an inchworm fashion. We report here a series of crystal structures of the UvrD helicase complexed with DNA and ATP hydrolysis intermediates. These structures reveal that ATP binding alone leads to unwinding of 1 base pair by directional rotation and translation of the DNA duplex, and ADP and Pi release leads to translocation of the developing single strand. Thus DNA unwinding is achieved by a two-part power stroke in a combined wrench-and-inchworm mechanism. The rotational angle and translational distance of DNA define the unwinding step to be 1 base pair per ATP hydrolyzed. Finally, a gateway for ssDNA translocation and an alternative strand-displacement mode may explain the varying step sizes reported previously.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Lee","full_name":"Lee JY","initials":"JY"},{"last_name":"Yang","full_name":"Yang W","initials":"W"}],"title":"UvrD helicase unwinds DNA one base pair at a time by a two-part power stroke.","pubmed_id":"17190599","type":"J","associated_entries":"2is1, 2is2, 2is6","doi":"10.1016/j.cell.2006.10.049"}]}
