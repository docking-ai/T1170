MepR is induced by multiple cationic toxins, which are also substrates of MepA. In order to understand the gene regulatory and drug-binding mechanisms of MepR, we carried out biochemical, in vivo and structural studies. The 2.40 A resolution structure of drug-free MepR reveals the most open MarR family protein conformation to date, which will require a huge conformational change to bind cognate DNA. DNA-binding data show that MepR uses a dual regulatory binding mode as the repressor binds the mepA operator as a dimer of dimers, but binds the mepR operator as a single dimer. Alignment of the six half sites reveals the consensus MepR binding site, 5'-GTTAGAT-3'. 'Drug' binding studies show that MepR binds to ethidium and DAPI with comparable affinities (K(d) = 2.6 and 4.5 microM, respectively), but with significantly lower affinity to the larger rhodamine 6G (K(d) = 62.6 microM). Mapping clinically relevant or in vitro selected MepR mutants onto the MepR structure suggests that their defective repressor phenotypes are due to structural and allosteric defects.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Kumaraswami","full_name":"Kumaraswami M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Schuman","full_name":"Schuman JT","initials":"JT"},{"last_name":"Seo","full_name":"Seo SM","initials":"SM"},{"last_name":"Kaatz","full_name":"Kaatz GW","initials":"GW"},{"last_name":"Brennan","full_name":"Brennan RG","initials":"RG"}],"title":"Structural and biochemical characterization of MepR, a multidrug binding transcription regulator of the Staphylococcus aureus multidrug efflux pump MepA.","pubmed_id":"19129225","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1093/nar/gkn1046"}]}
