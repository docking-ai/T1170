Here, we report three cryogenic electron microscopy structures of ABCD1: the apo-form, substrate- and ATP-bound forms. Distinct from what was seen in the previously reported ABC transporters, the two symmetric molecules of behenoyl coenzyme A (C22:0-CoA) cooperatively bind to the transmembrane domains (TMDs). For each C22:0-CoA, the hydrophilic 3'-phospho-ADP moiety of CoA portion inserts into one TMD, with the succeeding pantothenate and cysteamine moiety crossing the inter-domain cavity, whereas the hydrophobic fatty acyl chain extends to the opposite TMD. Structural analysis combined with biochemical assays illustrates snapshots of ABCD1-mediated substrate transport cycle. It advances our understanding on the selective oxidation of fatty acids and molecular pathology of X-ALD.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Chen","full_name":"Chen ZP","initials":"ZP"},{"last_name":"Xu","full_name":"Xu D","initials":"D"},{"last_name":"Wang","full_name":"Wang L","initials":"L"},{"last_name":"Mao","full_name":"Mao YX","initials":"YX"},{"last_name":"Li","full_name":"Li Y","initials":"Y"},{"last_name":"Cheng","full_name":"Cheng MT","initials":"MT"},{"last_name":"Zhou","full_name":"Zhou CZ","initials":"CZ"},{"last_name":"Hou","full_name":"Hou WT","initials":"WT"},{"last_name":"Chen","full_name":"Chen Y","initials":"Y"}],"pubmed_id":"35676282","type":"J"}]}
