A member of the diphtheria toxin repressor (DtxR) family of metalloregulatory proteins, MntR exhibits selectivity for Mn2+ over Fe2+. Replacement of a metal-binding residue, Asp8, with methionine (D8M) relaxes this specificity. We report here the X-ray crystal structures of wild-type MntR and the D8M mutant bound to manganese with 1.75 A and 1.61 A resolution, respectively. The 142-residue MntR homodimer has substantial structural similarity to the 226-residue DtxR but lacks the C-terminal SH3-like domain of DtxR. The metal-binding pockets of MntR and DtxR are substantially different. The cation-to-cation distance between the two manganese ions bound by MntR is 3.3 A, whereas that between the metal ions bound by DtxR is 9 A. D8M binds only a single Mn2+ per monomer, owing to alteration of the metal-binding site. The sole retained metal site adopts pseudo-hexacoordinate geometry rather than the pseudo-heptacoordinate geometry of the MntR metal sites.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Glasfeld","full_name":"Glasfeld A","initials":"A"},{"last_name":"Guedon","full_name":"Guedon E","initials":"E"},{"last_name":"Helmann","full_name":"Helmann JD","initials":"JD"},{"last_name":"Brennan","full_name":"Brennan RG","initials":"RG"}],"title":"Structure of the manganese-bound manganese transport regulator of Bacillus subtilis.","pubmed_id":"12847518","type":"J","associated_entries":"1on1","doi":"10.1038/nsb951"}]}
