Phr specifically represses the expression of heat shock genes at physiological temperature in vitro and in vivo but is released from the promoters upon heat shock response. Structure analysis revealed a stable homodimer, each subunit consisting of an N-terminal winged helix DNA-binding domain (wH-DBD) and a C-terminal antiparallel coiled coil helical domain. The overall structure shows as a molecular chimera with significant folding similarity of its DBD to the bacterial SmtB/ArsR family, while its C-terminal part was found to be a remote homologue of the eukaryotic BAG domain. The dimeric protein recognizes a palindromic DNA sequence. Molecular docking and mutational analyses suggested a novel binding mode in which the major specific contacts occur at the minor groove interacting with the strongly basic wing containing a cluster of three arginine residues.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Liu","full_name":"Liu W","initials":"W"},{"last_name":"Vierke","full_name":"Vierke G","initials":"G"},{"last_name":"Wenke","full_name":"Wenke AK","initials":"AK"},{"last_name":"Thomm","full_name":"Thomm M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Ladenstein","full_name":"Ladenstein R","initials":"R"}],"title":"Crystal structure of the archaeal heat shock regulator from Pyrococcus furiosus: a molecular chimera representing eukaryal and bacterial features.","pubmed_id":"17434531","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1016/j.jmb.2007.03.044"}]}
