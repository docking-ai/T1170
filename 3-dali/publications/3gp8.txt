However, structural analyses to date have focused on how SF1A helicases achieve 3'-5' movement along nucleic acids. We present crystal structures of the complex between the SF1B helicase RecD2 from Deinococcus radiodurans and ssDNA in the presence and absence of an ATP analog. These snapshots of the reaction pathway reveal a nucleotide binding-induced conformational change of the two motor domains that is broadly reminiscent of changes observed in other SF1 and SF2 helicases. Together with biochemical data, the structures point to a step size for translocation of one base per ATP hydrolyzed. Moreover, the structures also reveal a mechanism for nucleic acid translocation in the 5'-3' direction by SF1B helicases that is surprisingly different from that of 3'-5' translocation by SF1A enzymes, and explains the molecular basis of directionality.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Saikrishnan","full_name":"Saikrishnan K","initials":"K"},{"last_name":"Powell","full_name":"Powell B","initials":"B"},{"last_name":"Cook","full_name":"Cook NJ","initials":"NJ"},{"last_name":"Webb","full_name":"Webb MR","initials":"MR"},{"last_name":"Wigley","full_name":"Wigley DB","initials":"DB"}],"title":"Mechanistic basis of 5'-3' translocation in SF1B helicases.","pubmed_id":"19490894","type":"J","associated_entries":"3e1s, 3gpl, 3k70","doi":"10.1016/j.cell.2009.03.036"},{"journal_info":{"volume":"27","pdb_abbreviation":"EMBO J.","ISO_abbreviation":"EMBO J.","year":2008,"issue":"16","pages":"2222-9"},"abstract":{"methods":null,"conclusions":null,"results":null,"unassigned":"The molecular mechanism of superfamily 1Balpha helicases remains unclear. We present here the crystal structure of the RecD2 helicase from Deinococcus radiodurans at 2.2-A resolution. The structure reveals the folds of the 1B and 2B domains of RecD that were poorly ordered in the structure of the Escherichia coli RecBCD enzyme complex reported previously. The 2B domain adopts an SH3 fold which, although common in eukaryotes, is extremely rare in bacterial systems. In addition, the D. radiodurans RecD2 structure has aided us in deciphering lower resolution (3.6 A) electron density maps for the E. coli RecBCD enzyme in complex with a long DNA substrate that interacts with the RecD subunit. Taken together, these structures indicated an important role for the 1B domain of RecD, a beta-hairpin that extends from the surface of the 1A domain and interacts with the DNA substrate. On the basis of these structural data, we designed a mutant RecD2 helicase that lacks this pin. The 'pin-less' mutant protein is a fully active ssDNA-dependent ATPase but totally lacks helicase activity.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Saikrishnan","full_name":"Saikrishnan K","initials":"K"},{"last_name":"Griffiths","full_name":"Griffiths SP","initials":"SP"},{"last_name":"Cook","full_name":"Cook N","initials":"N"},{"last_name":"Court","full_name":"Court R","initials":"R"},{"last_name":"Wigley","full_name":"Wigley DB","initials":"DB"}],"title":"DNA binding to RecD: role of the 1B domain in SF1B helicase activity.","pubmed_id":"18668125","type":"J","associated_entries":"3e1s, 3gpl, 3k70","doi":"10.1038/emboj.2008.144"}]}
