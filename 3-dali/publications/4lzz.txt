Small-angle solution X-ray scattering, crystallography, and electron microscopy (EM) reconstructions revealed that partial ATP occupancy caused the heptameric closed ring of the bacterial enhancer-binding protein (bEBP) NtrC1 to rearrange into a hexameric split ring of striking asymmetry. The highly conserved and functionally crucial GAFTGA loops responsible for interacting with \u03c354-RNA polymerase formed a spiral staircase. We propose that splitting of the ensemble directs ATP hydrolysis within the oligomer, and the ring's asymmetry guides interaction between ATPase and the complex of \u03c354 and promoter DNA. Similarity between the structure of the transcriptional activator NtrC1 and those of distantly related helicases Rho and E1 reveals a general mechanism in homomeric ATPases whereby complex allostery within the ring geometry forms asymmetric functional states that allow these biological motors to exert directional forces on their target macromolecules.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Sysoeva","full_name":"Sysoeva TA","initials":"TA"},{"last_name":"Chowdhury","full_name":"Chowdhury S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Guo","full_name":"Guo L","initials":"L"},{"last_name":"Nixon","full_name":"Nixon BT","initials":"BT"}],"title":"Nucleotide-induced asymmetry within ATPase activator ring drives \u03c354-RNAP interaction and ATP hydrolysis.","pubmed_id":"24240239","type":"J","associated_entries":"4ly6","doi":"10.1101/gad.229385.113"},{"journal_info":{"volume":null,"pdb_abbreviation":"To be published","ISO_abbreviation":null,"year":null,"issue":null,"pages":"-"},"abstract":{"methods":null,"conclusions":null,"results":null,"unassigned":null,"background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":null,"full_name":"Sysoeva, T.A.","initials":null},{"last_name":null,"full_name":"Yennawar, N.","initials":null},{"last_name":null,"full_name":"Allaire, M.","initials":null},{"last_name":null,"full_name":"Nixon, B.T.","initials":null}],"title":"Crystallization and preliminary X-ray analysis of a sigma54-dependent transcription activator NtrC1 from Aquifex aeolicus bound to ground state ATP analog","pubmed_id":null,"type":"U","associated_entries":"4ly6","doi":null}]}
