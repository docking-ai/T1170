The intermediate domains of HslU, which extend like tentacles from the hexameric ring formed by the amino-terminal and carboxy-terminal domains, have been deleted; an asymmetric HslU(DeltaI)(6)HslV(12) complex has been crystallized; and the structure has been solved to 2.5A resolution, revealing an assembly in which a HslU(DeltaI) hexamer binds one end of the HslV dodecamer. The conformation of the protomers of the HslU(DeltaI)-complexed HslV hexamer is similar to that in the symmetric wild-type HslUV complex, while the protomer conformation of the uncomplexed HslV hexamer is similar to that of HslV alone. Reaction in the crystals with a vinyl sulfone inhibitor reveals that the HslU(DeltaI)-complexed HslV hexamer is active, while the uncomplexed HslV hexamer is inactive. These results confirm that HslV can be activated by binding of a hexameric HslU(DeltaI)(6) ring lacking the I domains, that activation is effected through a conformational change in HslV rather than through alteration of the size of the entry channel into the protease catalytic cavity, and that the two HslV(6) rings in the protease dodecamer are activated independently rather than cooperatively.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Kwon","full_name":"Kwon AR","initials":"AR"},{"last_name":"Kessler","full_name":"Kessler BM","initials":"BM"},{"last_name":"Overkleeft","full_name":"Overkleeft HS","initials":"HS"},{"last_name":"McKay","full_name":"McKay DB","initials":"DB"}],"title":"Structure and reactivity of an asymmetric complex between HslV and I-domain deleted HslU, a prokaryotic homolog of the eukaryotic proteasome.","pubmed_id":"12823960","type":"J","associated_entries":"1g3i, 1g3k, 1kyi, 1ofh","doi":"10.1016/S0022-2836(03)00580-1"},{"journal_info":{"volume":"318","pdb_abbreviation":"J.

Here, the 3.1 A X-ray crystallographic structure of Haemophilus influenzae HslUV complexed with a vinyl sulfone inhibitor is described. The inhibitor, which reacts to form a covalent linkage to Thr1 of HslV, binds in an \"antiparallel beta\" manner, with hydrogen-bond interactions between the peptide backbone of the protease and that of the inhibitor, and with two leucinyl side chains of the inhibitor binding in the S1 and S3 specificity pockets of the protease. Comparison of the structure of the HslUV-inhibitor complex with that of HslV without inhibitor and in the absence of HslU reveals that backbone interactions would correctly position a substrate for cleavage in the HslUV complex, but not in the HslV protease alone, corroborating the proposed mechanism of allosteric activation. This activation mechanism differs from that of the eukaryotic proteasome, for which binding of activators opens a gated channel that controls access of substrates to the protease, but does not perturb the active site environment.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Sousa","full_name":"Sousa MC","initials":"MC"},{"last_name":"Kessler","full_name":"Kessler BM","initials":"BM"},{"last_name":"Overkleeft","full_name":"Overkleeft HS","initials":"HS"},{"last_name":"McKay","full_name":"McKay DB","initials":"DB"}],"title":"Crystal structure of HslUV complexed with a vinyl sulfone inhibitor: corroboration of a proposed mechanism of allosteric activation of HslV by HslU.","pubmed_id":"12054822","type":"J","associated_entries":"1g3i, 1g3k, 1kyi, 1ofh","doi":"10.1016/S0022-2836(02)00145-6"},{"journal_info":{"volume":"103","pdb_abbreviation":"Cell","ISO_abbreviation":"Cell","year":2000,"issue":"4","pages":"633-43"},"abstract":{"methods":null,"conclusions":null,"results":null,"unassigned":"HslUV is a \"prokaryotic proteasome\" composed of the HslV protease and the HslU ATPase, a chaperone of the Clp/Hsp100 family.
