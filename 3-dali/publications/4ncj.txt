Here we design structure-based mutations in Pyrococcus furiosus Rad50 to alter protein core plasticity and residues undergoing ATP-driven movements within the catalytic domains. With this strategy we identify Rad50 separation-of-function mutants that either promote or destabilize the ATP-bound state. Crystal structures, X-ray scattering, biochemical assays, and functional analyses of mutant PfRad50 complexes show that the ATP-induced 'closed' conformation promotes DNA end binding and end tethering, while hydrolysis-induced opening is essential for DNA resection. Reducing the stability of the ATP-bound state impairs DNA repair and Tel1 (ATM) checkpoint signaling in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, double-strand break resection in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and ATM activation by human Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 in vitro, supporting the generality of the P.\u00a0furiosus Rad50 structure-based mutational analyses. These collective results suggest that ATP-dependent Rad50 conformations switch the Mre11-Rad50 complex between DNA tethering, ATM signaling, and 5' strand resection, revealing molecular mechanisms regulating responses to DNA double-strand breaks.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Deshpande","full_name":"Deshpande RA","initials":"RA"},{"last_name":"Williams","full_name":"Williams GJ","initials":"GJ"},{"last_name":"Limbo","full_name":"Limbo O","initials":"O"},{"last_name":"Williams","full_name":"Williams RS","initials":"RS"},{"last_name":"Kuhnlein","full_name":"Kuhnlein J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Lee","full_name":"Lee JH","initials":"JH"},{"last_name":"Classen","full_name":"Classen S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Guenther","full_name":"Guenther G","initials":"G"},{"last_name":"Russell","full_name":"Russell P","initials":"P"},{"last_name":"Tainer","full_name":"Tainer JA","initials":"JA"},{"last_name":"Paull","full_name":"Paull TT","initials":"TT"}],"title":"ATP-driven Rad50 conformations regulate DNA tethering, end resection, and ATM checkpoint signaling.","pubmed_id":"24493214","type":"J","associated_entries":"4nch, 4nci, 4nck","doi":"10.1002/embj.201386100"}]}
