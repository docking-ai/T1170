VAT, the Thermoplasma acidophilum homologue of eukaryotic CDC48/p97, works in conjunction with the proteasome to degrade misfolded or damaged proteins. We show that in the presence of ATP, VAT with its regulatory N-terminal domains removed unfolds other VAT complexes as substrate. We captured images of this transient process by electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) to reveal the structure of the substrate-bound intermediate. Substrate binding breaks the six-fold symmetry of the complex, allowing five of the six VAT subunits to constrict into a tight helix that grips an ~80 \u00c5 stretch of unfolded protein. The structure suggests a processive hand-over-hand unfolding mechanism, where each VAT subunit releases the substrate in turn before re-engaging further along the target protein, thereby unfolding it.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Ripstein","full_name":"Ripstein ZA","initials":"ZA"},{"last_name":"Huang","full_name":"Huang R","initials":"R"},{"last_name":"Augustyniak","full_name":"Augustyniak R","initials":"R"},{"last_name":"Kay","full_name":"Kay LE","initials":"LE"},{"last_name":"Rubinstein","full_name":"Rubinstein JL","initials":"JL"}],"title":"Structure of a AAA+ unfoldase in the process of unfolding substrate.","pubmed_id":"28390173","type":"J","associated_entries":"5vc7","doi":"10.7554/eLife.25754"}]}
