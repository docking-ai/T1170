Here, we show both in human cells and in mice that RuvB-like ATPase 2 (RUVBL2) interacts with other known clock proteins on chromatin to regulate the circadian phase. Pharmacological perturbation of RUVBL2 with the adenosine analog compound cordycepin resulted in a rapid-onset 12-hour clock phase-shift phenotype at human cell, mouse tissue, and whole-animal live imaging levels. Using simple peripheral injection treatment, we found that cordycepin penetrated the blood-brain barrier and caused rapid entrainment of the circadian phase, facilitating reduced duration of recovery in a mouse jet-lag model. We solved a crystal structure for human RUVBL2 in complex with a physiological metabolite of cordycepin, and biochemical assays showed that cordycepin treatment caused disassembly of an interaction between RUVBL2 and the core clock component BMAL1. Moreover, we showed with spike-in ChIP-seq analysis and binding assays that cordycepin treatment caused disassembly of the circadian super-complex, which normally resides at E-box chromatin loci such as <i>PER1</i>, <i>PER2</i>, <i>DBP,</i> and <i>NR1D1</i> Mathematical modeling supported that the observed type 0 phase shifts resulted from derepression of E-box clock gene transcription.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Ju","full_name":"Ju D","initials":"D"},{"last_name":"Zhang","full_name":"Zhang W","initials":"W"},{"last_name":"Yan","full_name":"Yan J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Zhao","full_name":"Zhao H","initials":"H"},{"last_name":"Li","full_name":"Li W","initials":"W"},{"last_name":"Wang","full_name":"Wang J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Liao","full_name":"Liao M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Xu","full_name":"Xu Z","initials":"Z"},{"last_name":"Wang","full_name":"Wang Z","initials":"Z"},{"last_name":"Zhou","full_name":"Zhou G","initials":"G"},{"last_name":"Mei","full_name":"Mei L","initials":"L"},{"last_name":"Hou","full_name":"Hou N","initials":"N"},{"last_name":"Ying","full_name":"Ying S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Cai","full_name":"Cai T","initials":"T"},{"last_name":"Chen","full_name":"Chen S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Xie","full_name":"Xie X","initials":"X"},{"last_name":"Lai","full_name":"Lai L","initials":"L"},{"last_name":"Tang","full_name":"Tang C","initials":"C"},{"last_name":"Park","full_name":"Park N","initials":"N"},{"last_name":"Takahashi","full_name":"Takahashi JS","initials":"JS"},{"last_name":"Huang","full_name":"Huang N","initials":"N"},{"last_name":"Qi","full_name":"Qi X","initials":"X"},{"last_name":"Zhang","full_name":"Zhang EE","initials":"EE"}],"title":"Chemical perturbations reveal that RUVBL2 regulates the circadian phase in mammals.","pubmed_id":"32376767","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1126/scitranslmed.aba0769"}]}
