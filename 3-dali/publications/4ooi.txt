Here we report the crystal structure of HlyU from V. cholerae N16961 (HlyU_Vc) at 1.8\u00c5. The protein, with five \u03b1-helices and three \u03b2-strands in the topology of \u03b11-\u03b12-\u03b21-\u03b13-\u03b14-\u03b22-\u03b23-\u03b15, forms a homodimer. Helices \u03b13-\u03b14 and a \u03b2 sheet form the winged helix-turn-helix (wHTH) DNA-binding motif common to the transcription regulators of the SmtB/ArsR family. In spite of an overall fold similar to SmtB/ArsR family, it lacks any metal binding site seen in SmtB. A comparison of the dimeric interfaces showed that the one in SmtB is much larger and have salt bridges that can be disrupted to accommodate metal ions. A model of HlyU-DNA complex suggests bending of the DNA. Cys38 in the structure was found to be modified as sulfenic acid; the oxidized form was not seen in another structure solved under reducing condition. Although devoid of any metal binding site, the presence of a Cys residue exhibiting oxidation-reduction suggests the possibility of the existence of a redox switch in transcription regulation. A structure-based phylogenetic analysis of wHTH proteins revealed the segregation of metal and non-metal binding proteins as well as those in the latter group that are under redox control.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Mukherjee","full_name":"Mukherjee D","initials":"D"},{"last_name":"Datta","full_name":"Datta AB","initials":"AB"},{"last_name":"Chakrabarti","full_name":"Chakrabarti P","initials":"P"}],"pubmed_id":"25450504","type":"J"}]}
