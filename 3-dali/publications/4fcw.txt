How ClpB harnesses the energy of ATP binding and hydrolysis to facilitate the mechanical unfolding of previously aggregated, stress-damaged proteins remains unclear. Here, we present crystal structures of the ClpB D2 domain in the nucleotide-bound and -free states, and the fitted cryoEM structure of the D2 hexamer ring, which provide a structural understanding of the ATP power stroke that drives protein translocation through the ClpB hexamer. We demonstrate that the conformation of the substrate-translocating pore loop is coupled to the nucleotide state of the cis subunit, which is transmitted to the neighboring subunit via a conserved but structurally distinct intersubunit-signaling pathway common to diverse AAA+ machines. Furthermore, we found that an engineered, disulfide cross-linked ClpB hexamer is fully functional biochemically, suggesting that ClpB deoligomerization is not required for protein disaggregation.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Biter","full_name":"Biter AB","initials":"AB"},{"last_name":"Lee","full_name":"Lee S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Sung","full_name":"Sung N","initials":"N"},{"last_name":"Tsai","full_name":"Tsai FT","initials":"FT"}],"pubmed_id":"22802670","type":"J"}]}
