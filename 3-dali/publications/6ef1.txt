The hetero-hexameric ATPase motor of the proteasome unfolds and translocates targeted protein substrates into the open gate of a proteolytic core, while a proteasomal deubiquitinase concomitantly removes substrate-attached ubiquitin chains. However, the mechanisms by which ATP hydrolysis drives the conformational changes responsible for these processes have remained elusive. Here we present the cryo-EM structures of four distinct conformational states of the actively ATP-hydrolyzing, substrate-engaged 26<i>S</i> proteasome. These structures reveal how mechanical substrate translocation accelerates deubiquitination, and how ATP-binding, hydrolysis, and phosphate-release events are coordinated within the AAA+ motor to induce conformational changes and propel the substrate through the central pore.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"de la Pe\u00f1a","full_name":"de la Pe\u00f1a AH","initials":"AH"},{"last_name":"Goodall","full_name":"Goodall EA","initials":"EA"},{"last_name":"Gates","full_name":"Gates SN","initials":"SN"},{"last_name":"Lander","full_name":"Lander GC","initials":"GC"},{"last_name":"Martin","full_name":"Martin A","initials":"A"}],"title":"Substrate-engaged 26<i>S</i> proteasome structures reveal mechanisms for ATP-hydrolysis-driven translocation.","pubmed_id":"30309908","type":"J","associated_entries":"6ef0, 6ef2, 6ef3","doi":"10.1126/science.aav0725"}]}
