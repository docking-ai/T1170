However, the structural basis explaining their substrate specificity and the enzymatic mechanism is elusive. Here, we report crystal structures of Clp1 from Caenorhabditis elegans (ceClp1) in a number of nucleotide- and RNA-bound states along the reaction pathway. The combined structural and biochemical analysis of ceClp1 elucidates the RNA specificity and lets us derive a general model for enzyme catalysis of RNA-specific polynucleotide kinases. We identified an RNA binding motif referred to as \"clasp\" as well as a conformational switch that involves the essential Walker A lysine (Lys127) and regulates the enzymatic activity of ceClp1. Structural comparison with other P loop proteins, such as kinases, adenosine triphosphatases (ATPases), and guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases), suggests that the observed conformational switch of the Walker A lysine is a broadly relevant mechanistic feature.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Dikfidan","full_name":"Dikfidan A","initials":"A"},{"last_name":"Loll","full_name":"Loll B","initials":"B"},{"last_name":"Zeymer","full_name":"Zeymer C","initials":"C"},{"last_name":"Magler","full_name":"Magler I","initials":"I"},{"last_name":"Clausen","full_name":"Clausen T","initials":"T"},{"last_name":"Meinhart","full_name":"Meinhart A","initials":"A"}],"pubmed_id":"24813946","type":"J"}]}
