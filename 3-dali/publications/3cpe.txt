We report the crystal structure of the DNA packaging motor protein, gene product 17 (gp17), in bacteriophage T4. The structure consists of an N-terminal ATPase domain, which provides energy for compacting DNA, and a C-terminal nuclease domain, which terminates packaging. We show that another function of the C-terminal domain is to translocate the genome into the procapsid. The two domains are in close contact in the crystal structure, representing a \"tensed state.\" A cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction of the T4 procapsid complexed with gp17 shows that the packaging motor is a pentamer and that the domains within each monomer are spatially separated, representing a \"relaxed state.\" These structures suggest a mechanism, supported by mutational and other data, in which electrostatic forces drive the DNA packaging by alternating between tensed and relaxed states. Similar mechanisms may occur in other molecular motors.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Sun","full_name":"Sun S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Kondabagil","full_name":"Kondabagil K","initials":"K"},{"last_name":"Draper","full_name":"Draper B","initials":"B"},{"last_name":"Alam","full_name":"Alam TI","initials":"TI"},{"last_name":"Bowman","full_name":"Bowman VD","initials":"VD"},{"last_name":"Zhang","full_name":"Zhang Z","initials":"Z"},{"last_name":"Hegde","full_name":"Hegde S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Fokine","full_name":"Fokine A","initials":"A"},{"last_name":"Rossmann","full_name":"Rossmann MG","initials":"MG"},{"last_name":"Rao","full_name":"Rao VB","initials":"VB"}],"pubmed_id":"19109896","type":"J"}]}
