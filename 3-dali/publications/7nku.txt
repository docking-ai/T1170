Drg1 monomers contain two AAA-domains (D1 and D2) that act in a concerted manner. Rlp24 release is inhibited by the drug diazaborine which blocks ATP hydrolysis in D2. The mode of inhibition was unknown. Here we show the first cryo-EM structure of Drg1 revealing the inhibitory mechanism. Diazaborine forms a covalent bond to the 2'-OH of the nucleotide in D2, explaining its specificity for this site. As a consequence, the D2 domain is locked in a rigid, inactive state, stalling the whole Drg1 hexamer. Resistance mechanisms identified include abolished drug binding and altered positioning of the nucleotide. Our results suggest nucleotide-modifying compounds as potential novel inhibitors for AAA-ATPases.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Prattes","full_name":"Prattes M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Grishkovskaya","full_name":"Grishkovskaya I","initials":"I"},{"last_name":"Hodirnau","full_name":"Hodirnau VV","initials":"VV"},{"last_name":"R\u00f6ssler","full_name":"R\u00f6ssler I","initials":"I"},{"last_name":"Klein","full_name":"Klein I","initials":"I"},{"last_name":"Hetzmannseder","full_name":"Hetzmannseder C","initials":"C"},{"last_name":"Zisser","full_name":"Zisser G","initials":"G"},{"last_name":"Gruber","full_name":"Gruber CC","initials":"CC"},{"last_name":"Gruber","full_name":"Gruber K","initials":"K"},{"last_name":"Haselbach","full_name":"Haselbach D","initials":"D"},{"last_name":"Bergler","full_name":"Bergler H","initials":"H"}],"title":"Structural basis for inhibition of the AAA-ATPase Drg1 by diazaborine.","pubmed_id":"34108481","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1038/s41467-021-23854-x"}]}
