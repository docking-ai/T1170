Crystal structures of ADP- and ATP-bound Aquifex aeolicus PilT at 2.8 and 3.2 A resolution show N-terminal PAS-like and C-terminal RecA-like ATPase domains followed by a set of short C-terminal helices. The hexamer is formed by extensive polar subunit interactions between the ATPase core of one monomer and the N-terminal domain of the next. An additional structure captures a nonsymmetric PilT hexamer in which approach of invariant arginines from two subunits to the bound nucleotide forms an enzymatically competent active site. A panel of pilT mutations highlights the importance of the arginines, the PAS-like domain, the polar subunit interface, and the C-terminal helices for retraction. We present a model for ATP binding leading to dramatic PilT domain motions, engagement of the arginine wire, and subunit communication in this hexameric motor. Our conclusions apply to the entire type II/IV secretion ATPase family.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Satyshur","full_name":"Satyshur KA","initials":"KA"},{"last_name":"Worzalla","full_name":"Worzalla GA","initials":"GA"},{"last_name":"Meyer","full_name":"Meyer LS","initials":"LS"},{"last_name":"Heiniger","full_name":"Heiniger EK","initials":"EK"},{"last_name":"Aukema","full_name":"Aukema KG","initials":"KG"},{"last_name":"Misic","full_name":"Misic AM","initials":"AM"},{"last_name":"Forest","full_name":"Forest KT","initials":"KT"}],"title":"Crystal structures of the pilus retraction motor PilT suggest large domain movements and subunit cooperation drive motility.","pubmed_id":"17355871","type":"J","associated_entries":"2eww, 2eyu, 2gsz","doi":"10.1016/j.str.2007.01.018"},{"journal_info":{"volume":"60","pdb_abbreviation":"Acta Crystallogr.

Nesseria gonorrhoeae PilT has been purified and its ultrastructure has been examined by freeze-etch electron microscopy, revealing a 115 A outer diameter, 15-35 A inner diameter ring. Aquifex aeolicus PilT crystals were obtained in a primitive hexagonal space group (unit-cell parameters a = b = 107.3, c = 68.5 A) and diffract to a minimum Bragg spacing of 2.8 A when PilT is co-crystallized with adenine nucleotides. Initial phases to 3.5 A resolution have been determined by multiwavelength anomalous dispersion and density modification. Resulting electron-density maps show a hexameric A. aeolicus PilT ring 105 A wide by 55 A high, with an inner cavity that varies in shape and width from 20 to 40 A over the height of the complex. Both PilT ultrastructures are very similar to type II and type IV secretion ATPases in overall shape, size and assembly.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Forest","full_name":"Forest KT","initials":"KT"},{"last_name":"Satyshur","full_name":"Satyshur KA","initials":"KA"},{"last_name":"Worzalla","full_name":"Worzalla GA","initials":"GA"},{"last_name":"Hansen","full_name":"Hansen JK","initials":"JK"},{"last_name":"Herdendorf","full_name":"Herdendorf TJ","initials":"TJ"}],"title":"The pilus-retraction protein PilT: ultrastructure of the biological assembly.","pubmed_id":"15103158","type":"J","associated_entries":"2eww, 2eyu, 2gsz","doi":"10.1107/S0907444904006055"}]}
