Comparative studies provide insights into the functional consequences of specific changes. Here we present structural and biochemical studies of NtrC4, a sigma-54 activator from Aquifex aeolicus, and compare it with NtrC1 (a paralog) and NtrC (a homolog from Salmonella enterica) to provide insight into how a substantial change in regulatory mechanism may have occurred. Activity assays show that assembly of NtrC4's active oligomer is repressed by the N-terminal receiver domain, and that BeF3- addition (mimicking phosphorylation) removes this repression. Observation of assembly without activation for NtrC4 indicates that it is much less strongly repressed than NtrC1. The crystal structure of the unactivated receiver-ATPase domain combination shows a partially disrupted interface. NMR structures of the regulatory domain show that its activation mechanism is very similar to that of NtrC1. The crystal structure of the NtrC4 DNA-binding domain shows that it is dimeric and more similar in structure to NtrC than NtrC1. Electron microscope images of the ATPase-DNA-binding domain combination show formation of oligomeric rings. Sequence alignments provide insights into the distribution of activation mechanisms in this family of proteins.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Batchelor","full_name":"Batchelor JD","initials":"JD"},{"last_name":"Doucleff","full_name":"Doucleff M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Lee","full_name":"Lee CJ","initials":"CJ"},{"last_name":"Matsubara","full_name":"Matsubara K","initials":"K"},{"last_name":"De Carlo","full_name":"De Carlo S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Heideker","full_name":"Heideker J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Lamers","full_name":"Lamers MH","initials":"MH"},{"last_name":"Pelton","full_name":"Pelton JG","initials":"JG"},{"last_name":"Wemmer","full_name":"Wemmer DE","initials":"DE"}],"title":"Structure and regulatory mechanism of Aquifex aeolicus NtrC4: variability and evolution in bacterial transcriptional regulation.","pubmed_id":"18955063","type":"J","associated_entries":"3e7l","doi":"10.1016/j.jmb.2008.10.024"}]}
