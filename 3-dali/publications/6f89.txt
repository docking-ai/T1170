The first step of the biosynthesis of t6A, the production of threonyl-carbamoyl adenylate (TC-AMP), is catalyzed by the Sua5/TsaC family of enzymes. While TsaC is a single domain protein, Sua5 enzymes are composed of the TsaC-like domain, a linker and an extra domain called SUA5 of unknown function. In the present study, we report structure-function analysis of Pyrococcus abyssi Sua5 (Pa-Sua5). Crystallographic data revealed binding sites for bicarbonate substrate and pyrophosphate product. The linker of Pa-Sua5 forms a loop structure that folds into the active site gorge and closes it. Using structure-guided mutational analysis we established that the conserved sequence motifs in the linker and the domain-domain interface are essential for the function of Pa-Sua5. We propose that the linker participates actively in the biosynthesis of TC-AMP by binding to ATP/PPi and by stabilizing the N-carboxy-L-threonine intermediate. Hence, TsaC orthologs which lack such a linker and SUA5 domain use different mechanism for TC-AMP synthesis.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Pichard-Kostuch","full_name":"Pichard-Kostuch A","initials":"A"},{"last_name":"Zhang","full_name":"Zhang W","initials":"W"},{"last_name":"Liger","full_name":"Liger D","initials":"D"},{"last_name":"Daugeron","full_name":"Daugeron MC","initials":"MC"},{"last_name":"Letoquart","full_name":"Letoquart J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Li de la Sierra-Gallay","full_name":"Li de la Sierra-Gallay I","initials":"I"},{"last_name":"Forterre","full_name":"Forterre P","initials":"P"},{"last_name":"Collinet","full_name":"Collinet B","initials":"B"},{"last_name":"van Tilbeurgh","full_name":"van Tilbeurgh H","initials":"H"},{"last_name":"Basta","full_name":"Basta T","initials":"T"}],"title":"Structure-function analysis of Sua5 protein reveals novel functional motifs required for the biosynthesis of the universal t6A tRNA modification.","pubmed_id":"29650678","type":"J","associated_entries":"6f87, 6f8y","doi":"10.1261/rna.066092.118"}]}
