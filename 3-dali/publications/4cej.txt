These enzyme complexes unwind and digest the DNA duplex from the broken end until they encounter a \u03c7 sequence, whereupon they produce a 3' single-stranded DNA tail onto which they initiate loading of the RecA protein. Consequently, regulation of the AddAB/RecBCD complex by \u03c7 is a key control point in DNA repair and other processes involving genetic recombination. Here we report crystal structures of Bacillus subtilis AddAB in complex with different \u03c7-containing DNA substrates either with or without a non-hydrolysable ATP analogue. Comparison of these structures suggests a mechanism for DNA translocation and unwinding, suggests how the enzyme binds specifically to \u03c7 sequences, and explains how \u03c7 recognition leads to the arrest of AddAB (and RecBCD) translocation that is observed in single-molecule experiments.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Krajewski","full_name":"Krajewski WW","initials":"WW"},{"last_name":"Fu","full_name":"Fu X","initials":"X"},{"last_name":"Wilkinson","full_name":"Wilkinson M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Cronin","full_name":"Cronin NB","initials":"NB"},{"last_name":"Dillingham","full_name":"Dillingham MS","initials":"MS"},{"last_name":"Wigley","full_name":"Wigley DB","initials":"DB"}],"title":"Structural basis for translocation by AddAB helicase-nuclease and its arrest at \u03c7 sites.","pubmed_id":"24670664","type":"J","associated_entries":"4ceh, 4cei","doi":"10.1038/nature13037"}]}
