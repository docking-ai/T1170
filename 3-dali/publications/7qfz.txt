As a result, bacteria have evolved a multitude of systems that protect from attack. Genes encoding bacterial defence mechanisms can be clustered into 'defence islands', providing a potentially synergistic level of protection against a wider range of assailants. However, there is a comparative paucity of information on how expression of these defence systems is controlled. Here, we functionally characterize a transcriptional regulator, BrxR, encoded within a recently described phage defence island from a multidrug resistant plasmid of the emerging pathogen Escherichia fergusonii. Using a combination of reporters and electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we discovered that BrxR acts as a repressor. We present the structure of BrxR to 2.15 \u00c5, the first structure of this family of transcription factors, and pinpoint a likely binding site for ligands within the WYL-domain. Bioinformatic analyses demonstrated that BrxR-family homologues are widespread amongst bacteria. About half (48%) of identified BrxR homologues were co-localized with a diverse array of known phage defence systems, either alone or clustered into defence islands. BrxR is a novel regulator that reveals a common mechanism for controlling the expression of the bacterial phage defence arsenal.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Picton","full_name":"Picton DM","initials":"DM"},{"last_name":"Harling-Lee","full_name":"Harling-Lee JD","initials":"JD"},{"last_name":"Duffner","full_name":"Duffner SJ","initials":"SJ"},{"last_name":"Went","full_name":"Went SC","initials":"SC"},{"last_name":"Morgan","full_name":"Morgan RD","initials":"RD"},{"last_name":"Hinton","full_name":"Hinton JCD","initials":"JCD"},{"last_name":"Blower","full_name":"Blower TR","initials":"TR"}],"title":"A widespread family of WYL-domain transcriptional regulators co-localizes with diverse phage defence systems and islands.","pubmed_id":"35544231","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1093/nar/gkac334"}]}
