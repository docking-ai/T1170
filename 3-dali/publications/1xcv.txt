Structure determination has shown that there are two metal ion binding sites per repressor monomer, and site-directed mutagenesis has demonstrated that binding site 2 (primary) is essential for recognition of the target DNA repressor, leaving the role of binding site 1 (ancillary) unclear. Calorimetric techniques have demonstrated that although binding site 1 (ancillary) has high affinity for metal ion with a binding constant of 2 x 10(-7), binding site 2 (primary) is a low-affinity binding site with a binding constant of 6.3 x 10(-4). These two binding sites act in an independent fashion, and their contribution can be easily dissected by traditional mutational analysis. Our results clearly demonstrate that binding site 1 (ancillary) is the first one to be occupied during metal ion activation, playing a critical role in stabilization of the repressor. In addition, structural data obtained for the mutants Ni-DtxR(H79A,C102D), reported here, and the previously reported DtxR(H79A) have allowed us to propose a mechanism of metal activation for DtxR.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"D'Aquino","full_name":"D'Aquino JA","initials":"JA"},{"last_name":"Tetenbaum-Novatt","full_name":"Tetenbaum-Novatt J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"White","full_name":"White A","initials":"A"},{"last_name":"Berkovitch","full_name":"Berkovitch F","initials":"F"},{"last_name":"Ringe","full_name":"Ringe D","initials":"D"}],"title":"Mechanism of metal ion activation of the diphtheria toxin repressor DtxR.","pubmed_id":"16352732","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1073/pnas.0500908102"}]}
