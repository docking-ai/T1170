It remains elusive how conformational changes of the AAA-ATPase unfoldase in the regulatory particle (RP) control the gating of the substrate-translocation channel leading to the proteolytic chamber of the core particle (CP). Here we report three alternative states of the ATP-\u03b3-S-bound human proteasome, in which the CP gates are asymmetrically open, visualized by cryo-EM at near-atomic resolutions. At least four nucleotides are bound to the AAA-ATPase ring in these open-gate states. Variation in nucleotide binding gives rise to an axial movement of the pore loops narrowing the substrate-translation channel, which exhibit remarkable structural transitions between the spiral-staircase and saddle-shaped-circle topologies. Gate opening in the CP is thus regulated by nucleotide-driven conformational changes of the AAA-ATPase unfoldase. These findings demonstrate an elegant mechanism of allosteric coordination among sub-machines within the human proteasome holoenzyme.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Zhu","full_name":"Zhu Y","initials":"Y"},{"last_name":"Wang","full_name":"Wang WL","initials":"WL"},{"last_name":"Yu","full_name":"Yu D","initials":"D"},{"last_name":"Ouyang","full_name":"Ouyang Q","initials":"Q"},{"last_name":"Lu","full_name":"Lu Y","initials":"Y"},{"last_name":"Mao","full_name":"Mao Y","initials":"Y"}],"pubmed_id":"29636472","type":"J"}]}
