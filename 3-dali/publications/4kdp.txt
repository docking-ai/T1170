The absence of TcaR increases poly-N-acetylglucosamine production and promotes biofilm formation. Until recently, the mechanism of multiple antibiotic resistance regulator family protein members, such as TcaR, was restricted to binding double-stranded DNA. However, we recently found that TcaR strongly interacts with single-stranded DNA, which is a new role for this family of proteins. In this study, we report Staphylococcus epidermidis TcaR-single-stranded DNA complex structures. Our model suggests that TcaR and single-stranded DNA form a 61-symmetry polymer composed of TcaR dimers with single-stranded DNA that wraps outside the polymer and 12 nt per TcaR dimer. Single-stranded DNA binding to TcaR involves a large conformational change at the DNA binding lobe. Several point mutations involving the single-stranded DNA binding surface validate interactions between single-stranded DNA and TcaR. Our results extend the novel role of multiple antibiotic resistance regulator family proteins in staphylococci.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Chang","full_name":"Chang YM","initials":"YM"},{"last_name":"Ho","full_name":"Ho CH","initials":"CH"},{"last_name":"Chen","full_name":"Chen CK","initials":"CK"},{"last_name":"Maestre-Reyna","full_name":"Maestre-Reyna M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Chang-Chien","full_name":"Chang-Chien MW","initials":"MW"},{"last_name":"Wang","full_name":"Wang AH","initials":"AH"}],"title":"TcaR-ssDNA complex crystal structure reveals new DNA binding mechanism of the MarR family proteins.","pubmed_id":"24531929","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1093/nar/gku128"}]}
