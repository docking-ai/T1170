We have determined two structures of Rho complexed with nucleic acid recognition site mimics in both free and nucleotide bound states to 3.0 A resolution. Both structures show that Rho forms a hexameric ring in which two RNA binding sites--a primary one responsible for target mRNA recognition and a secondary one required for mRNA translocation and unwinding--point toward the center of the ring. Rather than forming a closed ring, the Rho hexamer is split open, resembling a \"lock washer\" in its global architecture. The distance between subunits at the opening is sufficiently wide (12 A) to accommodate single-stranded RNA. This open configuration most likely resembles a state poised to load onto mRNA and suggests how related ring-shaped enzymes may be breached to bind nucleic acids.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Skordalakes","full_name":"Skordalakes E","initials":"E"},{"last_name":"Berger","full_name":"Berger JM","initials":"JM"}],"pubmed_id":"12859904","type":"J"}]}
