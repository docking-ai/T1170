Because of a lack of known 3D structures for these enzymes, their mechanism of action has remained poorly understood. Here we report the X-ray crystal structure of the monomeric AAA katanin module from Caenorhabditis elegans and cryo-EM reconstructions of the hexamer in two conformations. The structures reveal an unexpected asymmetric arrangement of the AAA domains mediated by structural elements unique to microtubule-severing enzymes and critical for their function. The reconstructions show that katanin cycles between open spiral and closed ring conformations, depending on the ATP occupancy of a gating protomer that tenses or relaxes interprotomer interfaces. Cycling of the hexamer between these conformations would provide the power stroke for microtubule severing.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Zehr","full_name":"Zehr E","initials":"E"},{"last_name":"Szyk","full_name":"Szyk A","initials":"A"},{"last_name":"Piszczek","full_name":"Piszczek G","initials":"G"},{"last_name":"Szczesna","full_name":"Szczesna E","initials":"E"},{"last_name":"Zuo","full_name":"Zuo X","initials":"X"},{"last_name":"Roll-Mecak","full_name":"Roll-Mecak A","initials":"A"}],"pubmed_id":"28783150","type":"J"}]}
