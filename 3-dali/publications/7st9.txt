However, the basis for 9-1-1's recruitment to 5' junctions is unclear. Here, we present structures of the yeast checkpoint clamp loader, Rad24-replication factor C (RFC), in complex with 9-1-1 and a 5' junction and in a post-ATP-hydrolysis state. Unexpectedly, 9-1-1 adopts both closed and planar open states in the presence of Rad24-RFC and DNA. Moreover, Rad24-RFC associates with the DNA junction in the opposite orientation of processivity clamp loaders with Rad24 exclusively coordinating the double-stranded region. ATP hydrolysis stimulates conformational changes in Rad24-RFC, leading to disengagement of DNA-loaded 9-1-1. Together, these structures explain 9-1-1's recruitment to 5' junctions and reveal new principles of sliding clamp loading.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Castaneda","full_name":"Castaneda JC","initials":"JC"},{"last_name":"Schrecker","full_name":"Schrecker M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Remus","full_name":"Remus D","initials":"D"},{"last_name":"Hite","full_name":"Hite RK","initials":"RK"}],"title":"Mechanisms of loading and release of the 9-1-1 checkpoint clamp.","pubmed_id":"35314831","type":"J","associated_entries":"7stb, 7ste","doi":"10.1038/s41594-022-00741-7"}]}
