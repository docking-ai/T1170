In most cases the enzyme exhibits a tendency to become inhibited by its substrate RuBP and other sugar phosphates. The inhibition is counteracted by diverse molecular chaperones known as Rubisco activases (Rcas). In some chemoautotrophic bacteria, the CbbQO-type Rca Q2O2 repairs inhibited active sites of hexameric form II Rubisco. The 2.2-\u00c5 crystal structure of the MoxR AAA+ protein CbbQ2 from <i>Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans</i> reveals the helix 2 insert (H2I) that is critical for Rca function and forms the axial pore of the CbbQ hexamer. Negative-stain electron microscopy shows that the essential CbbO adaptor protein binds to the conserved, concave side of the CbbQ2 hexamer. Site-directed mutagenesis supports a model in which adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP)-powered movements of the H2I are transmitted to CbbO via the concave residue L85. The basal ATPase activity of Q2O2 Rca is repressed but strongly stimulated by inhibited Rubisco. The characterization of multiple variants where this repression is released indicates that binding of inhibited Rubisco to the C-terminal CbbO VWA domain initiates a signal toward the CbbQ active site that is propagated via elements that include the CbbQ \u03b14-\u03b24 loop, pore loop 1, and the presensor 1-\u03b2 hairpin (PS1-\u03b2H). Detailed mechanistic insights into the enzyme repair chaperones of the highly diverse CO<sub>2</sub> fixation machinery of Proteobacteria will facilitate their successful implementation in synthetic biology ventures.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Tsai","full_name":"Tsai YC","initials":"YC"},{"last_name":"Ye","full_name":"Ye F","initials":"F"},{"last_name":"Liew","full_name":"Liew L","initials":"L"},{"last_name":"Liu","full_name":"Liu D","initials":"D"},{"last_name":"Bhushan","full_name":"Bhushan S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Gao","full_name":"Gao YG","initials":"YG"},{"last_name":"Mueller-Cajar","full_name":"Mueller-Cajar O","initials":"O"}],"pubmed_id":"31848241","type":"J"}]}
