Cohesin's kleisin subunit Scc1 completes the ring, connecting the ABC-like ATPase heads of a V-shaped Smc1/3 heterodimer. Proteolytic cleavage of Scc1 by separase triggers sister chromatid disjunction, presumably by breaking the Scc1 bridge. One half of the SMC-kleisin bridge is revealed here by a crystal structure of Smc1's ATPase complexed with Scc1's C-terminal domain. The latter forms a winged helix that binds a pair of beta strands in Smc1's ATPase head. Mutation of conserved residues within the contact interface destroys Scc1's interaction with Smc1/3 heterodimers and eliminates cohesin function. Interaction of Scc1's N terminus with Smc3 depends on prior C terminus connection with Smc1. There is little or no turnover of Smc1-Scc1 interactions within cohesin complexes in vivo because expression of noncleavable Scc1 after DNA replication does not hinder anaphase.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Haering","full_name":"Haering CH","initials":"CH"},{"last_name":"Schoffnegger","full_name":"Schoffnegger D","initials":"D"},{"last_name":"Nishino","full_name":"Nishino T","initials":"T"},{"last_name":"Helmhart","full_name":"Helmhart W","initials":"W"},{"last_name":"Nasmyth","full_name":"Nasmyth K","initials":"K"},{"last_name":"L\u00f6we","full_name":"L\u00f6we J","initials":"J"}],"title":"Structure and stability of cohesin's Smc1-kleisin interaction.","pubmed_id":"15383284","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1016/j.molcel.2004.08.030"}]}
