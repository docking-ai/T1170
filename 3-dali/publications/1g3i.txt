The 3.4 A crystal structure of an HslUV complex is presented here. Two hexameric ATP binding rings of HslU bind intimately to opposite sides of the HslV protease; the HslU \"intermediate domains\" extend outward from the complex. The solution structure of HslUV, derived from small angle X-ray scattering data under conditions where the complex is assembled and active, agrees with this crystallographic structure. When the complex forms, the carboxy-terminal helices of HslU distend and bind between subunits of HslV, and the apical helices of HslV shift substantially, transmitting a conformational change to the active site region of the protease.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Sousa","full_name":"Sousa MC","initials":"MC"},{"last_name":"Trame","full_name":"Trame CB","initials":"CB"},{"last_name":"Tsuruta","full_name":"Tsuruta H","initials":"H"},{"last_name":"Wilbanks","full_name":"Wilbanks SM","initials":"SM"},{"last_name":"Reddy","full_name":"Reddy VS","initials":"VS"},{"last_name":"McKay","full_name":"McKay DB","initials":"DB"}],"title":"Crystal and solution structures of an HslUV protease-chaperone complex.","pubmed_id":"11106733","type":"J","associated_entries":"1g3k","doi":"10.1016/S0092-8674(00)00166-5"}]}
