It interacts with RecO and RecR to initiate homologous recombination by loading RecA recombinases on single-stranded DNA and displacing single-stranded DNA-binding proteins. As an ATP-binding cassette ATPase, RecF exhibits ATP-dependent dimerization and structural homology with Rad50 and SMC proteins. However, the mechanism and action pattern of RecF ATP-dependent dimerization remains unclear. Here, We determined three crystal structures of TTERecF, TTERecF-ATP and TTERecF-ATP\u0264S from Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis that reveal a novel ATP-driven RecF dimerization. RecF contains a positively charged tunnel on its dimer interface that is essential to ATP binding. Our structural and biochemical data indicate that the Walker A motif serves as a switch and plays a key role in ATP binding and RecF dimerization. Furthermore, Biolayer interferometry assay results showed that the TTERecF interacted with ATP and formed a dimer, displaying a higher affinity for DNA than that of the TTERecF monomer. Overall, our results provide a solid structural basis for understanding the process of RecF binding with ATP and the functional mechanism of ATP-dependent RecF dimerization.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Tang","full_name":"Tang Q","initials":"Q"},{"last_name":"Liu","full_name":"Liu YP","initials":"YP"},{"last_name":"Shan","full_name":"Shan HH","initials":"HH"},{"last_name":"Tian","full_name":"Tian LF","initials":"LF"},{"last_name":"Zhang","full_name":"Zhang JZ","initials":"JZ"},{"last_name":"Yan","full_name":"Yan XX","initials":"XX"}],"title":"ATP-dependent conformational change in ABC-ATPase RecF serves as a switch in DNA repair.","pubmed_id":"29391496","type":"J","associated_entries":"5z67, 5z69","doi":"10.1038/s41598-018-20557-0"}]}
