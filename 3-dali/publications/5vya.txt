The Hsp104 disaggregase from S. cerevisiae solubilizes stress-induced amorphous aggregates and amyloid. The structural basis for substrate recognition and translocation is unknown. Using a model substrate (casein), we report cryo-EM structures at near-atomic resolution of Hsp104 in different translocation states. Substrate interactions are mediated by conserved, pore-loop tyrosines that contact an 80 \u00c5-long unfolded polypeptide along the axial channel. Two protomers undergo a ratchet-like conformational change that advances pore-loop-substrate interactions by two-amino acids. These changes are coupled to activation of specific ATPase sites and, when transmitted around the hexamer, reveal a processive rotary translocation mechanism and a remarkable flexibility in Hsp104-catalyzed disaggregation.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Gates","full_name":"Gates SN","initials":"SN"},{"last_name":"Yokom","full_name":"Yokom AL","initials":"AL"},{"last_name":"Lin","full_name":"Lin J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Jackrel","full_name":"Jackrel ME","initials":"ME"},{"last_name":"Rizo","full_name":"Rizo AN","initials":"AN"},{"last_name":"Kendsersky","full_name":"Kendsersky NM","initials":"NM"},{"last_name":"Buell","full_name":"Buell CE","initials":"CE"},{"last_name":"Sweeny","full_name":"Sweeny EA","initials":"EA"},{"last_name":"Mack","full_name":"Mack KL","initials":"KL"},{"last_name":"Chuang","full_name":"Chuang E","initials":"E"},{"last_name":"Torrente","full_name":"Torrente MP","initials":"MP"},{"last_name":"Su","full_name":"Su M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Shorter","full_name":"Shorter J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Southworth","full_name":"Southworth DR","initials":"DR"}],"title":"Ratchet-like polypeptide translocation mechanism of the AAA+ disaggregase Hsp104.","pubmed_id":"28619716","type":"J","associated_entries":"5vjh, 5vy8, 5vy9","doi":"10.1126/science.aan1052"}]}
