SecA is an essential protein component of this system, containing the molecular motor that facilitates translocation. Here we report the three-dimensional structure of the SecA protein of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Each subunit of the homodimer contains a \"motor\" domain and a translocation domain. The structure predicts that SecA can interact with the SecYEG pore and function as a molecular ratchet that uses ATP hydrolysis for physical movement of the preprotein. Knowledge of this structure provides a framework for further elucidation of the translocation process.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Sharma","full_name":"Sharma V","initials":"V"},{"last_name":"Arockiasamy","full_name":"Arockiasamy A","initials":"A"},{"last_name":"Ronning","full_name":"Ronning DR","initials":"DR"},{"last_name":"Savva","full_name":"Savva CG","initials":"CG"},{"last_name":"Holzenburg","full_name":"Holzenburg A","initials":"A"},{"last_name":"Braunstein","full_name":"Braunstein M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Jacobs","full_name":"Jacobs WR","initials":"WR"},{"last_name":"Sacchettini","full_name":"Sacchettini JC","initials":"JC"}],"title":"Crystal structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis SecA, a preprotein translocating ATPase.","pubmed_id":"12606717","type":"J","associated_entries":"1nkt","doi":"10.1073/pnas.0538077100"}]}
