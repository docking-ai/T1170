Here, we describe the structural and biochemical mechanisms of a bacteriophage immunity pathway found in a broad array of bacteria, including E.\u00a0coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This pathway uses eukaryotic-like HORMA domain proteins that recognize specific peptides, then bind and activate a cGAS/DncV-like nucleotidyltransferase (CD-NTase) to generate a cyclic triadenylate (cAAA) second messenger; cAAA in turn activates an endonuclease effector, NucC. Signaling is attenuated by a homolog of the AAA+ ATPase Pch2/TRIP13, which binds and disassembles the active HORMA-CD-NTase complex. When expressed in non-pathogenic E.\u00a0coli, this pathway confers immunity against bacteriophage \u03bb through an abortive infection mechanism. Our findings reveal the molecular mechanisms of a bacterial defense pathway integrating a cGAS-like nucleotidyltransferase with HORMA domain proteins for threat sensing through protein detection and negative regulation by a Trip13 ATPase.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Ye","full_name":"Ye Q","initials":"Q"},{"last_name":"Lau","full_name":"Lau RK","initials":"RK"},{"last_name":"Mathews","full_name":"Mathews IT","initials":"IT"},{"last_name":"Birkholz","full_name":"Birkholz EA","initials":"EA"},{"last_name":"Watrous","full_name":"Watrous JD","initials":"JD"},{"last_name":"Azimi","full_name":"Azimi CS","initials":"CS"},{"last_name":"Pogliano","full_name":"Pogliano J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Jain","full_name":"Jain M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Corbett","full_name":"Corbett KD","initials":"KD"}],"title":"HORMA Domain Proteins and a Trip13-like ATPase Regulate Bacterial cGAS-like Enzymes to Mediate Bacteriophage Immunity.","pubmed_id":"31932165","type":"J","associated_entries":"6p80, 6p82, 6p8j, 6p8o, 6p8p, 6p8r, 6p8s, 6p8u, 6pb3, 6u7b","doi":"10.1016/j.molcel.2019.12.009"}]}
