All the elements in the Tn7 family utilize an AAA+ adaptor (TnsC) to coordinate target-site selection with transpososome assembly and to prevent insertions at sites already containing a Tn7 element. Owing to its multiple functions, TnsC is considered the linchpin in the Tn7 element. Here we present the high-resolution cryo-EM structure of TnsC bound to DNA using a gain-of-function variant of the protein and a DNA substrate that together recapitulate the recruitment to a specific DNA target site. TnsC forms an asymmetric ring on target DNA that segregates target-site selection and interaction with the paired-end complex to opposite faces of the ring. Unlike most AAA+ ATPases, TnsC uses a DNA distortion to find the target site but does not remodel DNA to activate transposition. By recognizing pre-distorted substrates, TnsC creates a built-in regulatory mechanism where ATP hydrolysis abolishes ring formation proximal to an existing element. This work unveils how Tn7 and Tn7-like elements determine the strict spacing between the target and integration sites.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Shen","full_name":"Shen Y","initials":"Y"},{"last_name":"Gomez-Blanco","full_name":"Gomez-Blanco J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Petassi","full_name":"Petassi MT","initials":"MT"},{"last_name":"Peters","full_name":"Peters JE","initials":"JE"},{"last_name":"Ortega","full_name":"Ortega J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Guarn\u00e9","full_name":"Guarn\u00e9 A","initials":"A"}],"title":"Structural basis for DNA targeting by the Tn7 transposon.","pubmed_id":"35173349","type":"J","associated_entries":"7mcs","doi":"10.1038/s41594-022-00724-8"}]}
