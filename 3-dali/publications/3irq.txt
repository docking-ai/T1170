For reasons not entirely understood, such dinucleotide repeats in genomic sequences have been associated with genomic instability leading to cancer. Adoption of the left-handed conformation results in the formation of conformational junctions: A B-to-Z junction is formed at the boundaries of the helix, whereas a Z-to-Z junction is commonly formed in sequences where the dinucleotide repeat is interrupted by single base insertions or deletions that bring neighboring helices out of phase. B-Z junctions are shown to result in exposed nucleotides vulnerable to chemical or enzymatic modification. Here we describe the three-dimensional structure of a Z-Z junction stabilized by Zalpha, the Z-DNA binding domain of the RNA editing enzyme ADAR1. We show that the junction structure consists of a single base pair and leads to partial or full disruption of the helical stacking. The junction region allows intercalating agents to insert themselves into the left-handed helix, which is otherwise resistant to intercalation. However, unlike a B-Z junction, in this structure the bases are not fully extruded, and the stacking between the two left-handed helices is not continuous.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"de Rosa","full_name":"de Rosa M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"de Sanctis","full_name":"de Sanctis D","initials":"D"},{"last_name":"Rosario","full_name":"Rosario AL","initials":"AL"},{"last_name":"Archer","full_name":"Archer M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Rich","full_name":"Rich A","initials":"A"},{"last_name":"Athanasiadis","full_name":"Athanasiadis A","initials":"A"},{"last_name":"Carrondo","full_name":"Carrondo MA","initials":"MA"}],"title":"Crystal structure of a junction between two Z-DNA helices.","pubmed_id":"20439751","type":"J","associated_entries":"3irr","doi":"10.1073/pnas.1003182107"}]}
