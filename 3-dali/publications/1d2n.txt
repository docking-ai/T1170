NSF consists of an amino-terminal region that interacts with other components of the vesicle trafficking machinery, followed by two homologous ATP-binding cassettes, designated D1 and D2, that possess essential ATPase and hexamerization activities, respectively. The crystal structure of D2 bound to Mg2+-AMPPNP has been determined at 1.75 A resolution. The structure consists of a nucleotide-binding and a helical domain, and it is unexpectedly similar to the first two domains of the clamp-loading subunit delta' of E. coli DNA polymerase III. The structure suggests several regions responsible for coupling of ATP hydrolysis to structural changes in full-length NSF.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Lenzen","full_name":"Lenzen CU","initials":"CU"},{"last_name":"Steinmann","full_name":"Steinmann D","initials":"D"},{"last_name":"Whiteheart","full_name":"Whiteheart SW","initials":"SW"},{"last_name":"Weis","full_name":"Weis WI","initials":"WI"}],"title":"Crystal structure of the hexamerization domain of N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein.","pubmed_id":"9727495","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81593-7"}]}
