MukBEF activity within the replication terminus macrodomain is suppressed by the sequence-specific unloader MatP. Here, we present the complete atomic structure of MukBEF in complex with MatP and DNA as determined by electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM). The complex binds two distinct DNA double helices corresponding to the arms of a plectonemic loop. MatP-bound DNA threads through the MukBEF ring, while the second DNA is clamped by the kleisin MukF, MukE, and the MukB ATPase heads. Combinatorial cysteine cross-linking confirms this topology of DNA loop entrapment in\u00a0vivo. Our findings illuminate how a class of near-ubiquitous DNA organizers with important roles in genome maintenance interacts with the bacterial chromosome.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"B\u00fcrmann","full_name":"B\u00fcrmann F","initials":"F"},{"last_name":"Funke","full_name":"Funke LFH","initials":"LFH"},{"last_name":"Chin","full_name":"Chin JW","initials":"JW"},{"last_name":"L\u00f6we","full_name":"L\u00f6we J","initials":"J"}],"title":"Cryo-EM structure of MukBEF reveals DNA loop entrapment at chromosomal unloading sites.","pubmed_id":"34739874","type":"J","associated_entries":"7nyx, 7nyy, 7nyz, 7nz0, 7nz2, 7nz3, 7nz4","doi":"10.1016/j.molcel.2021.10.011"},{"journal_info":{"volume":null,"pdb_abbreviation":"Biorxiv","ISO_abbreviation":null,"year":2021,"issue":null,"pages":"-"},"abstract":{"methods":null,"conclusions":null,"results":null,"unassigned":null,"background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":null,"full_name":"Buermann, F.","initials":null},{"last_name":null,"full_name":"Funke, L.F.H.","initials":null},{"last_name":null,"full_name":"Chin, J.W.","initials":null},{"last_name":null,"full_name":"Lowe, J.","initials":null}],"title":"DNA entrapment revealed by the structure of bacterial condensin MukBEF","pubmed_id":null,"type":"Q","associated_entries":"7nyx, 7nyy, 7nyz, 7nz0, 7nz2, 7nz3, 7nz4","doi":"10.1101/2021.06.29.450292"}]}
