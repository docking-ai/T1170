The 2.0 A crystal structure of an archaeal Cdc6 ortholog, in conjunction with a mutational analysis of the homologous Cdc18 protein from Schizosaccharomyces pombe, reveals novel aspects of Cdc6/Cdc18 function. Two domains of Cdc6 form an AAA+-type nucleotide binding fold that is observed bound to Mg.ADP. A third domain adopts a winged-helix fold similar to known DNA binding modules. Sequence comparisons show that the winged-helix domain is conserved in Orc1, and mutagenesis data demonstrate that this region of Cdc6/Cdc18 is required for function in vivo. Additional mutational analyses suggest that nucleotide binding and/or hydrolysis by Cdc6/Cdc18 is required not only for progression through S phase, but also for maintenance of checkpoint control during S phase.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Liu","full_name":"Liu J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Smith","full_name":"Smith CL","initials":"CL"},{"last_name":"DeRyckere","full_name":"DeRyckere D","initials":"D"},{"last_name":"DeAngelis","full_name":"DeAngelis K","initials":"K"},{"last_name":"Martin","full_name":"Martin GS","initials":"GS"},{"last_name":"Berger","full_name":"Berger JM","initials":"JM"}],"title":"Structure and function of Cdc6/Cdc18: implications for origin recognition and checkpoint control.","pubmed_id":"11030343","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1016/S1097-2765(00)00062-9"}]}
