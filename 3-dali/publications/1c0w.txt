In Corynebacterium diphtheriae, DtxR regulates not only the expression of diphtheria toxin encoded by a corynebacteriophage, but also of components of the siderophore-mediated iron-transport system. Here we report the crystal structure of wild-type DtxR, a 226 residue three-domain dimeric protein, activated by cobalt and bound to a 21 bp DNA duplex based on the consensus operator sequence. Two DtxR dimers surround the DNA duplex which is distorted compared to canonical B -DNA. The SH3-like third domain interacts with the metal at site 1 via the side-chains of Glu170 and Gln173, revealing for the first time a metal-binding function for this class of domains. The SH3-like domain is also in contact with the DNA-binding first domain and with the second, or dimerization, domain. The DNA-binding helices in the first domain are shifted by 3 to 5 A when compared to the apo-repressor, and fit into the major groove of the duplex bound. These shifts are due to a hinge-binding motion of the DNA-binding domain with respect to the dimerization domains of DtxR. The third domain might play a role in regulating this hinge motion.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Pohl","full_name":"Pohl E","initials":"E"},{"last_name":"Holmes","full_name":"Holmes RK","initials":"RK"},{"last_name":"Hol","full_name":"Hol WG","initials":"WG"}],"title":"Crystal structure of a cobalt-activated diphtheria toxin repressor-DNA complex reveals a metal-binding SH3-like domain.","pubmed_id":"10497029","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1006/jmbi.1999.3073"}]}
