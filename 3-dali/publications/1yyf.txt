The observed structure in such cases is a weighted sum of two identical but translated structures, one from each lattice; the observed structure factors are a weighted vector sum of the structure factors with identical unit amplitudes but shifted phases. The correction of X-ray intensities from a single crystal containing these defects of the hybrid HslV-HslU complex, which consists of Escherichia coli HslU and Bacillus subtilis HslV (also known as CodW), is reported. When intensities are not corrected, a biologically irrelevant complex (with CodW from one lattice and HslU from another) is implied to exist. Only upon correction does a biologically functional CodW-HslU complex structure emerge.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Wang","full_name":"Wang J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Rho","full_name":"Rho SH","initials":"SH"},{"last_name":"Park","full_name":"Park HH","initials":"HH"},{"last_name":"Eom","full_name":"Eom SH","initials":"SH"}],"title":"Correction of X-ray intensities from an HslV-HslU co-crystal containing lattice-translocation defects.","pubmed_id":"15983416","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1107/S0907444905009546"},{"journal_info":{"volume":"61","pdb_abbreviation":"Acta Crystallogr.

Crystal structures show that HslU forms a hexamer with a pore at one end and HslV forms a dodecamer with translocation pores at both ends of two back-to-back stacked hexameric rings. Consistent with three electron microscopic studies and one small-angle X-ray scattering study, three crystal structures show that the nucleotide-binding domains of HslU bind to HslV and that the pores of the peptidase and ATPase are next to each other and aligned. A fourth crystal structure shows a radically different quaternary arrangement. Here I present a crystallographic analysis of the fourth structure to show that it contained a crystallographic origin shift and a mistake in space group assignment. Once these errors are corrected, a quaternary arrangement that is similar to those observed in the other structures emerges.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Wang","full_name":"Wang J","initials":"J"}],"title":"A corrected quaternary arrangement of the peptidase HslV and atpase HslU in a cocrystal structure.","pubmed_id":"11469873","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1006/jsbi.2001.4347"},{"journal_info":{"volume":"403","pdb_abbreviation":"Nature","ISO_abbreviation":null,"year":2000,"issue":null,"pages":"800-805"},"abstract":{"methods":null,"conclusions":null,"results":null,"unassigned":null,"background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":null,"full_name":"Bochtler, M.","initials":null},{"last_name":null,"full_name":"Hartmann, C.","initials":null},{"last_name":null,"full_name":"Song, H.K.","initials":null},{"last_name":null,"full_name":"Bourenkov, G.P.","initials":null},{"last_name":null,"full_name":"Bartunik, H.D.","initials":null},{"last_name":null,"full_name":"Huber, R.","initials":null}],"title":"The structures of HslU and the ATP-dependent protease HslU-HslV","pubmed_id":null,"type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":null}]}
