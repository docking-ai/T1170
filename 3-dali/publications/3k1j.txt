Lon is a tandem fusion of an AAA+ molecular chaperone and a protease with a serine-lysine catalytic dyad. We report the 2.0-\u00c5 resolution crystal structure of Thermococcus onnurineus NA1 Lon (TonLon). The structure is a three-tiered hexagonal cylinder with a large sequestered chamber accessible through an axial channel. Conserved loops extending from the AAA+ domain combine with an insertion domain containing the membrane anchor to form an apical domain that serves as a gate governing substrate access to an internal unfolding and degradation chamber. Alternating AAA+ domains are in tight- and weak-binding nucleotide states with different domain orientations and intersubunit contacts, reflecting intramolecular dynamics during ATP-driven protein unfolding and translocation. The bowl-shaped proteolytic chamber is contiguous with the chaperone chamber allowing internalized proteins direct access to the proteolytic sites without further gating restrictions.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Cha","full_name":"Cha SS","initials":"SS"},{"last_name":"An","full_name":"An YJ","initials":"YJ"},{"last_name":"Lee","full_name":"Lee CR","initials":"CR"},{"last_name":"Lee","full_name":"Lee HS","initials":"HS"},{"last_name":"Kim","full_name":"Kim YG","initials":"YG"},{"last_name":"Kim","full_name":"Kim SJ","initials":"SJ"},{"last_name":"Kwon","full_name":"Kwon KK","initials":"KK"},{"last_name":"De Donatis","full_name":"De Donatis GM","initials":"GM"},{"last_name":"Lee","full_name":"Lee JH","initials":"JH"},{"last_name":"Maurizi","full_name":"Maurizi MR","initials":"MR"},{"last_name":"Kang","full_name":"Kang SG","initials":"SG"}],"title":"Crystal structure of Lon protease: molecular architecture of gated entry to a sequestered degradation chamber.","pubmed_id":"20834233","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1038/emboj.2010.226"}]}
