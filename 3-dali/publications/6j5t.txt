Biochemical mechanisms underlying plant NLR activation have until now remained poorly understood. We reconstituted an active complex containing the <i>Arabidopsis</i> coiled-coil NLR ZAR1, the pseudokinase RKS1, uridylated protein kinase PBL2, and 2'-deoxyadenosine 5'-triphosphate (dATP), demonstrating the oligomerization of the complex during immune activation. The cryo-electron microscopy structure reveals a wheel-like pentameric ZAR1 resistosome. Besides the nucleotide-binding domain, the coiled-coil domain of ZAR1 also contributes to resistosome pentamerization by forming an \u03b1-helical barrel that interacts with the leucine-rich repeat and winged-helix domains. Structural remodeling and fold switching during activation release the very N-terminal amphipathic \u03b1 helix of ZAR1 to form a funnel-shaped structure that is required for the plasma membrane association, cell death triggering, and disease resistance, offering clues to the biochemical function of a plant resistosome.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Wang","full_name":"Wang J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Hu","full_name":"Hu M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Wang","full_name":"Wang J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Qi","full_name":"Qi J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Han","full_name":"Han Z","initials":"Z"},{"last_name":"Wang","full_name":"Wang G","initials":"G"},{"last_name":"Qi","full_name":"Qi Y","initials":"Y"},{"last_name":"Wang","full_name":"Wang HW","initials":"HW"},{"last_name":"Zhou","full_name":"Zhou JM","initials":"JM"},{"last_name":"Chai","full_name":"Chai J","initials":"J"}],"pubmed_id":"30948527","type":"J"}]}
