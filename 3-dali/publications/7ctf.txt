The detailed molecular mechanisms by which human ORC is reconfigured into a state competent for origin association remain largely unknown. Here, we present structural characterizations of human ORC1-5 and ORC2-5 assemblies. ORC2-5 exhibits a tightly autoinhibited conformation with the winged-helix domain of ORC2 completely blocking the central DNA-binding channel. The binding of ORC1 partially relieves the autoinhibitory effect of ORC2-5 through remodeling ORC2-WHD, which makes ORC2-WHD away from the central channel creating a still autoinhibited but more dynamic structure. In particular, the AAA+ domain of ORC1 is highly flexible to sample a variety of conformations from inactive to potentially active states. These results provide insights into the detailed mechanisms regulating the autoinhibition of human ORC and its subsequent activation for DNA binding.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Cheng","full_name":"Cheng J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Li","full_name":"Li N","initials":"N"},{"last_name":"Wang","full_name":"Wang X","initials":"X"},{"last_name":"Hu","full_name":"Hu J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Zhai","full_name":"Zhai Y","initials":"Y"},{"last_name":"Gao","full_name":"Gao N","initials":"N"}],"pubmed_id":"33298899","type":"J"}]}
