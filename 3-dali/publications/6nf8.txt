Here we present 3.3- to 3.5-\u00c5-resolution cryoelectron microscopic structures of the mammalian 28S mitoribosomal subunit in complex with human IF3<sub>mt</sub>. Unique contacts observed between the 28S subunit and N-terminal domain of IF3<sub>mt</sub> explain its unusually high affinity for the 28S subunit, whereas the position of the mito-specific NTE suggests NTE's role in binding of initiator tRNA to the 28S subunit. The location of the C-terminal domain (CTD) clarifies its anti-association activity, whereas the orientation of the mito-specific CTE provides a mechanistic explanation for its role in destabilizing initiator tRNA in the absence of mRNA. Furthermore, our structure hints at a possible role of the CTD in recruiting leaderless mRNAs for translation initiation. Our findings highlight unique features of IF3<sub>mt</sub> in mitochondrial translation initiation.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Koripella","full_name":"Koripella RK","initials":"RK"},{"last_name":"Sharma","full_name":"Sharma MR","initials":"MR"},{"last_name":"Haque","full_name":"Haque ME","initials":"ME"},{"last_name":"Risteff","full_name":"Risteff P","initials":"P"},{"last_name":"Spremulli","full_name":"Spremulli LL","initials":"LL"},{"last_name":"Agrawal","full_name":"Agrawal RK","initials":"RK"}],"title":"Structure of Human Mitochondrial Translation Initiation Factor 3 Bound to the Small Ribosomal Subunit.","pubmed_id":"30677741","type":"J","associated_entries":"6neq","doi":"10.1016/j.isci.2018.12.030"}]}
