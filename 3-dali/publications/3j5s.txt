Here, we elucidate the mechanism of a newly characterized regulatory translation factor, energy-dependent translational throttle A (EttA), which is an Escherichia coli representative of the ATP-binding cassette F (ABC-F) protein family. Using cryo-EM, we demonstrate that the ATP-bound form of EttA binds to the ribosomal tRNA-exit site, where it forms bridging interactions between the ribosomal L1 stalk and the tRNA bound in the peptidyl-tRNA-binding site. Using single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer, we show that the ATP-bound form of EttA restricts ribosome and tRNA dynamics required for protein synthesis. This work represents the first example, to our knowledge, in which the detailed molecular mechanism of any ABC-F family protein has been determined and establishes a framework for elucidating the mechanisms of other regulatory translation factors.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Chen","full_name":"Chen B","initials":"B"},{"last_name":"Bo\u00ebl","full_name":"Bo\u00ebl G","initials":"G"},{"last_name":"Hashem","full_name":"Hashem Y","initials":"Y"},{"last_name":"Ning","full_name":"Ning W","initials":"W"},{"last_name":"Fei","full_name":"Fei J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Wang","full_name":"Wang C","initials":"C"},{"last_name":"Gonzalez","full_name":"Gonzalez RL","initials":"RL"},{"last_name":"Hunt","full_name":"Hunt JF","initials":"JF"},{"last_name":"Frank","full_name":"Frank J","initials":"J"}],"pubmed_id":"24389465","type":"J"},{"journal_info":{"volume":null,"pdb_abbreviation":"Nat Struct Mol Biol","ISO_abbreviation":"Nat.

Herein, we demonstrate that YjjK, the most prevalent eubacterial ABC-F protein, gates ribosome entry into the translation elongation cycle through a nucleotide-dependent interaction sensitive to ATP/ADP ratio. Accordingly, we rename this protein energy-dependent translational throttle A (EttA). We determined the crystal structure of Escherichia coli EttA and used it to design mutants for biochemical studies including enzymological assays of the initial steps of protein synthesis. These studies suggest that EttA may regulate protein synthesis in energy-depleted cells, which have a low ATP/ADP ratio. Consistently with this inference, EttA-deleted cells exhibit a severe fitness defect in long-term stationary phase. These studies demonstrate that an ABC-F protein regulates protein synthesis via a new mechanism sensitive to cellular energy status.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Bo\u00ebl","full_name":"Bo\u00ebl G","initials":"G"},{"last_name":"Smith","full_name":"Smith PC","initials":"PC"},{"last_name":"Ning","full_name":"Ning W","initials":"W"},{"last_name":"Englander","full_name":"Englander MT","initials":"MT"},{"last_name":"Chen","full_name":"Chen B","initials":"B"},{"last_name":"Hashem","full_name":"Hashem Y","initials":"Y"},{"last_name":"Testa","full_name":"Testa AJ","initials":"AJ"},{"last_name":"Fischer","full_name":"Fischer JJ","initials":"JJ"},{"last_name":"Wieden","full_name":"Wieden HJ","initials":"HJ"},{"last_name":"Frank","full_name":"Frank J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Gonzalez","full_name":"Gonzalez RL","initials":"RL"},{"last_name":"Hunt","full_name":"Hunt JF","initials":"JF"}],"pubmed_id":"24389466","type":"B"}]}
