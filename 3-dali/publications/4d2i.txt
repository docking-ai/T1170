Here we extend our structural knowledge of this minimal end-resection apparatus by presenting the first crystal structure of hexameric HerA. The full-length structure visualizes at atomic resolution the N-terminal HerA-ATP synthase domain and a conserved C-terminal extension, which acts as a physical brace between adjacent protomers. The brace also interacts in trans with nucleotide-binding residues of the neighbouring subunit. Our observations support a model in which the coaxial interaction of the HerA ring with the toroidal NurA dimer generates a continuous channel traversing the complex. HerA-driven translocation would propel the DNA towards the narrow annulus of NurA, leading to duplex melting and nucleolytic digestion. This system differs substantially from the bacterial end-resection paradigms. Our findings suggest a novel mode of DNA-end processing by this integrated archaeal helicase-nuclease machine.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Rzechorzek","full_name":"Rzechorzek NJ","initials":"NJ"},{"last_name":"Blackwood","full_name":"Blackwood JK","initials":"JK"},{"last_name":"Bray","full_name":"Bray SM","initials":"SM"},{"last_name":"Maman","full_name":"Maman JD","initials":"JD"},{"last_name":"Pellegrini","full_name":"Pellegrini L","initials":"L"},{"last_name":"Robinson","full_name":"Robinson NP","initials":"NP"}],"pubmed_id":"25420454","type":"J"}]}
