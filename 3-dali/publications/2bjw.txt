We have determined by cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) a 20 angstrom resolution structure of an activator, phage shock protein F [PspF(1-275)], which is bound to an ATP transition state analog in complex with its basal factor, sigma54. By fitting the crystal structure of PspF(1-275) at 1.75 angstroms into the EM map, we identified two loops involved in binding sigma54. Comparing enhancer-binding structures in different nucleotide states and mutational analysis led us to propose nucleotide-dependent conformational changes that free the loops for association with sigma54.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Rappas","full_name":"Rappas M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Schumacher","full_name":"Schumacher J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Beuron","full_name":"Beuron F","initials":"F"},{"last_name":"Niwa","full_name":"Niwa H","initials":"H"},{"last_name":"Bordes","full_name":"Bordes P","initials":"P"},{"last_name":"Wigneshweraraj","full_name":"Wigneshweraraj S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Keetch","full_name":"Keetch CA","initials":"CA"},{"last_name":"Robinson","full_name":"Robinson CV","initials":"CV"},{"last_name":"Buck","full_name":"Buck M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Zhang","full_name":"Zhang X","initials":"X"}],"title":"Structural insights into the activity of enhancer-binding proteins.","pubmed_id":"15790859","type":"J","associated_entries":"2bjv","doi":"10.1126/science.1105932"}]}
