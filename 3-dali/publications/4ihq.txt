Here, we structurally and functionally characterize prototypical superfamily ATPase FlaI in Sulfolobus acidocaldarius, showing FlaI activities in archaeal swimming-organelle assembly and movement. X-ray scattering data of FlaI in solution and crystal structures with and without nucleotide reveal\u00a0a hexameric crown assembly with key cross-subunit interactions. Rigid building blocks form between N-terminal domains (points) and neighboring subunit C-terminal domains (crown ring). Upon nucleotide binding, these six cross-subunit blocks move with respect to each other and distinctly from secretion and pilus ATPases. Crown interactions and conformations regulate assembly, motility, and force direction via a basic-clamp switching mechanism driving conformational changes between stable, backbone-interconnected moving blocks. Collective structural and mutational results identify in\u00a0vivo functional components for assembly and motility, phosphate-triggered rearrangements by ATP hydrolysis, and molecular predictors for distinct ATPase superfamily functions.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Reindl","full_name":"Reindl S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Ghosh","full_name":"Ghosh A","initials":"A"},{"last_name":"Williams","full_name":"Williams GJ","initials":"GJ"},{"last_name":"Lassak","full_name":"Lassak K","initials":"K"},{"last_name":"Neiner","full_name":"Neiner T","initials":"T"},{"last_name":"Henche","full_name":"Henche AL","initials":"AL"},{"last_name":"Albers","full_name":"Albers SV","initials":"SV"},{"last_name":"Tainer","full_name":"Tainer JA","initials":"JA"}],"title":"Insights into FlaI Functions in Archaeal Motor Assembly and Motility from Structures, Conformations, and Genetics.","pubmed_id":"23416110","type":"J","associated_entries":"4ii7","doi":"10.1016/j.molcel.2013.01.014"}]}
