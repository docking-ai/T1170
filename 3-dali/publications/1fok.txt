Because of its unusual bipartite nature, FokI has been used to create artificial enzymes with new specificities. We have determined the crystal structure at 2.8A resolution of the complete FokI enzyme bound to DNA. As anticipated, the enzyme contains amino- and carboxy-terminal domains corresponding to the DNA-recognition and cleavage functions, respectively. The recognition domain is made of three smaller subdomains (D1, D2 and D3) which are evolutionarily related to the helix-turn-helix-containing DNA-binding domain of the catabolite gene activator protein CAP. The CAP core has been extensively embellished in the first two subdomains, whereas in the third subdomain it has been co-opted for protein-protein interactions. Surprisingly, the cleavage domain contains only a single catalytic centre, raising the question of how monomeric FokI manages to cleave both DNA strands. Unexpectedly, the cleavage domain is sequestered in a 'piggyback' fashion by the recognition domain. The structure suggests a new mechanism for nuclease activation and provides a framework for the design of chimaeric enzymes with altered specificities.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Wah","full_name":"Wah DA","initials":"DA"},{"last_name":"Hirsch","full_name":"Hirsch JA","initials":"JA"},{"last_name":"Dorner","full_name":"Dorner LF","initials":"LF"},{"last_name":"Schildkraut","full_name":"Schildkraut I","initials":"I"},{"last_name":"Aggarwal","full_name":"Aggarwal AK","initials":"AK"}],"pubmed_id":"9214510","type":"J"},{"journal_info":{"volume":"403","pdb_abbreviation":"FEBS Lett","ISO_abbreviation":"FEBS Lett","year":1997,"issue":"2","pages":"136-8"},"doi":"10.1016/s0014-5793(97)00039-2","associated_entries":null,"title":"Crystallization and preliminary X-ray analysis of restriction endonuclease FokI bound to DNA.","abstract":{"methods":null,"conclusions":null,"results":null,"unassigned":"FokI is a type IIs restriction endonuclease which recognizes an asymmetric DNA sequence and cleaves DNA a short distance away from the sequence.

We report here cocrystals of the complete FokI enzyme (579 amino acids) bound to a 20-bp DNA fragment containing its recognition sequence. The complex is amongst the largest protein-DNA complexes to be crystallized, and required macroseeding techniques for optimal crystal growth. The cocrystals diffract to at least 2.8 A in resolution and belong to space group P2(1) with unit cell dimensions of a=67.9 A, b=119.8 A, c=69.1 A, beta = 96.6 degrees. Using specific amino acid analysis we show that asymmetric unit contains a single FokI molecule bound to the 20-bp DNA fragment.
