Here we present the crystal structure of the sulfur-binding domain (SBD) from the DNA phosphorothioation (PT)-dependent restriction endonuclease ScoMcrA. SBD contains a hydrophobic surface cavity that is formed by the aromatic ring of Y164, the pyrolidine ring of P165, and the non-polar side chains of four other residues that serve as lid, base, and wall of the cavity. The SBD and PT-DNA undergo conformational changes upon binding. The S<sub>187</sub>RGRR<sub>191</sub> loop inserts into the DNA major groove to make contacts with the bases of the G<sub>PS</sub>GCC core sequence. Mutating key residues of SBD impairs PT-DNA association. More than 1000 sequenced microbial species from fourteen phyla contain SBD homologs. We show that three of these homologs bind PT-DNA in vitro and restrict PT-DNA gene transfer in vivo. These results show that SBD-like PT-DNA readers exist widely in prokaryotes.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Liu","full_name":"Liu G","initials":"G"},{"last_name":"Fu","full_name":"Fu W","initials":"W"},{"last_name":"Zhang","full_name":"Zhang Z","initials":"Z"},{"last_name":"He","full_name":"He Y","initials":"Y"},{"last_name":"Yu","full_name":"Yu H","initials":"H"},{"last_name":"Wang","full_name":"Wang Y","initials":"Y"},{"last_name":"Wang","full_name":"Wang X","initials":"X"},{"last_name":"Zhao","full_name":"Zhao YL","initials":"YL"},{"last_name":"Deng","full_name":"Deng Z","initials":"Z"},{"last_name":"Wu","full_name":"Wu G","initials":"G"},{"last_name":"He","full_name":"He X","initials":"X"}],"title":"Structural basis for the recognition of sulfur in phosphorothioated DNA.","pubmed_id":"30409991","type":"J","associated_entries":"5zmn, 5zmo","doi":"10.1038/s41467-018-07093-1"}]}
