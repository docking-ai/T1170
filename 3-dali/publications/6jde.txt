The radD (yejH) gene, which belongs to SF2, plays an important role in DNA repair. The RadD protein includes all seven conserved SF2 motifs and has shown ATPase activity. Here, we first reported the structure of RadD from Escherichia coli containing two RecA-like domains, a zinc finger motif, and a C-terminal domain. Based on the structure of RadD and other SF2 proteins, we then built a model of the RedD-ATP complex.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Kuang","full_name":"Kuang X","initials":"X"},{"last_name":"Tang","full_name":"Tang Q","initials":"Q"},{"last_name":"Liu","full_name":"Liu YP","initials":"YP"},{"last_name":"Yan","full_name":"Yan XX","initials":"XX"},{"last_name":"Xu","full_name":"Xu W","initials":"W"}],"title":"Crystal structure of a novel ATPase RadD from Escherichia coli.","pubmed_id":"31035307","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1002/prot.25704"}]}
