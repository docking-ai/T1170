The nucleotide binds at a cleft formed by an alpha/beta domain and an alpha-helical domain in HslU. The four HslU states differ by a rotation of the alpha-helical domain. This classification leads to a correction of nucleotide identity in one structure and reveals the ATP hydrolysis-dependent structural changes in the HslVU complex, including a ring rotation and a conformational change of the HslU C terminus. This leads to an amended protein unfolding-coupled translocation mechanism.","unassigned":null,"background":"The bacterial heat shock locus ATPase HslU is an AAA(+) protein that has structures known in many nucleotide-free and -bound states. Nucleotide is required for the formation of the biologically active HslU hexameric assembly. The hexameric HslU ATPase binds the dodecameric HslV peptidase and forms an ATP-dependent HslVU protease.","objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Wang","full_name":"Wang J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Song","full_name":"Song JJ","initials":"JJ"},{"last_name":"Seong","full_name":"Seong IS","initials":"IS"},{"last_name":"Franklin","full_name":"Franklin MC","initials":"MC"},{"last_name":"Kamtekar","full_name":"Kamtekar S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Eom","full_name":"Eom SH","initials":"SH"},{"last_name":"Chung","full_name":"Chung CH","initials":"CH"}],"title":"Nucleotide-dependent conformational changes in a protease-associated ATPase HsIU.","pubmed_id":"11709174","type":"J","associated_entries":"1hqy, 1ht1","doi":"10.1016/S0969-2126(01)00670-0"},{"journal_info":{"volume":"97","pdb_abbreviation":"Proc.
