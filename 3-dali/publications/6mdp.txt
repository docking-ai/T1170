A highly conserved AAA+ protein, NSF (<i>N</i>-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor) and an adaptor protein, SNAP (soluble NSF attachment protein), disassembles the SNARE complex. We report electron-cryomicroscopy structures of the complex of NSF, \u03b1SNAP, and the full-length soluble neuronal SNARE complex (composed of syntaxin-1A, synaptobrevin-2, SNAP-25A) in the presence of ATP under non-hydrolyzing conditions at ~3.9 \u00c5 resolution. These structures reveal electrostatic interactions by which two \u03b1SNAP molecules interface with a specific surface of the SNARE complex. This interaction positions the SNAREs such that the 15 N-terminal residues of SNAP-25A are loaded into the D1 ring pore of NSF via a spiral pattern of interactions between a conserved tyrosine NSF residue and SNAP-25A backbone atoms. This loading process likely precedes ATP hydrolysis. Subsequent ATP hydrolysis then drives complete disassembly.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"White","full_name":"White KI","initials":"KI"},{"last_name":"Zhao","full_name":"Zhao M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Choi","full_name":"Choi UB","initials":"UB"},{"last_name":"Pfuetzner","full_name":"Pfuetzner RA","initials":"RA"},{"last_name":"Brunger","full_name":"Brunger AT","initials":"AT"}],"title":"Structural principles of SNARE complex recognition by the AAA+ protein NSF.","pubmed_id":"30198481","type":"J","associated_entries":"6mdm, 6mdn, 6mdo","doi":"10.7554/eLife.38888"}]}
