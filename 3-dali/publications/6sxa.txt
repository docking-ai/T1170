How XPF-ERCC1 is catalytically activated by DNA junction substrates is not currently understood. Here we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of both DNA-free and DNA-bound human XPF-ERCC1. DNA-free XPF-ERCC1 adopts an auto-inhibited conformation in which the XPF helical domain masks the ERCC1 (HhH)<sub>2</sub> domain and restricts access to the XPF catalytic site. DNA junction engagement releases the ERCC1 (HhH)<sub>2</sub> domain to couple with the XPF-ERCC1 nuclease/nuclease-like domains. Structure-function data indicate xeroderma pigmentosum patient mutations frequently compromise the structural integrity of XPF-ERCC1. Fanconi anaemia patient mutations in XPF\u00a0often display substantial in-vitro activity but are resistant to activation by ICLR recruitment factor SLX4. Our data provide insights into XPF-ERCC1 architecture and catalytic activation.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Jones","full_name":"Jones M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Beuron","full_name":"Beuron F","initials":"F"},{"last_name":"Borg","full_name":"Borg A","initials":"A"},{"last_name":"Nans","full_name":"Nans A","initials":"A"},{"last_name":"Earl","full_name":"Earl CP","initials":"CP"},{"last_name":"Briggs","full_name":"Briggs DC","initials":"DC"},{"last_name":"Snijders","full_name":"Snijders AP","initials":"AP"},{"last_name":"Bowles","full_name":"Bowles M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Morris","full_name":"Morris EP","initials":"EP"},{"last_name":"Linch","full_name":"Linch M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"McDonald","full_name":"McDonald NQ","initials":"NQ"}],"title":"Cryo-EM structures of the XPF-ERCC1 endonuclease reveal how DNA-junction engagement disrupts an auto-inhibited conformation.","pubmed_id":"32111838","type":"J","associated_entries":"6sxb","doi":"10.1038/s41467-020-14856-2"}]}
