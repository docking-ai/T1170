The recruitment of Pol III to tRNA-encoding genes requires the transcription factors (TF) IIIB and IIIC. TFIIIC has been described as a conserved, multi-subunit protein complex composed of two subcomplexes, called \u03c4A and \u03c4B. How these two subcomplexes are linked and how their interaction affects the formation of the Pol III pre-initiation complex (PIC) is poorly understood. Here we use chemical crosslinking mass spectrometry and determine the molecular architecture of TFIIIC. We further report the crystal structure of the essential TPR array from \u03c4A subunit \u03c4131 and characterize its interaction with a central region of \u03c4B subunit \u03c4138. The identified \u03c4131-\u03c4138 interacting region is essential in vivo and overlaps with TFIIIB-binding sites, revealing a crucial interaction platform for the regulation of tRNA transcription initiation.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Male","full_name":"Male G","initials":"G"},{"last_name":"von Appen","full_name":"von Appen A","initials":"A"},{"last_name":"Glatt","full_name":"Glatt S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Taylor","full_name":"Taylor NM","initials":"NM"},{"last_name":"Cristovao","full_name":"Cristovao M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Groetsch","full_name":"Groetsch H","initials":"H"},{"last_name":"Beck","full_name":"Beck M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"M\u00fcller","full_name":"M\u00fcller CW","initials":"CW"}],"title":"Architecture of TFIIIC and its role in RNA polymerase III pre-initiation complex assembly.","pubmed_id":"26060179","type":"J","associated_entries":"5aem, 5aio","doi":"10.1038/ncomms8387"}]}
