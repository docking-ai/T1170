In many pathogens, the transition from a planktonic lifestyle to collaborative, sessile biofilms represents a regulated process orchestrated by the intracellular second-messenger c-di-GMP. A main effector for c-di-GMP signaling in the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the transcription regulator FleQ. FleQ is a bacterial enhancer-binding protein (bEBP) with a central AAA+ ATPase \u03c3(54)-interaction domain, flanked by a C-terminal helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif and a divergent N-terminal receiver domain. Together with a second ATPase, FleN, FleQ regulates the expression of flagellar and exopolysaccharide biosynthesis genes in response to cellular c-di-GMP. Here we report structural and functional data that reveal an unexpected mode of c-di-GMP recognition that is associated with major conformational rearrangements in FleQ. Crystal structures of FleQ's AAA+ ATPase domain in its apo-state or bound to ADP or ATP-\u03b3-S show conformations reminiscent of the activated ring-shaped assemblies of other bEBPs. As revealed by the structure of c-di-GMP-complexed FleQ, the second messenger interacts with the AAA+ ATPase domain at a site distinct from the ATP binding pocket. c-di-GMP interaction leads to active site obstruction, hexameric ring destabilization, and discrete quaternary structure transitions. Solution and cell-based studies confirm coupling of the ATPase active site and c-di-GMP binding, as well as the functional significance of crystallographic interprotomer interfaces. Taken together, our data offer unprecedented insight into conserved regulatory mechanisms of gene expression under direct c-di-GMP control via FleQ and FleQ-like bEBPs.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Matsuyama","full_name":"Matsuyama BY","initials":"BY"},{"last_name":"Krasteva","full_name":"Krasteva PV","initials":"PV"},{"last_name":"Baraquet","full_name":"Baraquet C","initials":"C"},{"last_name":"Harwood","full_name":"Harwood CS","initials":"CS"},{"last_name":"Sondermann","full_name":"Sondermann H","initials":"H"},{"last_name":"Navarro","full_name":"Navarro MV","initials":"MV"}],"title":"Mechanistic insights into c-di-GMP-dependent control of the biofilm regulator FleQ from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.","pubmed_id":"26712005","type":"J","associated_entries":"5exp, 5ext, 5exx","doi":"10.1073/pnas.1523148113"}]}
