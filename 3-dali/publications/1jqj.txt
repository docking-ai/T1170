The delta subunit of the gamma complex binds to the beta ring and opens it. The crystal structure of a beta:delta complex shows that delta, which is structurally related to the delta' and gamma subunits of the gamma complex, is a molecular wrench that induces or traps a conformational change in beta such that one of its dimer interfaces is destabilized. Structural comparisons and molecular dynamics simulations suggest a spring-loaded mechanism in which the beta ring opens spontaneously once a dimer interface is perturbed by the delta wrench.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Jeruzalmi","full_name":"Jeruzalmi D","initials":"D"},{"last_name":"Yurieva","full_name":"Yurieva O","initials":"O"},{"last_name":"Zhao","full_name":"Zhao Y","initials":"Y"},{"last_name":"Young","full_name":"Young M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Stewart","full_name":"Stewart J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Hingorani","full_name":"Hingorani M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"O'Donnell","full_name":"O'Donnell M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Kuriyan","full_name":"Kuriyan J","initials":"J"}],"pubmed_id":"11525728","type":"J"}]}
