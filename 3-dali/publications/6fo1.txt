However, the mechanism by which this occurs is poorly understood. Here we use cryo-EM and biochemical studies on the human R2TP core (RUVBL1-RUVBL2-RPAP3-PIH1D1) which reveal the distinctive role of RPAP3, distinguishing metazoan R2TP from the smaller yeast equivalent. RPAP3 spans both faces of a single RUVBL ring, providing an extended scaffold that recruits clients and provides a flexible tether for HSP90. A 3.6\u2009\u00c5 cryo-EM structure reveals direct interaction of a C-terminal domain of RPAP3 and the ATPase domain of RUVBL2, necessary for human R2TP assembly but absent from yeast. The mobile TPR domains of RPAP3 map to the opposite face of the ring, associating with PIH1D1, which mediates client protein recruitment. Thus, RPAP3 provides a flexible platform for bringing HSP90 into proximity with diverse client proteins.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Martino","full_name":"Martino F","initials":"F"},{"last_name":"Pal","full_name":"Pal M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Mu\u00f1oz-Hern\u00e1ndez","full_name":"Mu\u00f1oz-Hern\u00e1ndez H","initials":"H"},{"last_name":"Rodr\u00edguez","full_name":"Rodr\u00edguez CF","initials":"CF"},{"last_name":"N\u00fa\u00f1ez-Ram\u00edrez","full_name":"N\u00fa\u00f1ez-Ram\u00edrez R","initials":"R"},{"last_name":"Gil-Carton","full_name":"Gil-Carton D","initials":"D"},{"last_name":"Degliesposti","full_name":"Degliesposti G","initials":"G"},{"last_name":"Skehel","full_name":"Skehel JM","initials":"JM"},{"last_name":"Roe","full_name":"Roe SM","initials":"SM"},{"last_name":"Prodromou","full_name":"Prodromou C","initials":"C"},{"last_name":"Pearl","full_name":"Pearl LH","initials":"LH"},{"last_name":"Llorca","full_name":"Llorca O","initials":"O"}],"pubmed_id":"29662061","type":"J"}]}
