First, we resolved not only the three main states in the catalytic cycle described before but also eight substates that portray structural and mechanistic changes occurring during a 360\u00b0 catalytic cycle. Second, a mechanism of auto-inhibition of ATP hydrolysis involves not only the engagement of the C-terminal region of an \u03b1-subunit in a loop in the \u03b3-subunit, as proposed before, but also a \"fail-safe\" mechanism involving the b'-subunit in the peripheral stalk that enhances engagement. A third unreported characteristic is that the fused b\u03b4-subunit contains a duplicated domain in its N-terminal region where the two copies of the domain participate in similar modes of attachment of the two of three N-terminal regions of the \u03b1-subunits. The auto-inhibitory plus the associated \"fail-safe\" mechanisms and the modes of attachment of the \u03b1-subunits provide targets for development of innovative antitubercular drugs. The structure also provides support for an observation made in the bovine ATP synthase that the transmembrane proton-motive force that provides the energy to drive the rotary mechanism is delivered directly and tangentially to the rotor via a Grotthuss water chain in a polar L-shaped tunnel.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Montgomery","full_name":"Montgomery MG","initials":"MG"},{"last_name":"Petri","full_name":"Petri J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Spikes","full_name":"Spikes TE","initials":"TE"},{"last_name":"Walker","full_name":"Walker JE","initials":"JE"}],"title":"Structure of the ATP synthase from <i>Mycobacterium smegmatis</i> provides targets for treating tuberculosis.","pubmed_id":"34782468","type":"J","associated_entries":"7njk, 7njl, 7njm, 7njo, 7njp, 7njq, 7njr, 7njs, 7njt, 7nju, 7njv, 7njw, 7njx, 7njy, 7nk7, 7nk9, 7nkb, 7nkd, 7nkh, 7nkj, 7nkk, 7nkl, 7nkn, 7nkp, 7nkq, 7nl9","doi":"10.1073/pnas.2111899118"}]}
