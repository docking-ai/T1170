The crystal structures of hexameric DnaB and its complex with the helicase binding domain (HBD) of DnaG reveal that within the hexamer the two domains of DnaB pack with strikingly different symmetries to form a distinct two-layered ring structure. Each of three bound HBDs stabilizes the DnaB hexamer in a conformation that may increase its processivity. Three positive, conserved electrostatic patches on the N-terminal domain of DnaB may also serve as a binding site for DNA and thereby guide the DNA to a DnaG active site.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Bailey","full_name":"Bailey S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Eliason","full_name":"Eliason WK","initials":"WK"},{"last_name":"Steitz","full_name":"Steitz TA","initials":"TA"}],"pubmed_id":"17947583","type":"J"}]}
