The mammalian 55S mitoribosome contains significantly smaller rRNAs and a large mass of mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (MRPs), including large mito-specific amino acid extensions and insertions in MRPs that are homologous to bacterial ribosomal proteins and an additional 35 mito-specific MRPs. Here we present the cryo-EM structure analysis of the small (28S) subunit (SSU) of the 55S mitoribosome. We find that the mito-specific extensions in homologous MRPs generally are involved in inter-MRP contacts and in contacts with mito-specific MRPs, suggesting a stepwise evolution of the current architecture of the mitoribosome. Although most of the mito-specific MRPs and extensions of homologous MRPs are situated on the peripheral regions, they also contribute significantly to the formation of linings of the mRNA and tRNA paths, suggesting a tailor-made structural organization of the mito-SSU for the recruitment of mito-specific mRNAs, most of which do not possess a 5' leader sequence. In addition, docking of previously published coordinates of the large (39S) subunit (LSU) into the cryo-EM map of the 55S mitoribosome reveals that mito-specific MRPs of both the SSU and LSU are involved directly in the formation of six of the 15 intersubunit bridges.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Kaushal","full_name":"Kaushal PS","initials":"PS"},{"last_name":"Sharma","full_name":"Sharma MR","initials":"MR"},{"last_name":"Booth","full_name":"Booth TM","initials":"TM"},{"last_name":"Haque","full_name":"Haque EM","initials":"EM"},{"last_name":"Tung","full_name":"Tung CS","initials":"CS"},{"last_name":"Sanbonmatsu","full_name":"Sanbonmatsu KY","initials":"KY"},{"last_name":"Spremulli","full_name":"Spremulli LL","initials":"LL"},{"last_name":"Agrawal","full_name":"Agrawal RK","initials":"RK"}],"title":"Cryo-EM structure of the small subunit of the mammalian mitochondrial ribosome.","pubmed_id":"24799711","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1073/pnas.1401657111"}]}
