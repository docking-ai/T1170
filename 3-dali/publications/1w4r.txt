This structure is the first representative of the type II thymidine kinases found in several pathogens. The structure deviates strongly from the known structures of type I thymidine kinases such as the Herpes simplex enzyme. It contains a zinc-binding domain with four cysteines complexing a structural zinc ion. Interestingly, the backbone atoms of the type II enzyme bind thymine via hydrogen-bonds, in contrast to type I, where side chains are involved. This results in a specificity difference exploited for antiviral therapy. The presented structure will foster the development of new drugs and prodrugs for numerous therapeutic applications.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Birringer","full_name":"Birringer MS","initials":"MS"},{"last_name":"Claus","full_name":"Claus MT","initials":"MT"},{"last_name":"Folkers","full_name":"Folkers G","initials":"G"},{"last_name":"Kloer","full_name":"Kloer DP","initials":"DP"},{"last_name":"Schulz","full_name":"Schulz GE","initials":"GE"},{"last_name":"Scapozza","full_name":"Scapozza L","initials":"L"}],"pubmed_id":"15733844","type":"J"}]}
