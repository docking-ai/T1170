Not all six ATPase sites are required for unwinding; however, the helicase mechanism is unknown. We imaged ATP-hydrolysis-driven translocation of the CMG using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and found that the six MCM subunits engage DNA using four neighboring protomers at a time, with ATP binding promoting DNA engagement. Morphing between different helicase states leads us to suggest a non-symmetric hand-over-hand rotary mechanism, explaining the asymmetric requirements of ATPase function around the MCM ring of the CMG. By imaging of a higher-order replisome assembly, we find that the Mrc1-Csm3-Tof1 fork-stabilization complex strengthens the interaction between parental duplex DNA and the CMG at the fork, which might support the coupling between DNA translocation and fork unwinding.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Eickhoff","full_name":"Eickhoff P","initials":"P"},{"last_name":"Kose","full_name":"Kose HB","initials":"HB"},{"last_name":"Martino","full_name":"Martino F","initials":"F"},{"last_name":"Petojevic","full_name":"Petojevic T","initials":"T"},{"last_name":"Abid Ali","full_name":"Abid Ali F","initials":"F"},{"last_name":"Locke","full_name":"Locke J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Tamberg","full_name":"Tamberg N","initials":"N"},{"last_name":"Nans","full_name":"Nans A","initials":"A"},{"last_name":"Berger","full_name":"Berger JM","initials":"JM"},{"last_name":"Botchan","full_name":"Botchan MR","initials":"MR"},{"last_name":"Yardimci","full_name":"Yardimci H","initials":"H"},{"last_name":"Costa","full_name":"Costa A","initials":"A"}],"title":"Molecular Basis for ATP-Hydrolysis-Driven DNA Translocation by the CMG Helicase of the Eukaryotic Replisome.","pubmed_id":"31484077","type":"J","associated_entries":"6rax, 6ray, 6raz","doi":"10.1016/j.celrep.2019.07.104"}]}
