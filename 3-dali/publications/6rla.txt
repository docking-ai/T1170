Here we recombinantly expressed the ~1.4-MDa human dynein-2 complex and solved its cryo-EM structure to near-atomic resolution. The two identical copies of the dynein-2 heavy chain are contorted into different conformations by a WDR60-WDR34 heterodimer and a block of two RB and six LC8 light chains. One heavy chain is steered into a zig-zag conformation, which matches the periodicity of the anterograde IFT-B train. Contacts between adjacent dyneins along the train indicate a cooperative mode of assembly. Removal of the WDR60-WDR34-light chain subcomplex renders dynein-2 monomeric and relieves autoinhibition of its motility. Our results converge on a model in which an unusual stoichiometry of non-motor subunits controls dynein-2 assembly, asymmetry, and activity, giving mechanistic insight into the interaction of dynein-2 with IFT trains and the origin of diverse functions in the dynein family.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Toropova","full_name":"Toropova K","initials":"K"},{"last_name":"Zalyte","full_name":"Zalyte R","initials":"R"},{"last_name":"Mukhopadhyay","full_name":"Mukhopadhyay AG","initials":"AG"},{"last_name":"Mladenov","full_name":"Mladenov M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Carter","full_name":"Carter AP","initials":"AP"},{"last_name":"Roberts","full_name":"Roberts AJ","initials":"AJ"}],"title":"Structure of the dynein-2 complex and its assembly with intraflagellar transport trains.","pubmed_id":"31451806","type":"J","associated_entries":"6rlb, 6sc2","doi":"10.1038/s41594-019-0286-y"}]}
