EV71 nonstructural protein 2C participates in many critical events throughout the virus life cycle; however, its precise role is not fully understood. Lack of a high-resolution structure made it difficult to elucidate 2C activity and prevented inhibitor development. We report the 2.5 \u00c5-resolution crystal structure of the soluble part of EV71 2C, containing an adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) domain, a cysteine-rich zinc finger with an unusual fold, and a carboxyl-terminal helical domain. Unlike other AAA+ ATPases, EV71 2C undergoes a carboxyl terminus-mediated self-oligomerization, which is dependent on a specific interaction between the carboxyl-terminal helix of one monomer and a deep pocket formed between the ATPase and the zinc finger domains of the neighboring monomer. The carboxyl terminus-mediated self-oligomerization is fundamental to 2C ATPase activity and EV71 replication. Our findings suggest a strategy for inhibition of enterovirus replication by disruption of the self-oligomerization interface of 2C.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Guan","full_name":"Guan H","initials":"H"},{"last_name":"Tian","full_name":"Tian J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Qin","full_name":"Qin B","initials":"B"},{"last_name":"Wojdyla","full_name":"Wojdyla JA","initials":"JA"},{"last_name":"Wang","full_name":"Wang B","initials":"B"},{"last_name":"Zhao","full_name":"Zhao Z","initials":"Z"},{"last_name":"Wang","full_name":"Wang M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Cui","full_name":"Cui S","initials":"S"}],"title":"Crystal structure of 2C helicase from enterovirus 71.","pubmed_id":"28508043","type":"J","associated_entries":"5gq1","doi":"10.1126/sciadv.1602573"}]}
