We determined the single-particle cryo-electron microscopy structure of active dimeric ATP synthase from mitochondria of <i>Polytomella</i> sp. at a resolution of 2.7 to 2.8 angstroms. Separation of 13 well-defined rotary substates by three-dimensional classification provides a detailed picture of the molecular motions that accompany <i>c</i>-ring rotation and result in ATP synthesis. Crucially, the F<sub>1</sub> head rotates along with the central stalk and <i>c</i>-ring rotor for the first ~30\u00b0 of each 120\u00b0 primary rotary step to facilitate flexible coupling of the stoichiometrically mismatched F<sub>1</sub> and F<sub>o</sub> subcomplexes. Flexibility is mediated primarily by the interdomain hinge of the conserved OSCP subunit. A conserved metal ion in the proton access channel may synchronize <i>c</i>-ring protonation with rotation.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Murphy","full_name":"Murphy BJ","initials":"BJ"},{"last_name":"Klusch","full_name":"Klusch N","initials":"N"},{"last_name":"Langer","full_name":"Langer J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Mills","full_name":"Mills DJ","initials":"DJ"},{"last_name":"Yildiz","full_name":"Yildiz \u00d6","initials":"\u00d6"},{"last_name":"K\u00fchlbrandt","full_name":"K\u00fchlbrandt W","initials":"W"}],"pubmed_id":"31221832","type":"J"}]}
