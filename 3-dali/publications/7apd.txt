Here we present the cryo-EM structure of the full-length E1 helicase from papillomavirus, revealing all arms of a bound DNA replication fork and their interactions with the helicase. The replication fork junction is located at the entrance to the helicase collar ring, that sits above the AAA\u2009+\u2009motor assembly. dsDNA is escorted to and the 5\u00b4 single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) away from the unwinding point by the E1 dsDNA origin binding domains. The 3\u00b4 ssDNA interacts with six spirally-arranged \u03b2-hairpins and their cyclical top-to-bottom movement pulls the ssDNA through the helicase. Pulling of the RF against the collar ring separates the base-pairs, while modelling of the conformational cycle suggest an accompanying movement of the collar ring has an auxiliary role, helping to make efficient use of ATP in duplex unwinding.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Javed","full_name":"Javed A","initials":"A"},{"last_name":"Major","full_name":"Major B","initials":"B"},{"last_name":"Stead","full_name":"Stead JA","initials":"JA"},{"last_name":"Sanders","full_name":"Sanders CM","initials":"CM"},{"last_name":"Orlova","full_name":"Orlova EV","initials":"EV"}],"title":"Unwinding of a DNA replication fork by a hexameric viral helicase.","pubmed_id":"34545080","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1038/s41467-021-25843-6"}]}
