The polarity of the protein environment around [FeS] clusters appears to contribute largely to modulating their midpoint potentials, with local protein dipoles and water dipoles largely defining the polarity. The function of the [4Fe-4S] cluster containing Fe protein in nitrogenase catalysis is, at least in part, to serve as the nucleotide-dependent electron donor to the MoFe protein which contains the sites for substrate binding and reduction. The ability of the Fe protein to function in this manner is dependent on its ability to adopt the appropriate conformation for productive interaction with the MoFe protein and on its ability to change redox potentials to provide the driving force required for electron transfer. Phenylalanine at position 135 is located near the [4Fe-4S] cluster of nitrogenase Fe protein and has been suggested by amino acid substitution studies to participate in defining both the midpoint potential and the nucleotide-induced changes in the [4Fe-4S] cluster. In the present study, the crystal structure of the Azotobacter vinelandii nitrogenase Fe protein variant having phenylalanine at position 135 substituted by tryptophan has been determined by X-ray diffraction methods and refined to 2.4 A resolution. A comparison of available Fe protein structures not only provides a structural basis for the more positive midpoint potential observed in the tryptophan substituted variant but also suggests a possible general mechanism by which the midpoint potential could be controlled by nucleotide interactions and nitrogenase complex formation.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Jang","full_name":"Jang SB","initials":"SB"},{"last_name":"Seefeldt","full_name":"Seefeldt LC","initials":"LC"},{"last_name":"Peters","full_name":"Peters JW","initials":"JW"}],"title":"Modulating the midpoint potential of the [4Fe-4S] cluster of the nitrogenase Fe protein.","pubmed_id":"10651628","type":"J","associated_entries":"1cp2, 1n2c, 1nip, 2nip","doi":"10.1021/bi991694v"},{"journal_info":{"volume":"257","pdb_abbreviation":"Science","ISO_abbreviation":"Science","year":1992,"issue":"5077","pages":"1653-9"},"abstract":{"methods":null,"conclusions":null,"results":null,"unassigned":"The nitrogenase enzyme system catalyzes the ATP (adenosine triphosphate)-dependent reduction of dinitrogen to ammonia during the process of nitrogen fixation. Nitrogenase consists of two proteins: the iron (Fe)-protein, which couples hydrolysis of ATP to electron transfer, and the molybdenum-iron (MoFe)-protein, which contains the dinitrogen binding site. In order to address the role of ATP in nitrogen fixation, the crystal structure of the nitrogenase Fe-protein from Azotobacter vinelandii has been determined at 2.9 angstrom (A) resolution. Fe-protein is a dimer of two identical subunits that coordinate a single 4Fe:4S cluster. Each subunit folds as a single alpha/beta type domain, which together symmetrically ligate the surface exposed 4Fe:4S cluster through two cysteines from each subunit. A single bound ADP (adenosine diphosphate) molecule is located in the interface region between the two subunits. Because the phosphate groups of this nucleotide are approximately 20 A from the 4Fe:4S cluster, it is unlikely that ATP hydrolysis and electron transfer are directly coupled. Instead, it appears that interactions between the nucleotide and cluster sites must be indirectly coupled by allosteric changes occurring at the subunit interface. The coupling between protein conformation and nucleotide hydrolysis in Fe-protein exhibits general similarities to the H-Ras p21 and recA proteins that have been recently characterized structurally. The Fe-protein structure may be relevant to the functioning of other biochemical energy-transducing systems containing two nucleotide-binding sites, including membrane transport proteins.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Georgiadis","full_name":"Georgiadis MM","initials":"MM"},{"last_name":"Komiya","full_name":"Komiya H","initials":"H"},{"last_name":"Chakrabarti","full_name":"Chakrabarti P","initials":"P"},{"last_name":"Woo","full_name":"Woo D","initials":"D"},{"last_name":"Kornuc","full_name":"Kornuc JJ","initials":"JJ"},{"last_name":"Rees","full_name":"Rees DC","initials":"DC"}],"title":"Crystallographic structure of the nitrogenase iron protein from Azotobacter vinelandii.","pubmed_id":"1529353","type":"J","associated_entries":"1cp2, 1n2c, 1nip, 2nip","doi":"10.1126/science.1529353"},{"journal_info":{"volume":"280","pdb_abbreviation":"J Mol Biol","ISO_abbreviation":"J Mol Biol","year":1998,"issue":"4","pages":"669-85"},"abstract":{"methods":null,"conclusions":null,"results":null,"unassigned":"The nitrogenase iron (Fe) protein performs multiple functions during biological nitrogen fixation, including mediating the mechanistically essential coupling between ATP hydrolysis and electron transfer to the nitrogenase molybdenum iron (MoFe) protein during substrate reduction, and participating in the biosynthesis and insertion of the FeMo-cofactor into the MoFe-protein. To establish a structural framework for addressing the diverse functions of Fe-protein, crystal structures of the Fe-proteins from Azotobacter vinelandii and Clostridium pasteurianum have been determined at resolutions of 2.2 A and 1.93 A, respectively. These two Fe-proteins are among the more diverse in terms of amino acid sequence and biochemical properties. As described initially for the A. vinelandii Fe-protein in a different crystal form at 2.9 A resolution, each subunit of the dimeric Fe-protein adopts a polypeptide fold related to other mononucleotide-binding proteins such as G-proteins, with the two subunits bridged by a 4Fe:4S cluster. The overall similarities in the subunit fold and dimer arrangement observed in the structures of the A. vinelandii and C. pasteurianum Fe-proteins indicate that they are representative of the conformation of free Fe-protein that is not in complex with nucleotide or the MoFe-protein. Residues in the cluster and nucleotide-binding sites are linked by a network of conserved hydrogen bonds, salt-bridges and water molecules that may conformationally couple these regions. Significant variability is observed in localized regions, especially near the 4Fe:4S cluster and the MoFe-protein binding surface, that change conformation upon formation of the ADP.AlF4- stabilized complex with the MoFe-protein. A core of 140 conserved residues is identified in an alignment of 59 Fe-protein sequences that may be useful for the identification of homologous proteins with functions comparable to that of Fe-protein in non-nitrogen fixing systems.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Schlessman","full_name":"Schlessman JL","initials":"JL"},{"last_name":"Woo","full_name":"Woo D","initials":"D"},{"last_name":"Joshua-Tor","full_name":"Joshua-Tor L","initials":"L"},{"last_name":"Howard","full_name":"Howard JB","initials":"JB"},{"last_name":"Rees","full_name":"Rees DC","initials":"DC"}],"title":"Conformational variability in structures of the nitrogenase iron proteins from Azotobacter vinelandii and Clostridium pasteurianum.","pubmed_id":"9677296","type":"J","associated_entries":"1cp2, 1n2c, 1nip, 2nip","doi":"10.1006/jmbi.1998.1898"},{"journal_info":{"volume":"387","pdb_abbreviation":"Nature","ISO_abbreviation":"Nature","year":1997,"issue":"6631","pages":"370-6"},"abstract":{"methods":null,"conclusions":null,"results":null,"unassigned":"The coupling of ATP hydrolysis to electron transfer by the enzyme nitrogenase during biological nitrogen fixation is an important example of a nucleotide-dependent transduction mechanism.
