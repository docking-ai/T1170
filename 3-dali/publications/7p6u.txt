The N-terminal domain of Lon facilitates substrate recognition, but how the domains confer such activity has remained unclear. Here, we report the full-length structure of Lon protease from Thermus\u2009thermophilus at 3.9\u2009\u00c5 resolution in a substrate-engaged state. The six N-terminal domains are arranged in three pairs, stabilized by coiled-coil segments and forming an additional channel for substrate sensing and entry into the AAA+ ring. Sequence conservation analysis and proteolysis assays confirm that this architecture is required for the degradation of both folded and unfolded substrates in bacteria.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Coscia","full_name":"Coscia F","initials":"F"},{"last_name":"L\u00f6we","full_name":"L\u00f6we J","initials":"J"}],"pubmed_id":"34591981","type":"J"}]}
