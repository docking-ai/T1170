Two AAA+ nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) power polypeptide translocation through a central channel comprised of a hexameric spiral of protomers that contact substrate via conserved pore-loop interactions. Here we report cryo-EM structures of a hyperactive ClpB variant bound to the model substrate, casein in the presence of slowly hydrolysable ATP\u03b3S, which reveal the translocation mechanism. Distinct substrate-gripping interactions are identified for NBD1 and NBD2 pore loops. A trimer of N-terminal domains define a channel entrance that binds the polypeptide substrate adjacent to\u00a0the topmost NBD1 contact. NBD conformations at the seam interface reveal how ATP hydrolysis-driven substrate disengagement and re-binding are precisely tuned to drive a directional, stepwise translocation cycle.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Rizo","full_name":"Rizo AN","initials":"AN"},{"last_name":"Lin","full_name":"Lin J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Gates","full_name":"Gates SN","initials":"SN"},{"last_name":"Tse","full_name":"Tse E","initials":"E"},{"last_name":"Bart","full_name":"Bart SM","initials":"SM"},{"last_name":"Castellano","full_name":"Castellano LM","initials":"LM"},{"last_name":"DiMaio","full_name":"DiMaio F","initials":"F"},{"last_name":"Shorter","full_name":"Shorter J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Southworth","full_name":"Southworth DR","initials":"DR"}],"pubmed_id":"31160557","type":"J"}]}
