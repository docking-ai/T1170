AphA activates transcription by an unusual mechanism that appears to involve a direct interaction with the LysR-type regulator AphB at the tcpPH promoter. As a first step toward understanding the molecular basis for tcpPH activation by AphA and AphB, we have determined the crystal structure of AphA to 2.2 angstrom resolution. AphA is a dimer with an N-terminal winged helix DNA binding domain that is architecturally similar to that of the MarR family of transcriptional regulators. Unlike this family, however, AphA has a unique C-terminal antiparallel coiled coil domain that serves as its primary dimerization interface. AphA monomers are highly unstable by themselves and form a linked topology, requiring the protein to partially unfold to form the dimer. The structure of AphA also provides insights into how it cooperates with AphB to activate transcription, most likely by forming a heterotetrameric complex at the tcpPH promoter.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"De Silva","full_name":"De Silva RS","initials":"RS"},{"last_name":"Kovacikova","full_name":"Kovacikova G","initials":"G"},{"last_name":"Lin","full_name":"Lin W","initials":"W"},{"last_name":"Taylor","full_name":"Taylor RK","initials":"RK"},{"last_name":"Skorupski","full_name":"Skorupski K","initials":"K"},{"last_name":"Kull","full_name":"Kull FJ","initials":"FJ"}],"pubmed_id":"15647287","type":"J"}]}
