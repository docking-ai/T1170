How Msp1 selects its substrates and firmly engages them during the energetically unfavorable extraction process remains a mystery. To address this question, we solved cryo-EM structures of Msp1-substrate complexes at near-atomic resolution. Akin to other AAA proteins, Msp1 forms hexameric spirals that translocate substrates through a central pore. A singular hydrophobic substrate recruitment site is exposed at the spiral's seam, which we propose positions the substrate for entry into the pore. There, a tight web of aromatic amino acids grips the substrate in a sequence-promiscuous, hydrophobic milieu. Elements at the intersubunit interfaces coordinate ATP hydrolysis with the subunits' positions in the spiral. We present a comprehensive model of Msp1's mechanism, which follows general architectural principles established for other AAA proteins yet specializes Msp1 for its unique role in membrane protein extraction.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Wang","full_name":"Wang L","initials":"L"},{"last_name":"Myasnikov","full_name":"Myasnikov A","initials":"A"},{"last_name":"Pan","full_name":"Pan X","initials":"X"},{"last_name":"Walter","full_name":"Walter P","initials":"P"}],"title":"Structure of the AAA protein Msp1 reveals mechanism of mislocalized membrane protein extraction.","pubmed_id":"31999255","type":"J","associated_entries":"6pdw, 6pdy","doi":"10.7554/eLife.54031"}]}
