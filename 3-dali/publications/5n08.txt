We report the 1.95\u2009\u00c5 resolution crystal structure of dimeric holo-ScNsrR and show that the cluster is coordinated by the three invariant Cys residues from one monomer and, unexpectedly, Asp8 from the other. A cavity map suggests that NO displaces Asp8 as a cluster ligand and, while D8A and D8C variants remain NO sensitive, DNA binding is affected. A structural comparison of holo-ScNsrR with an apo-IscR-DNA complex shows that the [4Fe-4S] cluster stabilizes a turn between ScNsrR Cys93 and Cys99 properly oriented to interact with the DNA backbone. In addition, an apo ScNsrR structure suggests that Asn97 from this turn, along with Arg12, which forms a salt-bridge with Asp8, are instrumental in modulating the position of the DNA recognition helix region relative to its major groove.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Volbeda","full_name":"Volbeda A","initials":"A"},{"last_name":"Dodd","full_name":"Dodd EL","initials":"EL"},{"last_name":"Darnault","full_name":"Darnault C","initials":"C"},{"last_name":"Crack","full_name":"Crack JC","initials":"JC"},{"last_name":"Renoux","full_name":"Renoux O","initials":"O"},{"last_name":"Hutchings","full_name":"Hutchings MI","initials":"MI"},{"last_name":"Le Brun","full_name":"Le Brun NE","initials":"NE"},{"last_name":"Fontecilla-Camps","full_name":"Fontecilla-Camps JC","initials":"JC"}],"title":"Crystal structures of the NO sensor NsrR reveal how its iron-sulfur cluster modulates DNA binding.","pubmed_id":"28425466","type":"J","associated_entries":"5n07","doi":"10.1038/ncomms15052"}]}
