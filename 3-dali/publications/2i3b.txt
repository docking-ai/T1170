The resulting hits were further screened for recombinant expression, solubility and protein aggregation, which led to the identification of the previously unknown human cancer-related (HCR) protein encoded by the mRNA NM_032324 as a target for structure determination by NMR. The three-dimensional structure of the protein in its complex with ATPgammaS forms a three-layered alpha/beta sandwich, with a central nine-stranded beta-sheet surrounded by five alpha-helices. Sequence and three-dimensional structure comparisons with AAA+ ATPases revealed the presence of Walker A (GPPGVGKT) and Walker B (VCVIDEIG) motifs. Using 1D (31)P-NMR spectroscopy and a coupled enzymatic assay for the determination of inorganic phosphate, we showed that the purified recombinant protein is active as a non-specific nucleoside triphosphatase, with k(cat)=7.6x10(-3) s(-1). The structural basis for the enzymatic activity of HCR-NTPase was further characterized by site-directed mutagenesis of the Walker B motif, which further contributes to making the HCR-NTPase an attractive new target for further biochemical characterization in the context of its presumed role in human tumorigenesis.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Placzek","full_name":"Placzek WJ","initials":"WJ"},{"last_name":"Almeida","full_name":"Almeida MS","initials":"MS"},{"last_name":"W\u00fcthrich","full_name":"W\u00fcthrich K","initials":"K"}],"title":"NMR structure and functional characterization of a human cancer-related nucleoside triphosphatase.","pubmed_id":"17291528","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1016/j.jmb.2007.01.001"}]}
