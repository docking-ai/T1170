New crystal structures reveal that residues in the intermediate domain of the HslU<sub>6</sub> unfoldase can plug its axial channel, blocking productive substrate binding and subsequent unfolding, translocation, and degradation by the HslV<sub>12</sub> peptidase. Biochemical experiments with wild-type and mutant enzymes support a model in which heat-induced melting of this autoinhibitory plug activates HslUV proteolysis.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Baytshtok","full_name":"Baytshtok V","initials":"V"},{"last_name":"Fei","full_name":"Fei X","initials":"X"},{"last_name":"Shih","full_name":"Shih TT","initials":"TT"},{"last_name":"Grant","full_name":"Grant RA","initials":"RA"},{"last_name":"Santos","full_name":"Santos JC","initials":"JC"},{"last_name":"Baker","full_name":"Baker TA","initials":"TA"},{"last_name":"Sauer","full_name":"Sauer RT","initials":"RT"}],"title":"Heat activates the AAA+ HslUV protease by melting an axial autoinhibitory plug.","pubmed_id":"33472065","type":"J","associated_entries":"6pxi, 6pxk","doi":"10.1016/j.celrep.2020.108639"}]}
