The SlyA family, which includes SlyA, Rap, Hor, and RovA proteins, is widely distributed in bacterial and archaeal genomes. Current evidence suggests that SlyA-like factors act as repressors, activators, and modulators of gene transcription. These proteins have been shown to up-regulate the expression of molecular chaperones, acid-resistance proteins, and cytolysin, and down-regulate several biosynthetic enzymes. The structure of SlyA from Enterococcus faecalis, determined as a part of an ongoing structural genomics initiative (www.mcsg.anl.gov), revealed the same winged helix DNA-binding motif that was recently found in the MarR repressor from Escherichia coli and the MexR repressor from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a sequence homologue of MarR. Phylogenetic analysis of the MarR/SlyA family suggests that Sly is placed between the SlyA and MarR subfamilies and shows significant sequence similarity to members of both subfamilies.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Wu","full_name":"Wu RY","initials":"RY"},{"last_name":"Zhang","full_name":"Zhang RG","initials":"RG"},{"last_name":"Zagnitko","full_name":"Zagnitko O","initials":"O"},{"last_name":"Dementieva","full_name":"Dementieva I","initials":"I"},{"last_name":"Maltzev","full_name":"Maltzev N","initials":"N"},{"last_name":"Watson","full_name":"Watson JD","initials":"JD"},{"last_name":"Laskowski","full_name":"Laskowski R","initials":"R"},{"last_name":"Gornicki","full_name":"Gornicki P","initials":"P"},{"last_name":"Joachimiak","full_name":"Joachimiak A","initials":"A"}],"title":"Crystal structure of Enterococcus faecalis SlyA-like transcriptional factor.","pubmed_id":"12649270","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1074/jbc.M300292200"}]}
