XPD is a superfamily-2 5'-3' helicase containing an iron-sulphur cluster. Its helicase activity is indispensable for NER and it plays a role in the damage verification process. Here, we report the first structure of XPD from Thermoplasma acidophilum (taXPD) in complex with a short DNA fragment, thus revealing the polarity of the translocated strand and providing insights into how the enzyme achieves its 5'-3' directionality. Accompanied by a detailed mutational and biochemical analysis of taXPD, we define the path of the translocated DNA strand through the protein and identify amino acids that are critical for protein function.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Kuper","full_name":"Kuper J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Wolski","full_name":"Wolski SC","initials":"SC"},{"last_name":"Michels","full_name":"Michels G","initials":"G"},{"last_name":"Kisker","full_name":"Kisker C","initials":"C"}],"title":"Functional and structural studies of the nucleotide excision repair helicase XPD suggest a polarity for DNA translocation.","pubmed_id":"22081108","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1038/emboj.2011.374"}]}
