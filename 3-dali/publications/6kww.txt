HslV is a threonine (Thr) protease employing the N-terminal Thr residue in the mature protein as the catalytic residue. To date, HslUV from Gram-negative bacteria has been extensively studied. However, the mechanisms of action and activation of HslUV from Gram-positive bacteria, which have an additional N-terminal sequence before the catalytic Thr residue, remain to be revealed. In this study, we determined the crystal structures of HslV from the Gram-positive bacterium <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> with and without HslU in the crystallization conditions. The structural comparison suggested that a structural transition to the symmetric form of HslV was triggered by ATP-bound HslU. More importantly, the additional N-terminal sequence was cleaved in the presence of HslU and ATP, exposing the Thr9 residue at the N-terminus and activating the ATP-dependent protease activity. Further biochemical studies demonstrated that the exposed N-terminal Thr residue is critical for catalysis with binding to the symmetric HslU hexamer. Since eukaryotic proteasomes have a similar additional N-terminal sequence, our results will improve our understanding of the common molecular mechanisms for the activation of proteasomes.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Jeong","full_name":"Jeong S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Ahn","full_name":"Ahn J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Kwon","full_name":"Kwon AR","initials":"AR"},{"last_name":"Ha","full_name":"Ha NC","initials":"NC"}],"title":"Cleavage-Dependent Activation of ATP-Dependent Protease HslUV from <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>.","pubmed_id":"32694241","type":"J","associated_entries":"6kr1, 6kui","doi":"10.14348/molcells.2020.0074"}]}
