The 2.7/3.0 A crystal structure of gamma complex reveals a pentameric arrangement of subunits, with stoichiometry delta':gamma(3):delta. The C-terminal domains of the subunits form a circular collar that supports an asymmetric arrangement of the N-terminal ATP binding domains of the gamma motor and the structurally related domains of the delta' stator and the delta wrench. The structure suggests a mechanism by which the gamma complex switches between a closed state, in which the beta-interacting element of delta is hidden by delta', and an open form similar to the crystal structure, in which delta is free to bind to beta.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Jeruzalmi","full_name":"Jeruzalmi D","initials":"D"},{"last_name":"O'Donnell","full_name":"O'Donnell M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Kuriyan","full_name":"Kuriyan J","initials":"J"}],"title":"Crystal structure of the processivity clamp loader gamma (gamma) complex of E. coli DNA polymerase III.","pubmed_id":"11525729","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1016/S0092-8674(01)00463-9"}]}
