DSBs are repaired in a stepwise manner by homologous recombination. Here, we focused on the early steps of DSB repair, including DSB recognition, which is still only poorly understood. In prokaryotes, this process has been proposed to involve the RecN protein, a member of the structural maintenance of chromosome (SMC) protein family, which include key eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteins such as cohesin, condensin, and Rad50. An extensive high- and low-resolution structural analysis of Deinococcus radiodurans RecN using\u00a0a combination of protein crystallography and small-angle X-ray scattering enabled us to assemble\u00a0a quasi-atomic model of the entire RecN protein, representing the complete structure of a SMC-like protein. These results, together with a thorough biochemical and mutational study of RecN, allow us to propose a model for the role of RecN in DSB repair.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Pellegrino","full_name":"Pellegrino S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Radzimanowski","full_name":"Radzimanowski J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"de Sanctis","full_name":"de Sanctis D","initials":"D"},{"last_name":"Erba","full_name":"Erba EB","initials":"EB"},{"last_name":"McSweeney","full_name":"McSweeney S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Timmins","full_name":"Timmins J","initials":"J"}],"title":"Structural and Functional Characterization of an SMC-like Protein RecN: New Insights into Double-Strand Break Repair.","pubmed_id":"23085075","type":"J","associated_entries":"4abx, 4ad8","doi":"10.1016/j.str.2012.09.010"}]}
