We report the cryo-EM structure of the Chaetomium thermophilum 90S pre-ribosome, revealing how a network of biogenesis factors including 19 \u03b2-propellers and large \u03b1-solenoid proteins engulfs the pre-rRNA. Within the 90S\u00a0pre-ribosome, we identify the UTP-A, UTP-B, Mpp10-Imp3-Imp4, Bms1-Rcl1, and U3 snoRNP modules, which are organized around 5'-ETS and partially folded 18S rRNA. The U3 snoRNP is strategically positioned at the center of the 90S particle to perform its multiple tasks during pre-rRNA folding and processing. The architecture of the elusive 90S pre-ribosome gives unprecedented structural insight into the early steps of pre-rRNA maturation. Nascent rRNA that is co-transcriptionally folded and given a particular shape by encapsulation within a dedicated mold-like structure is reminiscent of how polypeptides use chaperone chambers for their protein folding.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Kornprobst","full_name":"Kornprobst M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Turk","full_name":"Turk M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Kellner","full_name":"Kellner N","initials":"N"},{"last_name":"Cheng","full_name":"Cheng J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Flemming","full_name":"Flemming D","initials":"D"},{"last_name":"Ko\u0161-Braun","full_name":"Ko\u0161-Braun I","initials":"I"},{"last_name":"Ko\u0161","full_name":"Ko\u0161 M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Thoms","full_name":"Thoms M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Berninghausen","full_name":"Berninghausen O","initials":"O"},{"last_name":"Beckmann","full_name":"Beckmann R","initials":"R"},{"last_name":"Hurt","full_name":"Hurt E","initials":"E"}],"title":"Architecture of the 90S Pre-ribosome: A Structural View on the Birth of the Eukaryotic Ribosome.","pubmed_id":"27419870","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1016/j.cell.2016.06.014"}]}
