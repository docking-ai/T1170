ATP-binding cassette subfamily F member 1 (ABCF1) plays a key role in the accuracy of start codon selection. However, the function of human ABCF1 is not clearly understood. Here, we solve the crystal structure of an ATP-bound wild-type human ABCF1 at 2.3-\u00c5 resolution. The comparative studies indicate that the structure is in a pre-activation intermediate conformation. This conformation is stabilized by the interaction between ATP and protein. Thus, we propose that this conformation is an important step in the activation of ABCF1. This study extends our understanding of ABC (ATP-binding cassette) protein activation at the molecular level.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Qu","full_name":"Qu L","initials":"L"},{"last_name":"Jiang","full_name":"Jiang Y","initials":"Y"},{"last_name":"Cheng","full_name":"Cheng C","initials":"C"},{"last_name":"Wu","full_name":"Wu D","initials":"D"},{"last_name":"Meng","full_name":"Meng B","initials":"B"},{"last_name":"Chen","full_name":"Chen Z","initials":"Z"},{"last_name":"Zhu","full_name":"Zhu Y","initials":"Y"},{"last_name":"Shaw","full_name":"Shaw N","initials":"N"},{"last_name":"Ouyang","full_name":"Ouyang S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Liu","full_name":"Liu ZJ","initials":"ZJ"}],"title":"Crystal Structure of ATP-Bound Human ABCF1 Demonstrates a Unique Conformation of ABC Proteins.","pubmed_id":"30017566","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1016/j.str.2018.05.019"}]}
