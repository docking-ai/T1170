UDP-MurNAc-tripeptide ligase (MurE) is a member of the ATP-dependent ligase family, which incorporate amino acids including meso-diaminopimelic acid (m-DAP) into peptidoglycan during synthesis in a species-specific manner. In the present study, we have cloned, over-expressed, and characterised MurE from M. tuberculosis (Mtb-MurE). The crystal structure has been determined at 3.0A resolution in the presence of the substrate UDP-MurNAc-l-Ala-d-Glu (UAG). The activity of the enzyme was measured through estimating inorganic phosphate released in a non-radioactive high-throughput colourimetric assay. UDP-MurNAc-l-Ala-d-Glu-m-DAP (UMT) formation coupled to inorganic phosphate release was confirmed by HPLC and mass spectrometric analyses. Kinetic constants were determined for a range of natural substrates using optimised conditions. From our findings, it is evident that Mtb-MurE is highly specific in adding m-DAP to UDP-MurNAc-dipeptide and ATP-hydrolysis is an absolute requirement for its activity.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Basavannacharya","full_name":"Basavannacharya C","initials":"C"},{"last_name":"Robertson","full_name":"Robertson G","initials":"G"},{"last_name":"Munshi","full_name":"Munshi T","initials":"T"},{"last_name":"Keep","full_name":"Keep NH","initials":"NH"},{"last_name":"Bhakta","full_name":"Bhakta S","initials":"S"}],"title":"ATP-dependent MurE ligase in Mycobacterium tuberculosis: biochemical and structural characterisation.","pubmed_id":"19945347","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1016/j.tube.2009.10.007"}]}
