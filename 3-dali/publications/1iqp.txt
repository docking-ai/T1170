The eukaryotic RFC is a complex consisting of one large and four small subunits. We have determined the crystal structure of the clamp loader small subunit (RFCS) from Pyrococcus furiosus. The six subunits, of which four bind ADP in their canonical nucleotide binding clefts, assemble into a dimer of semicircular trimers. The crescent-like architecture of each subunit formed by the three domains resembles that of the delta' subunit of the E. coli clamp loader. The trimeric architecture of archaeal RFCS, with its mobile N-terminal domains, involves intersubunit interactions that may be conserved in eukaryotic functional complexes.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Oyama","full_name":"Oyama T","initials":"T"},{"last_name":"Ishino","full_name":"Ishino Y","initials":"Y"},{"last_name":"Cann","full_name":"Cann IK","initials":"IK"},{"last_name":"Ishino","full_name":"Ishino S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Morikawa","full_name":"Morikawa K","initials":"K"}],"title":"Atomic structure of the clamp loader small subunit from Pyrococcus furiosus.","pubmed_id":"11545747","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1016/S1097-2765(01)00328-8"},{"journal_info":{"volume":"183","pdb_abbreviation":"J Bacteriol","ISO_abbreviation":"J.

The function of RFC is to load PCNA, a processivity factor of eukaryotic DNA polymerases delta and epsilon, onto primed DNA templates. RFC-like genes, arranged in tandem in the Pyrococcus furiosus genome, were cloned and expressed individually in Escherichia coli cells to determine their roles in DNA synthesis. The P. furiosus RFC (PfuRFC) consists of a small subunit (RFCS) and a large subunit (RFCL). Highly purified RFCS possesses an ATPase activity, which was stimulated up to twofold in the presence of both single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and P. furiosus PCNA (PfuPCNA). The ATPase activity of PfuRFC itself was as strong as that of RFCS. However, in the presence of PfuPCNA and ssDNA, PfuRFC exhibited a 10-fold increase in ATPase activity under the same conditions. RFCL formed very large complexes by itself and had an extremely weak ATPase activity, which was not stimulated by PfuPCNA and DNA. The PfuRFC stimulated PfuPCNA-dependent DNA synthesis by both polymerase I and polymerase II from P. furiosus. We propose that PfuRFC is required for efficient loading of PfuPCNA and that the role of RFC in processive DNA synthesis is conserved in Archaea and Eucarya.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Cann","full_name":"Cann IK","initials":"IK"},{"last_name":"Ishino","full_name":"Ishino S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Yuasa","full_name":"Yuasa M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Daiyasu","full_name":"Daiyasu H","initials":"H"},{"last_name":"Toh","full_name":"Toh H","initials":"H"},{"last_name":"Ishino","full_name":"Ishino Y","initials":"Y"}],"title":"Biochemical analysis of replication factor C from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus.","pubmed_id":"11274122","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1128/JB.183.8.2614-2623.2001"},{"journal_info":{"volume":"134","pdb_abbreviation":"J Struct Biol","ISO_abbreviation":"J.

We have investigated the oligomeric structure of RFCS from Pyrococcus furiosus by electron microscopy using single-particle analysis. RFCS forms mostly ring-shaped hexamers at pH 9.0, although it tends to form C-shaped tetramers or pentamers at a lower pH (pH 5.5). The three-dimensional (3D) structure of the RFCS hexamer was obtained by random conical tilt reconstruction at 24.0-A resolution. RFCS forms a hexameric ring with outer and inner diameters of 117 and 27 A, respectively, and with a height of about 55 A. The six subunits are arranged in a twisted manner with a sixfold symmetry around the channel. The 3D map revealed that the six subunits are arranged in a head-to-tail configuration. Although the RFC complex consists of RFCS and RFCL in vivo, RFCS alone, together with PCNA, substantially enhanced the DNA synthesizing activity of P. furiosus DNA polymerase I in vitro. The 3D reconstruction of RFCS with catalytic activity provides important insights into the organization mechanism and the functional state of the RFC complex.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Mayanagi","full_name":"Mayanagi K","initials":"K"},{"last_name":"Miyata","full_name":"Miyata T","initials":"T"},{"last_name":"Oyama","full_name":"Oyama T","initials":"T"},{"last_name":"Ishino","full_name":"Ishino Y","initials":"Y"},{"last_name":"Morikawa","full_name":"Morikawa K","initials":"K"}],"title":"Three-dimensional electron microscopy of the clamp loader small subunit from Pyrococcus furiosus.","pubmed_id":"11469875","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1006/jsbi.2001.4357"}]}
