However, in our times of widespread resistance, the diversity of peptidoglycan modifications offers a variety of new antibacterials targets. In some Gram-positive species such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, or Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the second residue of the peptidoglycan precursor, D-glutamate, is amidated into iso-D-glutamine by the essential amidotransferase MurT/GatD complex. Here, we present the structure of this complex at 3.0\u2009\u00c5 resolution. MurT has central and C-terminal domains similar to Mur ligases with a cysteine-rich insertion, which probably binds zinc, contributing to the interface with GatD. The mechanism of amidation by MurT is likely similar to the condensation catalyzed by Mur ligases. GatD is a glutaminase providing ammonia that is likely channeled to the MurT active site through a cavity network. The structure and assay presented here constitute a knowledge base for future drug development studies.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Morlot","full_name":"Morlot C","initials":"C"},{"last_name":"Straume","full_name":"Straume D","initials":"D"},{"last_name":"Peters","full_name":"Peters K","initials":"K"},{"last_name":"Hegnar","full_name":"Hegnar OA","initials":"OA"},{"last_name":"Simon","full_name":"Simon N","initials":"N"},{"last_name":"Villard","full_name":"Villard AM","initials":"AM"},{"last_name":"Contreras-Martel","full_name":"Contreras-Martel C","initials":"C"},{"last_name":"Leisico","full_name":"Leisico F","initials":"F"},{"last_name":"Breukink","full_name":"Breukink E","initials":"E"},{"last_name":"Gravier-Pelletier","full_name":"Gravier-Pelletier C","initials":"C"},{"last_name":"Le Corre","full_name":"Le Corre L","initials":"L"},{"last_name":"Vollmer","full_name":"Vollmer W","initials":"W"},{"last_name":"Pietrancosta","full_name":"Pietrancosta N","initials":"N"},{"last_name":"H\u00e5varstein","full_name":"H\u00e5varstein LS","initials":"LS"},{"last_name":"Zapun","full_name":"Zapun A","initials":"A"}],"title":"Structure of the essential peptidoglycan amidotransferase MurT/GatD complex from Streptococcus pneumoniae.","pubmed_id":"30093673","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1038/s41467-018-05602-w"}]}
