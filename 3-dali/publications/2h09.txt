The expression of the toxin gene (tox) is regulated by the repressor DtxR, which is activated by transition metal ions. X-ray crystal structures of DtxR with and without (apo-form) its coordinated transition metal ion have established the general architecture of the repressor, identified the location of the metal-binding sites, and revealed a metal-ion-triggered subunit-subunit 'caliper-like' conformational change. Here we report the three-dimensional crystal structure of the complex between a biologically active Ni(II)-bound DtxR(C102D) mutant, in which a cysteine is replaced by an aspartate at residue 102, and a 33-base-pair DNA segment containing the toxin operator toxO. This structure shows that DNA interacts with two dimeric repressor proteins bound to opposite sides of the tox operator. We propose that a metal-ion-induced helix-to-coil structural transition in the amino-terminal region of the protein is partly responsible for the unique mode of repressor activation by transition metal ions.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"White","full_name":"White A","initials":"A"},{"last_name":"Ding","full_name":"Ding X","initials":"X"},{"last_name":"vanderSpek","full_name":"vanderSpek JC","initials":"JC"},{"last_name":"Murphy","full_name":"Murphy JR","initials":"JR"},{"last_name":"Ringe","full_name":"Ringe D","initials":"D"}],"title":"Structure of the metal-ion-activated diphtheria toxin repressor/tox operator complex.","pubmed_id":"9697776","type":"J","associated_entries":"1ddn, 1on1, 1on2, 2tdx","doi":"10.1038/28893"},{"journal_info":{"volume":"10","pdb_abbreviation":"Nat.

A member of the diphtheria toxin repressor (DtxR) family of metalloregulatory proteins, MntR exhibits selectivity for Mn2+ over Fe2+. Replacement of a metal-binding residue, Asp8, with methionine (D8M) relaxes this specificity. We report here the X-ray crystal structures of wild-type MntR and the D8M mutant bound to manganese with 1.75 A and 1.61 A resolution, respectively. The 142-residue MntR homodimer has substantial structural similarity to the 226-residue DtxR but lacks the C-terminal SH3-like domain of DtxR. The metal-binding pockets of MntR and DtxR are substantially different. The cation-to-cation distance between the two manganese ions bound by MntR is 3.3 A, whereas that between the metal ions bound by DtxR is 9 A. D8M binds only a single Mn2+ per monomer, owing to alteration of the metal-binding site. The sole retained metal site adopts pseudo-hexacoordinate geometry rather than the pseudo-heptacoordinate geometry of the MntR metal sites.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Glasfeld","full_name":"Glasfeld A","initials":"A"},{"last_name":"Guedon","full_name":"Guedon E","initials":"E"},{"last_name":"Helmann","full_name":"Helmann JD","initials":"JD"},{"last_name":"Brennan","full_name":"Brennan RG","initials":"RG"}],"title":"Structure of the manganese-bound manganese transport regulator of Bacillus subtilis.","pubmed_id":"12847518","type":"J","associated_entries":"1ddn, 1on1, 1on2, 2tdx","doi":"10.1038/nsb951"}]}
