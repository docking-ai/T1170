Each Cdc48 hexamer contains two stacked ATPase rings (D1 and D2) and six N-terminal (N) domains. Cdc48 binds various cofactors, including the Ufd1-Npl4 heterodimer. Here, we report structures of the Cdc48-Ufd1-Npl4 complex from Chaetomium thermophilum. Npl4 interacts through its UBX-like domain with a Cdc48 N domain, and it uses two Zn<sub>2+</sub>-finger domains to anchor the enzymatically inactive Mpr1-Pad1 N-terminal (MPN) domain, homologous to domains found in several isopeptidases, to the top of the D1 ATPase ring. The MPN domain of Npl4 is located above Cdc48's central pore, a position similar to the MPN domain from deubiquitinase Rpn11 in the proteasome. Our results indicate that Npl4 is unique among Cdc48 cofactors and suggest a mechanism for binding and translocation of polyubiquitinated substrates into the ATPase.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Bodnar","full_name":"Bodnar NO","initials":"NO"},{"last_name":"Kim","full_name":"Kim KH","initials":"KH"},{"last_name":"Ji","full_name":"Ji Z","initials":"Z"},{"last_name":"Wales","full_name":"Wales TE","initials":"TE"},{"last_name":"Svetlov","full_name":"Svetlov V","initials":"V"},{"last_name":"Nudler","full_name":"Nudler E","initials":"E"},{"last_name":"Engen","full_name":"Engen JR","initials":"JR"},{"last_name":"Walz","full_name":"Walz T","initials":"T"},{"last_name":"Rapoport","full_name":"Rapoport TA","initials":"TA"}],"title":"Structure of the Cdc48 ATPase with its ubiquitin-binding cofactor Ufd1-Npl4.","pubmed_id":"29967539","type":"J","associated_entries":"6cdd","doi":"10.1038/s41594-018-0085-x"}]}
