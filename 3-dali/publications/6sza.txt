Here, we show that inside the LdcI-RavA cage, RavA hexamers adopt an asymmetric spiral conformation in which the nucleotide-free seam is constrained to two opposite orientations. Cryo-EM reconstructions of free RavA reveal two co-existing structural states: an asymmetric spiral, and a flat C2-symmetric closed ring characterised by two nucleotide-free seams. The closed ring RavA state bears close structural similarity to the pseudo two-fold symmetric crystal structure of the AAA+ unfoldase ClpX, suggesting a common ATPase mechanism. Based on these structures, and in light of the current knowledge regarding AAA+ ATPases, we propose different scenarios for the ATP hydrolysis cycle of free RavA and the LdcI-RavA cage-like complex, and extend the comparison to other AAA+ ATPases of clade 7.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Jessop","full_name":"Jessop M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Arragain","full_name":"Arragain B","initials":"B"},{"last_name":"Miras","full_name":"Miras R","initials":"R"},{"last_name":"Fraudeau","full_name":"Fraudeau A","initials":"A"},{"last_name":"Huard","full_name":"Huard K","initials":"K"},{"last_name":"Bacia-Verloop","full_name":"Bacia-Verloop M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Catty","full_name":"Catty P","initials":"P"},{"last_name":"Felix","full_name":"Felix J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Malet","full_name":"Malet H","initials":"H"},{"last_name":"Gutsche","full_name":"Gutsche I","initials":"I"}],"pubmed_id":"31992852","type":"J"}]}
