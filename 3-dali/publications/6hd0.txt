Recently, the UBX domain-containing cofactors Arabidopsis thaliana PUX1 and human alveolar soft part sarcoma locus (ASPL) were reported to bind and disassemble the cognate AAA+ ATPases AtCDC48 and human p97. Here, we present two crystal structures related to these complexes: a truncated AtCDC48 (AtCDC48-ND1) and a hybrid complex containing human p97-ND1 and the UBX domain of plant PUX1 (p97-ND1:PUX1-UBX). These structures reveal close similarity between the human and plant AAA+ ATPases, but also highlight differences between disassembling and non-disassembling AAA+ ATPase cofactors. Based on an AtCDC48 disassembly assay with PUX1 and known crystal structures of the p97-bound human cofactor ASPL, we propose a general ATPase disassembly model. Thus, our structural and biophysical investigations provide detailed insight into the mechanism of AAA+ ATPase disassembly by UBX domain cofactors and suggest a general mode of regulating the cellular activity of these molecular machines.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Banchenko","full_name":"Banchenko S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Arumughan","full_name":"Arumughan A","initials":"A"},{"last_name":"Petrovi\u0107","full_name":"Petrovi\u0107 S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Schwefel","full_name":"Schwefel D","initials":"D"},{"last_name":"Wanker","full_name":"Wanker EE","initials":"EE"},{"last_name":"Roske","full_name":"Roske Y","initials":"Y"},{"last_name":"Heinemann","full_name":"Heinemann U","initials":"U"}],"title":"Common Mode of Remodeling AAA ATPases p97/CDC48 by Their Disassembling Cofactors ASPL/PUX1.","pubmed_id":"31648844","type":"J","associated_entries":"6hd3","doi":"10.1016/j.str.2019.10.001"}]}
