Here, we report the generation of a quantitative interaction network, directly linking 14 human proteins to the AAA+ ATPase p97, an essential hexameric protein with multiple cellular functions. We show that the high-affinity interacting protein ASPL efficiently promotes p97 hexamer disassembly, resulting in the formation of stable p97:ASPL heterotetramers. High-resolution structural and biochemical studies indicate that an extended UBX domain (eUBX) in ASPL is critical for p97 hexamer disassembly and facilitates the assembly of p97:ASPL heterotetramers. This spontaneous process is accompanied by a reorientation of the D2 ATPase domain in p97 and a loss of its activity. Finally, we demonstrate that overproduction of ASPL disrupts p97 hexamer function in ERAD and that engineered eUBX polypeptides can induce cell death, providing a rationale for developing anti-cancer polypeptide inhibitors that may target p97 activity.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Arumughan","full_name":"Arumughan A","initials":"A"},{"last_name":"Roske","full_name":"Roske Y","initials":"Y"},{"last_name":"Barth","full_name":"Barth C","initials":"C"},{"last_name":"Forero","full_name":"Forero LL","initials":"LL"},{"last_name":"Bravo-Rodriguez","full_name":"Bravo-Rodriguez K","initials":"K"},{"last_name":"Redel","full_name":"Redel A","initials":"A"},{"last_name":"Kostova","full_name":"Kostova S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"McShane","full_name":"McShane E","initials":"E"},{"last_name":"Opitz","full_name":"Opitz R","initials":"R"},{"last_name":"Faelber","full_name":"Faelber K","initials":"K"},{"last_name":"Rau","full_name":"Rau K","initials":"K"},{"last_name":"Mielke","full_name":"Mielke T","initials":"T"},{"last_name":"Daumke","full_name":"Daumke O","initials":"O"},{"last_name":"Selbach","full_name":"Selbach M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Sanchez-Garcia","full_name":"Sanchez-Garcia E","initials":"E"},{"last_name":"Rocks","full_name":"Rocks O","initials":"O"},{"last_name":"Pan\u00e1kov\u00e1","full_name":"Pan\u00e1kov\u00e1 D","initials":"D"},{"last_name":"Heinemann","full_name":"Heinemann U","initials":"U"},{"last_name":"Wanker","full_name":"Wanker EE","initials":"EE"}],"pubmed_id":"27762274","type":"J"}]}
