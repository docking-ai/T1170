These transport activities are driven by the ATPase MacB, a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily. Here, we present the crystal structure of MacB at 3.4-\u00c5 resolution. MacB forms a dimer in which each protomer contains a nucleotide-binding domain and four transmembrane helices that protrude in the periplasm into a binding domain for interaction with the membrane fusion protein MacA. MacB represents an ABC transporter in pathogenic microorganisms with unique structural features.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Okada","full_name":"Okada U","initials":"U"},{"last_name":"Yamashita","full_name":"Yamashita E","initials":"E"},{"last_name":"Neuberger","full_name":"Neuberger A","initials":"A"},{"last_name":"Morimoto","full_name":"Morimoto M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"van Veen","full_name":"van Veen HW","initials":"HW"},{"last_name":"Murakami","full_name":"Murakami S","initials":"S"}],"title":"Crystal structure of tripartite-type ABC transporter MacB from Acinetobacter baumannii.","pubmed_id":"29109439","type":"J","associated_entries":"5ws4","doi":"10.1038/s41467-017-01399-2"}]}
