Excess or lack of zinc is detrimental, and cells exploit highly sensitive zinc-binding regulators to achieve homeostasis. In this article, we present a crystal structure of active Zur from Streptomyces coelicolor with three zinc-binding sites (C-, M-, and D-sites). Mutations of the three sites differentially affected sporulation and transcription of target genes, such that C- and M-site mutations inhibited sporulation and derepressed all target genes examined, whereas D-site mutations did not affect sporulation and derepressed only a sensitive gene. Biochemical and spectroscopic analyses of representative metal site mutants revealed that the C-site serves a structural role, whereas the M- and D-sites regulate DNA-binding activity as an on-off switch and a fine-tuner, respectively. Consistent with differential effect of mutations on target genes, zinc chelation by TPEN derepressed some genes (znuA, rpmF2) more sensitively than others (rpmG2, SCO7682) in vivo. Similar pattern of TPEN-sensitivity was observed for Zur-DNA complexes formed on different promoters in vitro. The sensitive promoters bound Zur with lower affinity than the less sensitive ones. EDTA-treated apo-Zur gained its DNA binding activity at different concentrations of added zinc for the two promoter groups, corresponding to free zinc concentrations of 4.5\u00d710(-16) M and 7.9\u00d710(-16) M for the less sensitive and sensitive promoters, respectively. The graded expression of target genes is a clever outcome of subtly modulating Zur-DNA binding affinities in response to zinc availability. It enables bacteria to detect metal depletion with improved sensitivity and optimize gene-expression pattern.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Shin","full_name":"Shin JH","initials":"JH"},{"last_name":"Jung","full_name":"Jung HJ","initials":"HJ"},{"last_name":"An","full_name":"An YJ","initials":"YJ"},{"last_name":"Cho","full_name":"Cho YB","initials":"YB"},{"last_name":"Cha","full_name":"Cha SS","initials":"SS"},{"last_name":"Roe","full_name":"Roe JH","initials":"JH"}],"title":"Graded expression of zinc-responsive genes through two regulatory zinc-binding sites in Zur.","pubmed_id":"21383173","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1073/pnas.1017744108"}]}
