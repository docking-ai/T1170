Here we report the structure of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae CMG, determined by cryo-EM at a resolution of 3.7-4.8 \u00c5. The structure reveals that GINS and Cdc45 scaffold the N tier of the helicase while enabling motion of the AAA+ C tier. CMG exists in two alternating conformations, compact and extended, thus suggesting that the helicase moves like an inchworm. The N-terminal regions of Mcm2-7, braced by Cdc45-GINS, form a rigid platform upon which the AAA+ C domains make longitudinal motions, nodding up and down like an oil-rig pumpjack attached to a stable platform. The Mcm ring is remodeled in CMG relative to the inactive Mcm2-7 double hexamer. The Mcm5 winged-helix domain is inserted into the central channel, thus blocking entry of double-stranded DNA and supporting a steric-exclusion DNA-unwinding model.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Yuan","full_name":"Yuan Z","initials":"Z"},{"last_name":"Bai","full_name":"Bai L","initials":"L"},{"last_name":"Sun","full_name":"Sun J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Georgescu","full_name":"Georgescu R","initials":"R"},{"last_name":"Liu","full_name":"Liu J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"O'Donnell","full_name":"O'Donnell ME","initials":"ME"},{"last_name":"Li","full_name":"Li H","initials":"H"}],"title":"Structure of the eukaryotic replicative CMG helicase suggests a pumpjack motion for translocation.","pubmed_id":"26854665","type":"J","associated_entries":"3jc5, 3jc6","doi":"10.1038/nsmb.3170"}]}
