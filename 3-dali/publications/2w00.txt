The first crystal structure of a type I motor subunit responsible for translocation and cleavage suggests how the pentameric translocating complex is assembled and provides a structural framework for translocation of duplex DNA by RecA-like ATPase motors.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Lapkouski","full_name":"Lapkouski M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Panjikar","full_name":"Panjikar S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Janscak","full_name":"Janscak P","initials":"P"},{"last_name":"Smatanova","full_name":"Smatanova IK","initials":"IK"},{"last_name":"Carey","full_name":"Carey J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Ettrich","full_name":"Ettrich R","initials":"R"},{"last_name":"Csefalvay","full_name":"Csefalvay E","initials":"E"}],"title":"Structure of the motor subunit of type I restriction-modification complex EcoR124I.","pubmed_id":"19079266","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1038/nsmb.1523"}]}
