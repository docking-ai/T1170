Here, we address the elusive link between these phenomena by employing cryo-electron tomography to dissect the molecular architecture of protein aggregates within intact neurons at high resolution. We focus on the poly-Gly-Ala (poly-GA) aggregates resulting from aberrant translation of an expanded GGGGCC repeat in C9orf72, the most common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia. We find that poly-GA aggregates consist of densely packed twisted ribbons that recruit numerous 26S proteasome complexes, while other macromolecules are largely excluded. Proximity to poly-GA ribbons stabilizes a transient substrate-processing conformation of the 26S proteasome, suggesting stalled degradation. Thus, poly-GA aggregates may compromise neuronal proteostasis by driving the accumulation and functional impairment of a large fraction of cellular proteasomes.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Guo","full_name":"Guo Q","initials":"Q"},{"last_name":"Lehmer","full_name":"Lehmer C","initials":"C"},{"last_name":"Mart\u00ednez-S\u00e1nchez","full_name":"Mart\u00ednez-S\u00e1nchez A","initials":"A"},{"last_name":"Rudack","full_name":"Rudack T","initials":"T"},{"last_name":"Beck","full_name":"Beck F","initials":"F"},{"last_name":"Hartmann","full_name":"Hartmann H","initials":"H"},{"last_name":"P\u00e9rez-Berlanga","full_name":"P\u00e9rez-Berlanga M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Frottin","full_name":"Frottin F","initials":"F"},{"last_name":"Hipp","full_name":"Hipp MS","initials":"MS"},{"last_name":"Hartl","full_name":"Hartl FU","initials":"FU"},{"last_name":"Edbauer","full_name":"Edbauer D","initials":"D"},{"last_name":"Baumeister","full_name":"Baumeister W","initials":"W"},{"last_name":"Fern\u00e1ndez-Busnadiego","full_name":"Fern\u00e1ndez-Busnadiego R","initials":"R"}],"title":"In Situ Structure of Neuronal C9orf72 Poly-GA Aggregates Reveals Proteasome Recruitment.","pubmed_id":"29398115","type":"J","associated_entries":"6epd, 6epe, 6epf","doi":"10.1016/j.cell.2017.12.030"}]}
