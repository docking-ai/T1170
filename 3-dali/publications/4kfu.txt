One such reaction is the encapsidation of the dsDNA genome of an icosahedrally-symmetric virus into a preformed procapsid with the help of a genome translocating NTPase. Such NTPases have been characterized in detail from both RNA and tailed DNA viruses. We present four crystal structures and the biochemical activity of a thermophilic NTPase, B204, from the non-tailed, membrane-containing, hyperthermo-acidophilic archaeal dsDNA virus Sulfolobus turreted icosahedral virus 2. These are the first structures of a genome packaging NTPase from a non-tailed, dsDNA virus with an archaeal host. The four structures highlight the catalytic cycle of B204, pinpointing the molecular movement between substrate-bound (open) and empty (closed) active sites. The protein is shown to bind both single-stranded and double-stranded nucleic acids, and to have an optimum activity at 80\u00b0C and pH 4.5. The overall fold of B204 places it in the FtsK-HerA superfamily of P-loop ATPases, whose cellular and viral members have been suggested to share a common DNA-translocating mechanism.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Happonen","full_name":"Happonen LJ","initials":"LJ"},{"last_name":"Oksanen","full_name":"Oksanen E","initials":"E"},{"last_name":"Liljeroos","full_name":"Liljeroos L","initials":"L"},{"last_name":"Goldman","full_name":"Goldman A","initials":"A"},{"last_name":"Kajander","full_name":"Kajander T","initials":"T"},{"last_name":"Butcher","full_name":"Butcher SJ","initials":"SJ"}],"title":"The structure of the NTPase that powers DNA packaging into Sulfolobus turreted icosahedral virus 2.","pubmed_id":"23698307","type":"J","associated_entries":"4kfr, 4kfs, 4kft","doi":"10.1128/JVI.00831-13"}]}
