IBMPFD mutants have single amino-acid substitutions at the interface between the N-terminal domain (N-domain) and the adjacent AAA domain (D1), resulting in a reduced affinity for ADP. The structures of p97 N-D1 fragments bearing IBMPFD mutations adopt an atypical N-domain conformation in the presence of Mg(2+).ATPgammaS, which is reversible by ADP, showing for the first time the nucleotide-dependent conformational change of the N-domain. The transition from the ADP- to the ATPgammaS-bound state is accompanied by a loop-to-helix conversion in the N-D1 linker and by an apparent re-ordering in the N-terminal region of p97. X-ray scattering experiments suggest that wild-type p97 subunits undergo a similar nucleotide-dependent N-domain conformational change. We propose that IBMPFD mutations alter the timing of the transition between nucleotide states by destabilizing the ADP-bound form and consequently interfere with the interactions between the N-domains and their substrates.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Tang","full_name":"Tang WK","initials":"WK"},{"last_name":"Li","full_name":"Li D","initials":"D"},{"last_name":"Li","full_name":"Li CC","initials":"CC"},{"last_name":"Esser","full_name":"Esser L","initials":"L"},{"last_name":"Dai","full_name":"Dai R","initials":"R"},{"last_name":"Guo","full_name":"Guo L","initials":"L"},{"last_name":"Xia","full_name":"Xia D","initials":"D"}],"title":"A novel ATP-dependent conformation in p97 N-D1 fragment revealed by crystal structures of disease-related mutants.","pubmed_id":"20512113","type":"J","associated_entries":"3hu1, 3hu3","doi":"10.1038/emboj.2010.104"}]}
