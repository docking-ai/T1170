The function of AAA+ chaperones is mostly modulated by their hexameric/dodecameric quaternary structures. Here we report the structural and biochemical characterizations of a tetradecameric AAA+\u00a0chaperone, ClpL from Streptococcus pneumoniae. ClpL exists as a tetradecamer in solution in the presence of ATP. The cryo-EM structure of ClpL at 4.5\u00a0\u00c5 resolution reveals a striking tetradecameric arrangement. Solution structures of ClpL derived from small-angle X-ray scattering data suggest that the tetradecameric ClpL could assume a spiral conformation found in active hexameric/dodecameric AAA+\u00a0chaperone structures. Vertical positioning of the middle domain accounts for the head-to-head arrangement of two heptameric rings. Biochemical activity assays with site-directed mutagenesis confirmed the critical roles of residues both in the integrity of the tetradecameric arrangement and activities of ClpL. Non-conserved Q321 and R670 are crucial in the heptameric ring assembly of ClpL. These results establish that ClpL is a functionally active tetradecamer, clearly distinct from hexameric/dodecameric AAA+\u00a0chaperones.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Kim","full_name":"Kim G","initials":"G"},{"last_name":"Lee","full_name":"Lee SG","initials":"SG"},{"last_name":"Han","full_name":"Han S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Jung","full_name":"Jung J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Jeong","full_name":"Jeong HS","initials":"HS"},{"last_name":"Hyun","full_name":"Hyun JK","initials":"JK"},{"last_name":"Rhee","full_name":"Rhee DK","initials":"DK"},{"last_name":"Kim","full_name":"Kim HM","initials":"HM"},{"last_name":"Lee","full_name":"Lee S","initials":"S"}],"title":"ClpL is a functionally active tetradecameric AAA+ chaperone, distinct from hexameric/dodecameric ones.","pubmed_id":"32910525","type":"J","associated_entries":"6lsy","doi":"10.1096/fj.202000843R"}]}
