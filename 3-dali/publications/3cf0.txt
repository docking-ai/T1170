We determined the crystal structure of D2 at 3.0 A resolution. This model enabled rerefinement of full-length p97 in different nucleotide states against previously reported low-resolution diffraction data to significantly improved R values and Ramachandran statistics. Although the overall fold remained similar, there are significant improvements, especially around the D2 nucleotide binding site. The rerefinement illustrates the importance of knowledge of high-resolution structures of fragments covering most of the whole molecule. The structures suggest that nucleotide hydrolysis is transformed into larger conformational changes by pushing of one D2 domain by its neighbor in the hexamer, and transmission of nucleotide-state information through the D1-D2 linker to displace the N-terminal, effector binding domain.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Davies","full_name":"Davies JM","initials":"JM"},{"last_name":"Brunger","full_name":"Brunger AT","initials":"AT"},{"last_name":"Weis","full_name":"Weis WI","initials":"WI"}],"title":"Improved structures of full-length p97, an AAA ATPase: implications for mechanisms of nucleotide-dependent conformational change.","pubmed_id":"18462676","type":"J","associated_entries":"3cf1, 3cf2, 3cf3","doi":"10.1016/j.str.2008.02.010"}]}
