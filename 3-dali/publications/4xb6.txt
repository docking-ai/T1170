When phosphate is in limited supply, some bacteria are able to use phosphonate compounds, which require specialized enzymatic machinery to break the stable carbon-phosphorus (C-P) bond. Despite its importance, the details of how this machinery catabolizes phosphonates remain unknown. Here we determine the crystal structure of the 240-kilodalton Escherichia coli C-P lyase core complex (PhnG-PhnH-PhnI-PhnJ; PhnGHIJ), and show that it is a two-fold symmetric hetero-octamer comprising an intertwined network of subunits with unexpected self-homologies. It contains two potential active sites that probably couple phosphonate compounds to ATP and subsequently hydrolyse the C-P bond. We map the binding site of PhnK on the complex using electron microscopy, and show that it binds to a conserved insertion domain of PhnJ. Our results provide a structural basis for understanding microbial phosphonate breakdown.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Seweryn","full_name":"Seweryn P","initials":"P"},{"last_name":"Van","full_name":"Van LB","initials":"LB"},{"last_name":"Kjeldgaard","full_name":"Kjeldgaard M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Russo","full_name":"Russo CJ","initials":"CJ"},{"last_name":"Passmore","full_name":"Passmore LA","initials":"LA"},{"last_name":"Hove-Jensen","full_name":"Hove-Jensen B","initials":"B"},{"last_name":"Jochimsen","full_name":"Jochimsen B","initials":"B"},{"last_name":"Brodersen","full_name":"Brodersen DE","initials":"DE"}],"title":"Structural insights into the bacterial carbon-phosphorus lyase machinery.","pubmed_id":"26280334","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1038/nature14683"}]}
