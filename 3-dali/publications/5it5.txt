The PilB/GspE family ATPases power the assembly of T4P and type 2 secretion systems. We determined the structure of the ATPase region of PilB (PilBATP) in complex with ATP\u03b3S to provide a model of a T4P assembly ATPase and a view of a PilB/GspE family hexamer at better than 3-\u00c5 resolution. Spatial positioning and conformations of the protomers suggest a mechanism of force generation. All six PilBATP protomers contain bound ATP\u03b3S. Two protomers form a closed conformation poised for ATP hydrolysis. The other four molecules assume an open conformation but separate into two pairs with distinct active-site accessibilities. We propose that one pair represents the post-hydrolysis phase while the other pair appears poised for ADP/ATP exchange. Collectively, the data suggest that T4P assembly is powered by coordinating concurrent substrate binding with ATP hydrolysis across the PilB hexamer.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Mancl","full_name":"Mancl JM","initials":"JM"},{"last_name":"Black","full_name":"Black WP","initials":"WP"},{"last_name":"Robinson","full_name":"Robinson H","initials":"H"},{"last_name":"Yang","full_name":"Yang Z","initials":"Z"},{"last_name":"Schubot","full_name":"Schubot FD","initials":"FD"}],"pubmed_id":"27667690","type":"J"}]}
