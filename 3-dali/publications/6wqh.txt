To understand the structural basis for the substrate translocation process, we determined the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of Meiothermus taiwanensis LonA (MtaLonA) in a substrate-engaged state at 3.6\u00a0\u00c5 resolution. Our data indicate that substrate interactions are mediated by the dual pore loops of the ATPase domains, organized in spiral staircase arrangement from four consecutive protomers in different ATP-binding and hydrolysis states. However, a closed AAA+ ring is maintained by two disengaged ADP-bound protomers transiting between the lowest and highest position. This structure reveals a processive rotary translocation mechanism mediated by LonA-specific nucleotide-dependent allosteric coordination among the ATPase domains, which is induced by substrate binding.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Li","full_name":"Li S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Hsieh","full_name":"Hsieh KY","initials":"KY"},{"last_name":"Su","full_name":"Su SC","initials":"SC"},{"last_name":"Pintilie","full_name":"Pintilie GD","initials":"GD"},{"last_name":"Zhang","full_name":"Zhang K","initials":"K"},{"last_name":"Chang","full_name":"Chang CI","initials":"CI"}],"title":"Molecular basis for ATPase-powered substrate translocation by the Lon AAA+ protease.","pubmed_id":"34563541","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1016/j.jbc.2021.101239"}]}
