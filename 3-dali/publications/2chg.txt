Mutation of the proposed arginine finger in the small subunits results in a complex that can still bind ATP but has impaired clamp-loading activity, a process that normally only requires binding of nucleotide. The small subunit alone forms a hexameric ring that is six-fold symmetric in the absence of ATP. However, this symmetry is broken when the nucleotide is bound to the complex. A conformational change associated with nucleotide binding may relate to the opening of PCNA rings by RFC during the loading reaction. The structures also reveal the importance of the N-terminal helix of each subunit at the ATP-binding site. Analysis of mutant protein complexes containing subunits lacking this N-terminal helix reveals key distinct regulatory roles during clamp loading that are different for the large and small subunits in the RFC complex.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Seybert","full_name":"Seybert A","initials":"A"},{"last_name":"Singleton","full_name":"Singleton MR","initials":"MR"},{"last_name":"Cook","full_name":"Cook N","initials":"N"},{"last_name":"Hall","full_name":"Hall DR","initials":"DR"},{"last_name":"Wigley","full_name":"Wigley DB","initials":"DB"}],"title":"Communication between subunits within an archaeal clamp-loader complex.","pubmed_id":"16628222","type":"J","associated_entries":"2chq, 2chv","doi":"10.1038/sj.emboj.7601093"}]}
