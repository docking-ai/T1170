In the archaea Methanocaldococcus jannaschii, the RP is a homohexameric complex of proteasome-activating nucleotidase (PAN). Here, we report the crystal structures of essential elements of the archaeal proteasome: the CP, the ATPase domain of PAN, and a distal subcomplex that is likely the first to encounter substrate. The distal subcomplex contains a coiled-coil segment and an OB-fold domain, both of which appear to be conserved in the eukaryotic proteasome. The OB domains of PAN form a hexameric ring with a 13 A pore, which likely constitutes the outermost constriction of the substrate translocation channel. These studies reveal structural codes and architecture of the complete proteasome, identify potential substrate-binding sites, and uncover unexpected asymmetry in the RP of archaea and eukaryotes.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Zhang","full_name":"Zhang F","initials":"F"},{"last_name":"Hu","full_name":"Hu M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Tian","full_name":"Tian G","initials":"G"},{"last_name":"Zhang","full_name":"Zhang P","initials":"P"},{"last_name":"Finley","full_name":"Finley D","initials":"D"},{"last_name":"Jeffrey","full_name":"Jeffrey PD","initials":"PD"},{"last_name":"Shi","full_name":"Shi Y","initials":"Y"}],"title":"Structural insights into the regulatory particle of the proteasome from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii.","pubmed_id":"19481527","type":"J","associated_entries":"3h43, 3h4p","doi":"10.1016/j.molcel.2009.04.021"}]}
