These pre-60S particles mature by transiently interacting with various assembly factors. The ~5000 amino-acid AAA+ ATPase Rea1 (or Midasin) generates force to mechanically remove assembly factors from pre-60S particles, which promotes their export to the cytosol. Here we present three Rea1 cryoEM structures. We visualize the Rea1 engine, a hexameric ring of AAA+ domains, and identify an \u03b1-helical bundle of AAA2 as a major ATPase activity regulator. The \u03b1-helical bundle interferes with nucleotide induced conformational changes that create a docking site for the substrate binding MIDAS domain on the AAA+ ring. Furthermore, we reveal the architecture of the Rea1 linker, which is involved in force generation and extends from the AAA+ ring. The data presented here provide insights into the mechanism of one of the most complex ribosome maturation factors.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Sosnowski","full_name":"Sosnowski P","initials":"P"},{"last_name":"Urnavicius","full_name":"Urnavicius L","initials":"L"},{"last_name":"Boland","full_name":"Boland A","initials":"A"},{"last_name":"Fagiewicz","full_name":"Fagiewicz R","initials":"R"},{"last_name":"Busselez","full_name":"Busselez J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Papai","full_name":"Papai G","initials":"G"},{"last_name":"Schmidt","full_name":"Schmidt H","initials":"H"}],"title":"The CryoEM structure of the <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> ribosome maturation factor Rea1.","pubmed_id":"30460895","type":"J","associated_entries":"6hyd, 6i26, 6i27","doi":"10.7554/eLife.39163"}]}
