We also found that the transcription of pobA is induced by PHB and is negatively regulated by the product of SCO3209, which we named PobR. The product of this gene is highly unusual in that it is the apparent fusion of two IclR family transcription factors. Bioinformatic analyses, in vivo transcriptional assays, electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs), DNase I footprinting, and isothermal calorimetry (ITC) were used to elucidate the regulatory mechanism of PobR. We found that PobR loses its high affinity for DNA (i.e., the pobA operator) in the presence of PHB, the inducer of pobA transcription. PHB binds to PobR with a KD of 5.8 \u03bcM. Size-exclusion chromatography revealed that PobR is a dimer in the absence of PHB and a monomer in the presence of PHB. The crystal structure of PobR in complex with PHB showed that only one of the two IclR ligand binding domains was occupied, and defined how the N-terminal ligand binding domain engages the effector ligand.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Zhang","full_name":"Zhang R","initials":"R"},{"last_name":"Lord","full_name":"Lord DM","initials":"DM"},{"last_name":"Bajaj","full_name":"Bajaj R","initials":"R"},{"last_name":"Peti","full_name":"Peti W","initials":"W"},{"last_name":"Page","full_name":"Page R","initials":"R"},{"last_name":"Sello","full_name":"Sello JK","initials":"JK"}],"title":"A peculiar IclR family transcription factor regulates para-hydroxybenzoate catabolism in Streptomyces coelicolor.","pubmed_id":"29240934","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1093/nar/gkx1234"}]}
