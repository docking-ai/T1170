The protein crystallizes in space group P2(1)2(1)2(1), with unit-cell parameters a = 43.53, b = 121.30, c = 143.75 A. Native data to a resolution of 2.25 A were recorded at station PX 14.1 (Daresbury) from a single crystal. Preliminary analysis of these data suggests that the asymmetric unit contains four copies of the AbsC monomer, giving an estimated solvent content of 47.0%. AbsC belongs to the MarR family of proteins that mediate ligand-responsive transcriptional control.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Stevenson","full_name":"Stevenson CE","initials":"CE"},{"last_name":"Kock","full_name":"Kock H","initials":"H"},{"last_name":"Mootien","full_name":"Mootien S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Davies","full_name":"Davies SC","initials":"SC"},{"last_name":"Bibb","full_name":"Bibb MJ","initials":"MJ"},{"last_name":"Lawson","full_name":"Lawson DM","initials":"DM"}],"title":"Crystallization and preliminary X-ray analysis of AbsC, a novel regulator of antibiotic production in Streptomyces coelicolor.","pubmed_id":"17329821","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1107/S1744309107007944"}]}
