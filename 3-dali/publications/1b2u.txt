Each mutant deletes a different type of interaction at the interface: the first complex bnHis102-->Ala-bsTyr29-->Phe (bn, barnase; bs, barstar), deletes a van der Waals packing interaction; the second complex, bnLys27-->Ala-bsThr42-->Ala, deletes a hydrogen bond; the third, bnLys27-->Ala-bsAsp35-->Ala, deletes a long-range charge-charge interaction. The contribution of each of these side-chains to the stability of the complex is known; the coupling energy between the deleted side-chains is also known. Despite each of the double mutants being significantly destabilised compared with the wild-type, the effects of mutation are local. Only small movements in the main-chain surrounding the sites of mutation and some larger movements of neighbouring side-chains are observed in the mutant complexes. The exact response to mutation is context-dependent and for the same mutant can vary depending upon the environment within the crystal. In some double mutant complexes, interfacial pockets, which are accessible to bulk solvent are formed, whereas interfacial cavities which are isolated from bulk solvent, are formed in others. In all double mutants, water molecules fill the created pockets and cavities. These water molecules mimic the deleted side-chains by occupying positions close to the non-carbon atoms of truncated side-chains and re-making many hydrogen bonds made by the truncated side-chains in the wild-type. It remains extremely difficult, however, to correlate energetic and structural responses to mutation because of unknown changes in entropy and entropy-enthalpy compensation.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Vaughan","full_name":"Vaughan CK","initials":"CK"},{"last_name":"Buckle","full_name":"Buckle AM","initials":"AM"},{"last_name":"Fersht","full_name":"Fersht AR","initials":"AR"}],"title":"Structural response to mutation at a protein-protein interface.","pubmed_id":"10064711","type":"J","associated_entries":"1b27, 1b2s, 1b3s, 1bgs, 1brs","doi":"10.1006/jmbi.1998.2559"},{"journal_info":{"volume":"33","pdb_abbreviation":"Biochemistry","ISO_abbreviation":"Biochemistry","year":1994,"issue":"30","pages":"8878-89"},"abstract":{"methods":null,"conclusions":null,"results":null,"unassigned":"We have solved, refined, and analyzed the 2.0-\u00e5 resolution crystal structure of a 1:1 complex between the bacterial ribonuclease, barnase, and a Cys-->Ala(40,82) double mutant of its intracellular polypeptide inhibitor, barstar. Barstar inhibits barnase by sterically blocking the active site with a helix and adjacent loop segment. Almost half of the 14 hydrogen bonds between barnase and barstar involve two charged residues, and a third involve one charged partner. The electrostatic contribution to the overall binding energy is considerably greater than for other protein-protein interactions. Consequently, the very high rate constant for the barnase-barstar association (10(8) s-1 M-1) is most likely due to electrostatic steering effects. The barnase active-site residue His102 is located in a pocket on the surface of barstar, and its hydrogen bonds with Asp39 and Gly31 residues of barstar are directly responsible for the pH dependence of barnase-barstar binding. There is a high degree of complementarity both of the shape and of the charge of the interacting surfaces, but neither is perfect. The surface complementarity is slightly poorer than in protease-inhibitor complexes but a little better than in antibody-antigen interactions. However, since the burial of solvent in the barnase-barstar interface improves the fit significantly by filling in the majority of gaps, as well as stabilizing unfavorable electrostatic interactions, its role seems to be more important than in other protein-protein complexes. The electrostatic interactions between barnase and barstar are very similar to those between barnase and the tetranucleotide d(CGAC). In the barnase-barstar complex, the two phosphate-binding sites in the barnase active site are occupied by Asp39 and Gly43 of barstar. However, barstar has no equivalent for a guanine base of an RNA substrate, resulting in the occupation of the guanine recognition site in the barnase-barstar complex by nine ordered water molecules. Upon barnase-barstar binding, entropy losses resulting from the immobilization of segments of the protein chain and the energetic costs of conformational changes are minimized due to the essentially preformed active site of barnase. However, a certain degree of flexibility within the barnase active site is required to allow for the structural differences between barnase-barstar binding and barnase-RNA binding. A comparison between the bound and the free barstar structure shows that the overall structural response to barnase-binding is significant. This response can be best described as outwardly oriented, rigid-body movements of the four alpha-helices of barstar, resulting in the structure of bound barstar being somewhat expanded.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Buckle","full_name":"Buckle AM","initials":"AM"},{"last_name":"Schreiber","full_name":"Schreiber G","initials":"G"},{"last_name":"Fersht","full_name":"Fersht AR","initials":"AR"}],"title":"Protein-protein recognition: crystal structural analysis of a barnase-barstar complex at 2.0-A resolution.","pubmed_id":"8043575","type":"J","associated_entries":"1b27, 1b2s, 1b3s, 1bgs, 1brs","doi":"10.1021/bi00196a004"},{"journal_info":{"volume":"2","pdb_abbreviation":"Structure","ISO_abbreviation":"Structure","year":1994,"issue":"10","pages":"945-51"},"abstract":{"methods":null,"conclusions":"The evolutionary pressure on barstar for rapid binding of barnase is so strong that glutamate is preferred over alanine at position 80, even though it does not directly interact with barnase in the complex and significantly destabilizes the inhibitor structure.

At pH 8, the values for the rate constants k1 (association) and k-1 (dissociation) are 6.0 x 10(8) s-1 M-1 and 8.0 x 10(-6) s-1, respectively. The value of Ki, the dissociation constant of barstar and barnase, calculated from the ratio k-1/k1 is 1.3 x 10(-14) M, which corresponds to a delta G of -18.9 kcal/mol at 25 degrees C. The dissociation constant increases with decreasing pH according to the ionization of an acid in free barnase of pKa 6.4, with very weak, if any, binding to the protonated form. This pH dependence for dissociation of the complex can be attributed almost entirely to residue His102 in barnase, as determined by a His102-->Ala mutation. Analysis of the pH dependence of the kinetic constants indicates that binding is, at least, a two-step process. The first, and rate-determining, step is association at close to the diffusion-controlled rate. There is then the precise docking of the complex. The value of Ki increases to 2.4 x 10(-11) M in the presence of 500 mM NaCl, and to 1.6 x 10(-11) M at pH 5 (100 mM NaCl).
