Relatively little is known about the stoichiometry, structure and assembly pathway of this complex, and how it interacts with the replicative helicase, in Gram-positive organisms. Analysis of full and partial complexes by mass spectrometry revealed that a hetero-pentameric \u03c43-\u03b4-\u03b4' Bacillus subtilis clamp-loader assembles via multiple pathways, which differ from those exhibited by the Gram-negative model Escherichia coli. Based on this information, a homology model of the B. subtilis \u03c43-\u03b4-\u03b4' complex was constructed, which revealed the spatial positioning of the full C-terminal \u03c4 domain. The structure of the \u03b4 subunit was determined by X-ray crystallography and shown to differ from that of E. coli in the nature of the amino acids comprising the \u03c4 and \u03b4' binding regions. Most notably, the \u03c4-\u03b4 interaction appears to be hydrophilic in nature compared with the hydrophobic interaction in E. coli. Finally, the interaction between \u03c43 and the replicative helicase DnaB was driven by ATP/Mg(2+) conformational changes in DnaB, and evidence is provided that hydrolysis of one ATP molecule by the DnaB hexamer is sufficient to stabilize its interaction with \u03c43.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Afonso","full_name":"Afonso JP","initials":"JP"},{"last_name":"Chintakayala","full_name":"Chintakayala K","initials":"K"},{"last_name":"Suwannachart","full_name":"Suwannachart C","initials":"C"},{"last_name":"Sedelnikova","full_name":"Sedelnikova S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Giles","full_name":"Giles K","initials":"K"},{"last_name":"Hoyes","full_name":"Hoyes JB","initials":"JB"},{"last_name":"Soultanas","full_name":"Soultanas P","initials":"P"},{"last_name":"Rafferty","full_name":"Rafferty JB","initials":"JB"},{"last_name":"Oldham","full_name":"Oldham NJ","initials":"NJ"}],"pubmed_id":"23525462","type":"J"}]}
