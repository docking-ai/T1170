Here we report the cryo-EM structure of a divergent ATP synthase dimer from mitochondria of <i>Euglena gracilis</i>, a member of the phylum Euglenozoa that also includes human parasites. It features 29 different subunits, 8 of which are newly identified. The membrane region was determined to 2.8 \u00c5 resolution, enabling the identification of 37 associated lipids, including 25 cardiolipins, which provides insight into protein-lipid interaction and their functional roles. The rotor-stator interface comprises four membrane-embedded horizontal helices, including a distinct subunit <i>a</i>. The dimer interface is formed entirely by phylum-specific components, and a peripherally associated subcomplex contributes to the membrane curvature. The central and peripheral stalks directly interact with each other. Last, the ATPase inhibitory factor 1 (IF<sub>1</sub>) binds in a mode that is different from human, but conserved in Trypanosomatids.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"M\u00fchleip","full_name":"M\u00fchleip A","initials":"A"},{"last_name":"McComas","full_name":"McComas SE","initials":"SE"},{"last_name":"Amunts","full_name":"Amunts A","initials":"A"}],"pubmed_id":"31738165","type":"J"}]}
