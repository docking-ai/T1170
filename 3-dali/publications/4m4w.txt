Here, to provide a better understanding of this key process, we report the crystal structure of the ~570-kDa prepriming complex between the Bacillus subtilis loader protein and the Bacillus stearothermophilus helicase, as well as the helicase-binding domain of primase with a molar ratio of 6:6:3 at 7.5\u2009\u00c5 resolution. The overall architecture of the complex exhibits a three-layered ring conformation. Moreover, the structure combined with the proposed model suggests that the shift from the 'open-ring' to the 'open-spiral' and then the 'closed-spiral' state of the helicase ring due to the binding of single-stranded DNA may be the cause of the loader release.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Liu","full_name":"Liu B","initials":"B"},{"last_name":"Eliason","full_name":"Eliason WK","initials":"WK"},{"last_name":"Steitz","full_name":"Steitz TA","initials":"TA"}],"title":"Structure of a helicase-helicase loader complex reveals insights into the mechanism of bacterial primosome assembly.","pubmed_id":"24048025","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1038/ncomms3495"}]}
