Unattached kinetochores convert the latent open conformer of the checkpoint protein Mad2 (O-Mad2) to the active closed conformer (C-Mad2),\u00a0bound to Cdc20. C-Mad2-Cdc20 is incorporated into the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC), which inhibits the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C). The C-Mad2-binding protein p31<sub>comet</sub> and the ATPase TRIP13 promote MCC disassembly and checkpoint silencing. Here, using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, we show that TRIP13 and p31<sub>comet</sub> catalyze the conversion of C-Mad2 to O-Mad2, without disrupting its stably folded core. We determine the crystal structure of human TRIP13, and identify functional TRIP13 residues that mediate p31<sub>comet</sub>-Mad2 binding and couple ATP hydrolysis to local unfolding of Mad2. TRIP13 and p31<sub>comet</sub> prevent APC/C inhibition by MCC components, but cannot reactivate APC/C already bound to MCC. Therefore, TRIP13-p31<sub>comet</sub> intercepts and disassembles free MCC not bound to APC/C through mediating the local unfolding of the Mad2 C-terminal region.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Brulotte","full_name":"Brulotte ML","initials":"ML"},{"last_name":"Jeong","full_name":"Jeong BC","initials":"BC"},{"last_name":"Li","full_name":"Li F","initials":"F"},{"last_name":"Li","full_name":"Li B","initials":"B"},{"last_name":"Yu","full_name":"Yu EB","initials":"EB"},{"last_name":"Wu","full_name":"Wu Q","initials":"Q"},{"last_name":"Brautigam","full_name":"Brautigam CA","initials":"CA"},{"last_name":"Yu","full_name":"Yu H","initials":"H"},{"last_name":"Luo","full_name":"Luo X","initials":"X"}],"title":"Mechanistic insight into TRIP13-catalyzed Mad2 structural transition and spindle checkpoint silencing.","pubmed_id":"29208896","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1038/s41467-017-02012-2"}]}
