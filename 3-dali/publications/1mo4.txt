Central to all activities of RecA is its binding to Mg(+2)-ATP. The active form of the protein is a helical nucleoprotein filament containing the nucleotide cofactor and single-stranded DNA. The stability and structure of the helical nucleoprotein filament formed by RecA are modulated by nucleotide cofactors. Here we report crystal structures of a MtRecA-ADP complex, complexes with ATPgammaS in the presence and absence of magnesium as well as a complex with dATP and Mg+2. Comparison with the recently solved crystal structures of the apo form as well as a complex with ADP-AlF4 confirms an expansion of the P-loop region in MtRecA, compared to its homologue in Escherichia coli, correlating with the reduced affinity of MtRecA for ATP. The ligand bound structures reveal subtle variations in nucleotide conformations among different nucleotides that serve in maintaining the network of interactions crucial for nucleotide binding. The nucleotide binding site itself, however, remains relatively unchanged. The analysis also reveals that ATPgammaS rather than ADP-AlF4 is structurally a better mimic of ATP. From among the complexed structures, a definition for the two DNA-binding loops L1 and L2 has clearly emerged for the first time and provides a basis to understand DNA binding by RecA. The structural information obtained from these complexes correlates well with the extensive biochemical data on mutants available in the literature, contributing to an understanding of the role of individual residues in the nucleotide binding pocket, at the molecular level. Modeling studies on the mutants again point to the relative rigidity of the nucleotide binding site. Comparison with other NTP binding proteins reveals many commonalties in modes of binding by diverse members in the structural family, contributing to our understanding of the structural signature of NTP recognition.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Datta","full_name":"Datta S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Ganesh","full_name":"Ganesh N","initials":"N"},{"last_name":"Chandra","full_name":"Chandra NR","initials":"NR"},{"last_name":"Muniyappa","full_name":"Muniyappa K","initials":"K"},{"last_name":"Vijayan","full_name":"Vijayan M","initials":"M"}],"title":"Structural studies on MtRecA-nucleotide complexes: insights into DNA and nucleotide binding and the structural signature of NTP recognition.","pubmed_id":"12557189","type":"J","associated_entries":"1g18, 1g19, 1mo3, 1mo5, 1mo6","doi":"10.1002/prot.10315"},{"journal_info":{"volume":"28","pdb_abbreviation":"Nucleic Acids Res.","ISO_abbreviation":"Nucleic Acids Res.","year":2000,"issue":"24","pages":"4964-73"},"abstract":{"methods":null,"conclusions":null,"results":null,"unassigned":"Sequencing of the complete genome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, combined with the rapidly increasing need to improve tuberculosis management through better drugs and vaccines, has initiated extensive research on several key proteins from the pathogen. RecA, a ubiquitous multifunctional protein, is a key component of the processes of homologous genetic recombination and DNA repair. Structural knowledge of MtRecA is imperative for a full understanding of both these activities and any ensuing application. The crystal structure of MtRecA, presented here, has six molecules in the unit cell forming a 6(1) helical filament with a deep groove capable of binding DNA. The observed weakening in the higher order aggregation of filaments into bundles may have implications for recombination in mycobacteria. The structure of the complex reveals the atomic interactions of ADP-AlF(4), an ATP analogue, with the P-loop-containing binding pocket. The structures explain reduced levels of interactions of MtRecA with ATP, despite sharing the same fold, topology and high sequence similarity with EcRecA. The formation of a helical filament with a deep groove appears to be an inherent property of MtRecA. The histidine in loop L1 appears to be positioned appropriately for DNA interaction.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Datta","full_name":"Datta S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Prabu","full_name":"Prabu MM","initials":"MM"},{"last_name":"Vaze","full_name":"Vaze MB","initials":"MB"},{"last_name":"Ganesh","full_name":"Ganesh N","initials":"N"},{"last_name":"Chandra","full_name":"Chandra NR","initials":"NR"},{"last_name":"Muniyappa","full_name":"Muniyappa K","initials":"K"},{"last_name":"Vijayan","full_name":"Vijayan M","initials":"M"}],"title":"Crystal structures of Mycobacterium tuberculosis RecA and its complex with ADP-AlF(4): implications for decreased ATPase activity and molecular aggregation.","pubmed_id":"11121488","type":"J","associated_entries":"1g18, 1g19, 1mo3, 1mo5, 1mo6","doi":"10.1093/nar/28.24.4964"},{"journal_info":{"volume":"35","pdb_abbreviation":"Biochemistry","ISO_abbreviation":"Biochemistry","year":1996,"issue":"6","pages":"1793-802"},"abstract":{"methods":null,"conclusions":null,"results":null,"unassigned":"The recA locus of pathogenic mycobacteria differs from that of nonpathogenic species because it contains large intervening sequences nested in the RecA homology region that are excised by an unusual protein-splicing reaction. In vivo assays indicated that Mycobacterium tuberculosis recA partially complemented Escherichia coli recA mutants for recombination and mutagenesis. Further, splicing of the 85 kDa precursor to 38 kDa MtRecA protein was necessary for the display of its activity, in vivo. To gain insights into the molecular basis for partial and lack of complementation by MtRecA and 85 kDa proteins, respectively, we purified both of them to homogeneity. MtRecA protein, but not the 85 kDa form, bound stoichiometrically to single-stranded DNA in the presence of ATP. MtRecA protein was cross-linked to 8-azidoadenosine 5'-triphosphate with reduced efficiency, and kinetic analysis of ATPase activity suggested that it is due to decreased affinity for ATP. In contrast, the 85 kDa form was unable to bind ATP, in the presence or absence of ssDNA and, consequently, was entirely devoid of ATPase activity. Molecular modeling studies suggested that the decreased affinity of MtRecA protein for ATP and the reduced efficiency of its hydrolysis might be due to the widening of the cleft which alters the hydrogen bonds and the contact area between the enzyme and the substrate and changes in the disposition of the amino acid residues around the magnesium ion and the gamma-phosphate. The formation of joint molecules promoted by MtRecA protein was stimulated by SSB when the former was added first. The probability of an association between the lack and partial levels of biological activity of RecA protein(s) to that of illegitimate recombination in pathogenic mycobacteria is considered.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Kumar","full_name":"Kumar RA","initials":"RA"},{"last_name":"Vaze","full_name":"Vaze MB","initials":"MB"},{"last_name":"Chandra","full_name":"Chandra NR","initials":"NR"},{"last_name":"Vijayan","full_name":"Vijayan M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Muniyappa","full_name":"Muniyappa K","initials":"K"}],"title":"Functional characterization of the precursor and spliced forms of RecA protein of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.","pubmed_id":"8639660","type":"J","associated_entries":"1g18, 1g19, 1mo3, 1mo5, 1mo6","doi":"10.1021/bi9517751"}]}
