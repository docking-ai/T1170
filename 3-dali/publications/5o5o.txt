RapZ contributes to the control of glucosamine phosphate biogenesis by selectively presenting the regulatory small RNA GlmZ to the essential ribonuclease RNase E for inactivation. Here, we report the crystal structures of full length Escherichia coli RapZ at 3.40 \u00c5 and 3.25 \u00c5, and its isolated C-terminal domain at 1.17 \u00c5 resolution. The structural data confirm that the N-terminal domain of RapZ possesses a kinase fold, whereas the C-terminal domain bears closest homology to a subdomain of 6-phosphofructokinase, an important enzyme in the glycolytic pathway. RapZ self-associates into a domain swapped dimer of dimers, and in vivo data support the importance of quaternary structure in RNA-mediated regulation of target gene expression. Based on biochemical, structural and genetic data, we suggest a mechanism for binding and presentation by RapZ of GlmZ and the closely related decoy sRNA, GlmY. We discuss a scenario for the molecular evolution of RapZ through re-purpose of enzyme components from central metabolism.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Gonzalez","full_name":"Gonzalez GM","initials":"GM"},{"last_name":"Durica-Mitic","full_name":"Durica-Mitic S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Hardwick","full_name":"Hardwick SW","initials":"SW"},{"last_name":"Moncrieffe","full_name":"Moncrieffe MC","initials":"MC"},{"last_name":"Resch","full_name":"Resch M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Neumann","full_name":"Neumann P","initials":"P"},{"last_name":"Ficner","full_name":"Ficner R","initials":"R"},{"last_name":"G\u00f6rke","full_name":"G\u00f6rke B","initials":"B"},{"last_name":"Luisi","full_name":"Luisi BF","initials":"BF"}],"title":"Structural insights into RapZ-mediated regulation of bacterial amino-sugar metabolism.","pubmed_id":"28977623","type":"J","associated_entries":"5o5q, 5o5s","doi":"10.1093/nar/gkx732"}]}
