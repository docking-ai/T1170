This process is controlled at transcriptional level by CprK, a member of the ubiquitous CRP-FNR family. Here we present the crystal structures of oxidized CprK in presence of the ligand ortho-chlorophenolacetic acid and of reduced CprK in absence of this ligand. These structures reveal that highly specific binding of chlorinated, rather than the corresponding non-chlorinated, phenolic compounds in the NH(2)-terminal beta-barrels causes reorientation of these domains with respect to the central alpha-helix at the dimer interface. Unexpectedly, the COOH-terminal DNA-binding domains dimerize in the non-DNA binding state. We postulate the ligand-induced conformational change allows formation of interdomain contacts that disrupt the DNA domain dimer interface and leads to repositioning of the helix-turn-helix motifs. These structures provide a structural framework for further studies on transcriptional control by CRP-FNR homologs in general and of halorespiration regulation by CprK in particular.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Joyce","full_name":"Joyce MG","initials":"MG"},{"last_name":"Levy","full_name":"Levy C","initials":"C"},{"last_name":"G\u00e1bor","full_name":"G\u00e1bor K","initials":"K"},{"last_name":"Pop","full_name":"Pop SM","initials":"SM"},{"last_name":"Biehl","full_name":"Biehl BD","initials":"BD"},{"last_name":"Doukov","full_name":"Doukov TI","initials":"TI"},{"last_name":"Ryter","full_name":"Ryter JM","initials":"JM"},{"last_name":"Mazon","full_name":"Mazon H","initials":"H"},{"last_name":"Smidt","full_name":"Smidt H","initials":"H"},{"last_name":"van den Heuvel","full_name":"van den Heuvel RH","initials":"RH"},{"last_name":"Ragsdale","full_name":"Ragsdale SW","initials":"SW"},{"last_name":"van der Oost","full_name":"van der Oost J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Leys","full_name":"Leys D","initials":"D"}],"title":"CprK crystal structures reveal mechanism for transcriptional control of halorespiration.","pubmed_id":"16803881","type":"J","associated_entries":"2h6c","doi":"10.1074/jbc.M602654200"}]}
