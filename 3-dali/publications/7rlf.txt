However, the structural basis of its role in such diseases remains elusive. Here, we present cryo-EM structural analyses of four disease mutants p97<sub>R155H</sub>, p97<sub>R191Q</sub>, p97<sub>A232E</sub>, p97<sub>D592N</sub>, as well as p97<sub>E470D</sub>, implicated in resistance to the drug CB-5083, a potent p97 inhibitor. Our cryo-EM structures demonstrate that these mutations affect nucleotide-driven allosteric activation across the three principal p97 domains (N, D1, and D2) by predominantly interfering with either (1) the coupling between the D1 and N-terminal domains (p97<sub>R155H</sub> and p97<sub>R191Q</sub>), (2) the interprotomer interactions (p97<sub>A232E</sub>), or (3) the coupling between D1 and D2 nucleotide domains (p97<sub>D592N</sub>, p97<sub>E470D</sub>). We also show that binding of the competitive inhibitor, CB-5083, to the D2 domain prevents conformational changes similar to those seen for mutations that affect coupling between the D1 and D2 domains. Our studies enable tracing of the path of allosteric activation across p97 and establish a common mechanistic link between active site inhibition and defects in allosteric activation by disease-causing mutations and have potential implications for the design of novel allosteric compounds that can modulate p97 function.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Caffrey","full_name":"Caffrey B","initials":"B"},{"last_name":"Zhu","full_name":"Zhu X","initials":"X"},{"last_name":"Berezuk","full_name":"Berezuk A","initials":"A"},{"last_name":"Tuttle","full_name":"Tuttle K","initials":"K"},{"last_name":"Chittori","full_name":"Chittori S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Subramaniam","full_name":"Subramaniam S","initials":"S"}],"title":"AAA+ ATPase p97/VCP mutants and inhibitor binding disrupt inter-domain coupling and subsequent allosteric activation.","pubmed_id":"34520757","type":"J","associated_entries":"7rl6, 7rl7, 7rl9, 7rla, 7rlb, 7rlc, 7rld, 7rlg, 7rlh, 7rli, 7rlj","doi":"10.1016/j.jbc.2021.101187"}]}
