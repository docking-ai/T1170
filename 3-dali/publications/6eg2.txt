BRM, and its close homolog Brahma related gene 1 (BRG1), also known as SMARCA4, are mutually exclusive ATPase members of the large ATP-dependent SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes involved in transcriptional regulation of gene expression. No small molecules modulating SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling activity via inhibition of its ATPase activity have been reported, an important goal given the well-established dependence of BRG1-deficient cancers on BRM. Here, we describe allosteric dual BRM and BRG1 inhibitors that downregulate BRM-dependent gene expression and show anti-proliferative activity in a BRG1-mutant lung tumor xenograft model upon oral administration. These compounds represent useful tools for understanding the functions of BRM in BRG1 loss-of-function settings, and should enable probing the role of SWI/SNF function more broadly in different cancer contexts and other diseases.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Papillon","full_name":"Papillon JPN","initials":"JPN"},{"last_name":"Nakajima","full_name":"Nakajima K","initials":"K"},{"last_name":"Adair","full_name":"Adair CD","initials":"CD"},{"last_name":"Hempel","full_name":"Hempel J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Jouk","full_name":"Jouk AO","initials":"AO"},{"last_name":"Karki","full_name":"Karki R","initials":"R"},{"last_name":"Mathieu","full_name":"Mathieu S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Moebitz","full_name":"Moebitz H","initials":"H"},{"last_name":"Ntaganda","full_name":"Ntaganda R","initials":"R"},{"last_name":"Smith","full_name":"Smith T","initials":"T"},{"last_name":"Visser","full_name":"Visser M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Hill","full_name":"Hill SE","initials":"SE"},{"last_name":"Kellermann Hurtado","full_name":"Kellermann Hurtado F","initials":"F"},{"last_name":"Chenail","full_name":"Chenail G","initials":"G"},{"last_name":"Bhang","full_name":"Bhang HC","initials":"HC"},{"last_name":"Bric","full_name":"Bric A","initials":"A"},{"last_name":"Xiang","full_name":"Xiang K","initials":"K"},{"last_name":"Bushold","full_name":"Bushold G","initials":"G"},{"last_name":"Gilbert","full_name":"Gilbert T","initials":"T"},{"last_name":"Vattay","full_name":"Vattay A","initials":"A"},{"last_name":"Dooley","full_name":"Dooley J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Costa","full_name":"Costa EA","initials":"EA"},{"last_name":"Park","full_name":"Park I","initials":"I"},{"last_name":"Li","full_name":"Li A","initials":"A"},{"last_name":"Farley","full_name":"Farley D","initials":"D"},{"last_name":"Lounkine","full_name":"Lounkine E","initials":"E"},{"last_name":"Yue","full_name":"Yue QK","initials":"QK"},{"last_name":"Xie","full_name":"Xie X","initials":"X"},{"last_name":"Zhu","full_name":"Zhu X","initials":"X"},{"last_name":"Kulathila","full_name":"Kulathila R","initials":"R"},{"last_name":"King","full_name":"King D","initials":"D"},{"last_name":"Hu","full_name":"Hu T","initials":"T"},{"last_name":"Vulic","full_name":"Vulic K","initials":"K"},{"last_name":"Cantwell","full_name":"Cantwell J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Luu","full_name":"Luu C","initials":"C"},{"last_name":"Jagani","full_name":"Jagani Z","initials":"Z"}],"pubmed_id":"30339381","type":"J"}]}
