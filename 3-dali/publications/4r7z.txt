Here we present the crystal structure of a nearly full-length MCM hexamer that is helicase-active and thus has all features essential for unwinding DNA. The structure is a chimera of Sulfolobus solfataricus N-terminal domain and Pyrococcus furiosus ATPase domain. We discuss three major findings: 1) a novel conformation for the A-subdomain that could play a role in MCM regulation; 2) interaction of a universally conserved glutamine in the N-terminal Allosteric Communication Loop with the AAA+ domain helix-2-insert (h2i); and 3) a recessed binding pocket for the MCM ssDNA-binding motif influenced by the h2i. We suggest that during helicase activation, the h2i clamps down on the leading strand to facilitate strand retention and regulate ATP hydrolysis.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Miller","full_name":"Miller JM","initials":"JM"},{"last_name":"Arachea","full_name":"Arachea BT","initials":"BT"},{"last_name":"Epling","full_name":"Epling LB","initials":"LB"},{"last_name":"Enemark","full_name":"Enemark EJ","initials":"EJ"}],"title":"Analysis of the crystal structure of an active MCM hexamer.","pubmed_id":"25262915","type":"J","associated_entries":"4r7y","doi":"10.7554/eLife.03433"}]}
