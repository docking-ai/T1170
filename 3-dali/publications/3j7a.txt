The emergence of parasite resistance to front-line drugs has prompted a renewed focus on the repositioning of clinically approved drugs as potential anti-malarial therapies. Antibiotics that inhibit protein translation are promising candidates for repositioning. We have solved the cryo-EM structure of the cytoplasmic ribosome from the human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, in complex with emetine at 3.2 \u00c5 resolution. Emetine is an anti-protozoan drug used in the treatment of ameobiasis that also displays potent anti-malarial activity. Emetine interacts with the E-site of the ribosomal small subunit and shares a similar binding site with the antibiotic pactamycin, thereby delivering its therapeutic effect by blocking mRNA/tRNA translocation. As the first cryo-EM structure that visualizes an antibiotic bound to any ribosome at atomic resolution, this establishes cryo-EM as a powerful tool for screening and guiding the design of drugs that target parasite translation machinery.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Wong","full_name":"Wong W","initials":"W"},{"last_name":"Bai","full_name":"Bai XC","initials":"XC"},{"last_name":"Brown","full_name":"Brown A","initials":"A"},{"last_name":"Fernandez","full_name":"Fernandez IS","initials":"IS"},{"last_name":"Hanssen","full_name":"Hanssen E","initials":"E"},{"last_name":"Condron","full_name":"Condron M","initials":"M"},{"last_name":"Tan","full_name":"Tan YH","initials":"YH"},{"last_name":"Baum","full_name":"Baum J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Scheres","full_name":"Scheres SH","initials":"SH"}],"pubmed_id":"24913268","type":"J"}]}
