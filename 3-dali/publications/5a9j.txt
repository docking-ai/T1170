Pol\u03b8 is upregulated in a range of cancer cell types defective in homologous recombination, and knockdown has been shown to inhibit cell survival in a subset of these, making it an attractive target for cancer treatment. We present crystal structures of the helicase domain of human Pol\u03b8 in the presence and absence of bound nucleotides, and a characterization of its DNA-binding and DNA-stimulated ATPase activities. Comparisons with related helicases from the Hel308 family identify several unique features. Pol\u03b8 exists as a tetramer both in the crystals and in solution. We propose a model for DNA binding to the Pol\u03b8 helicase domain in the context of the Pol\u03b8 tetramer, which suggests a role for the helicase domain in strand annealing of DNA templates for subsequent processing by the polymerase domain.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Newman","full_name":"Newman JA","initials":"JA"},{"last_name":"Cooper","full_name":"Cooper CD","initials":"CD"},{"last_name":"Aitkenhead","full_name":"Aitkenhead H","initials":"H"},{"last_name":"Gileadi","full_name":"Gileadi O","initials":"O"}],"pubmed_id":"26636256","type":"J"}]}
