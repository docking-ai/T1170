How such systems coordinate ATPase activity between multiple subunits to power conformational changes that drive the engagement and movement of client substrates is a fundamental question. Using the Escherichia coli Rho transcription termination factor as a model system, we have used solution and crystallographic structural methods to delineate the range of conformational changes that accompany distinct substrate and nucleotide cofactor binding events. Small-angle X-ray scattering data show that Rho preferentially adopts an open-ring state in solution and that RNA and ATP are both required to cooperatively promote ring closure. Multiple closed-ring structures with different RNA substrates and nucleotide occupancies capture distinct catalytic intermediates accessed during translocation. Our data reveal how RNA-induced ring closure templates a sequential ATP-hydrolysis mechanism, provide a molecular rationale for how the Rho ATPase domains distinguishes between distinct RNA sequences, and establish structural snapshots of substepping events in a hexameric helicase/translocase.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Thomsen","full_name":"Thomsen ND","initials":"ND"},{"last_name":"Lawson","full_name":"Lawson MR","initials":"MR"},{"last_name":"Witkowsky","full_name":"Witkowsky LB","initials":"LB"},{"last_name":"Qu","full_name":"Qu S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Berger","full_name":"Berger JM","initials":"JM"}],"pubmed_id":"27856760","type":"J"}]}
