The elucidated N-terminal fragment structure of a putative HsdR subunit from Vibrio vulnificus YJ016 reveals three globular domains. The nucleolytic core within an N-terminal nuclease domain (NTD) is composed of one basic and three acidic residues, which include a metal-binding site. An ATP hydrolase (ATPase) site at the interface of two RecA-like domains (RDs) is located close to the probable DNA-binding site for translocation, which is far from the NTD nucleolytic core. Comparison of relative domain arrangements with other functionally related ATP and/or DNA complex structures suggests a possible translocation and restriction mechanism of the HsdR subunit. Furthermore, careful analysis of its sequence and structure implies that a linker helix connecting two RDs and an extended region within the nuclease domain may play a central role in switching the DNA translocation into the restriction activity.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Uyen","full_name":"Uyen NT","initials":"NT"},{"last_name":"Park","full_name":"Park SY","initials":"SY"},{"last_name":"Choi","full_name":"Choi JW","initials":"JW"},{"last_name":"Lee","full_name":"Lee HJ","initials":"HJ"},{"last_name":"Nishi","full_name":"Nishi K","initials":"K"},{"last_name":"Kim","full_name":"Kim JS","initials":"JS"}],"title":"The fragment structure of a putative HsdR subunit of a type I restriction enzyme from Vibrio vulnificus YJ016: implications for DNA restriction and translocation activity.","pubmed_id":"19625490","type":"B","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1093/nar/gkp603"}]}
