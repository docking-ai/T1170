A key virulence factor of H. pylori is the Cag pathogenicity island, which encodes a type IV secretion system. HP0525 is an essential component of the Cag system and acts as an inner membrane associated ATPase. HP0525 forms double hexameric ring structures, with the C-terminal domains (CTDs) forming a closed ring and the N-terminal domains (NTDs) forming a dynamic, open ring. Here, the crystal structure of HP0525 in complex with a fragment of HP1451, a protein of previously unknown function, is reported. The HP1451 construct consists of two domains similar to nucleic acid-binding domains. Two HP1451 molecules bind to the HP0525 NTDs on opposite sides of the hexamer, locking it in the closed form and forming a partial lid over the HP0525 chamber. From the structure, it is suggested that HP1451 acts as an inhibitory factor of HP0525 to regulate Cag-mediated secretion, a suggestion confirmed by results of in vitro ATPase assay and in vivo pull-down experiments.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Hare","full_name":"Hare S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"Fischer","full_name":"Fischer W","initials":"W"},{"last_name":"Williams","full_name":"Williams R","initials":"R"},{"last_name":"Terradot","full_name":"Terradot L","initials":"L"},{"last_name":"Bayliss","full_name":"Bayliss R","initials":"R"},{"last_name":"Haas","full_name":"Haas R","initials":"R"},{"last_name":"Waksman","full_name":"Waksman G","initials":"G"}],"title":"Identification, structure and mode of action of a new regulator of the Helicobacter pylori HP0525 ATPase.","pubmed_id":"17972918","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1038/sj.emboj.7601904"}]}
