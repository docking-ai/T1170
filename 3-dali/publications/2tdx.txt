The expression of the toxin gene (tox) is regulated by the repressor DtxR, which is activated by transition metal ions. X-ray crystal structures of DtxR with and without (apo-form) its coordinated transition metal ion have established the general architecture of the repressor, identified the location of the metal-binding sites, and revealed a metal-ion-triggered subunit-subunit 'caliper-like' conformational change. Here we report the three-dimensional crystal structure of the complex between a biologically active Ni(II)-bound DtxR(C102D) mutant, in which a cysteine is replaced by an aspartate at residue 102, and a 33-base-pair DNA segment containing the toxin operator toxO. This structure shows that DNA interacts with two dimeric repressor proteins bound to opposite sides of the tox operator. We propose that a metal-ion-induced helix-to-coil structural transition in the amino-terminal region of the protein is partly responsible for the unique mode of repressor activation by transition metal ions.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"White","full_name":"White A","initials":"A"},{"last_name":"Ding","full_name":"Ding X","initials":"X"},{"last_name":"vanderSpek","full_name":"vanderSpek JC","initials":"JC"},{"last_name":"Murphy","full_name":"Murphy JR","initials":"JR"},{"last_name":"Ringe","full_name":"Ringe D","initials":"D"}],"title":"Structure of the metal-ion-activated diphtheria toxin repressor/tox operator complex.","pubmed_id":"9697776","type":"J","associated_entries":"1ddn, 1dpr","doi":"10.1038/28893"},{"journal_info":{"volume":"3","pdb_abbreviation":"Nat.

The previously solved three-dimensional DtxR structures have identified two potential metal ion binding sites which may play a role in the activation of DNA binding by the repressor. We have used both X-ray crystallographic and site-directed mutational analysis of DtxR(C102D)-Ni2+ complexes and DtxR to identify the metal ion-binding site which results in the activation of the repressor. We demonstrate that DtxR contains both a primary and an ancillary metal ion binding site. The primary site functions directly in the activation of DNA binding. In contrast, the ancillary site contributes weakly, if at all, to activation.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Ding","full_name":"Ding X","initials":"X"},{"last_name":"Zeng","full_name":"Zeng H","initials":"H"},{"last_name":"Schiering","full_name":"Schiering N","initials":"N"},{"last_name":"Ringe","full_name":"Ringe D","initials":"D"},{"last_name":"Murphy","full_name":"Murphy JR","initials":"JR"}],"title":"Identification of the primary metal ion-activation sites of the diphtheria tox repressor by X-ray crystallography and site-directed mutational analysis.","pubmed_id":"8599765","type":"J","associated_entries":"1ddn, 1dpr","doi":"10.1038/nsb0496-382"},{"journal_info":{"volume":"3","pdb_abbreviation":"Structure","ISO_abbreviation":"Structure","year":1995,"issue":"1","pages":"87-100"},"abstract":{"methods":null,"conclusions":"The crystal structure of the DtxR holorepressor suggests that the divalent cation co-repressor controls motions of the DNA-binding domain. In this way the metal co-repressor governs the distance between operator recognition elements in the two subunits and, consequently, DNA recognition.","results":"The crystal structure of dimeric DtxR holo-repressor in complex with different transition metals shows that each subunit comprises an amino-terminal DNA-binding domain, an interface domain (which contains two metal-binding sites) and a third, very flexible carboxy-terminal domain. Each DNA-binding domain contains a helix-turn-helix motif and has a topology which is very similar to catabolite gene activator protein (CAP). Molecular modeling suggests that bound DNA adopts a bent conformation with helices alpha 3 of DtxR interacting with the major grooves. The two metal-binding sites lie approximately 10 A apart. Binding site 2 is positioned at a potential hinge region between the DNA-binding and interface domains. Residues 98-108 appear to be crucial for the functioning of the repressor; these provide four of the ligands of the two metal-binding sites and three residues at the other side of the helix which are at the heart of the dimer interface.","unassigned":null,"background":"When Corynebacterium diphtheriae encounters an environment with a low concentration of iron ions, it initiates the synthesis of several virulence factors, including diphtheria toxin.
