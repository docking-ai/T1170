The Mcm2-7 heterohexamer, like other hexameric helicases, is shaped like a ring with two tiers, an N-tier ring composed of the N-terminal domains, and a C-tier of C-terminal domains; the C-tier contains the motor. In principle, either tier could translocate ahead of the other during movement on DNA. We have used cryo-EM single-particle 3D reconstruction to solve the structure of CMG in complex with a DNA fork. The duplex stem penetrates into the central channel of the N-tier and the unwound leading single-strand DNA traverses the channel through the N-tier into the C-tier motor, 5'-3' through CMG. Therefore, the N-tier ring is pushed ahead by the C-tier ring during CMG translocation, opposite the currently accepted polarity. The polarity of the N-tier ahead of the C-tier places the leading Pol \u03b5 below CMG and Pol \u03b1-primase at the top of CMG at the replication fork. Surprisingly, the new N-tier to C-tier polarity of translocation reveals an unforeseen quality-control mechanism at the origin. Thus, upon assembly of head-to-head CMGs that encircle double-stranded DNA at the origin, the two CMGs must pass one another to leave the origin and both must remodel onto opposite strands of single-stranded DNA to do so. We propose that head-to-head motors may generate energy that underlies initial melting at the origin.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Georgescu","full_name":"Georgescu R","initials":"R"},{"last_name":"Yuan","full_name":"Yuan Z","initials":"Z"},{"last_name":"Bai","full_name":"Bai L","initials":"L"},{"last_name":"de Luna Almeida Santos","full_name":"de Luna Almeida Santos R","initials":"R"},{"last_name":"Sun","full_name":"Sun J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Zhang","full_name":"Zhang D","initials":"D"},{"last_name":"Yurieva","full_name":"Yurieva O","initials":"O"},{"last_name":"Li","full_name":"Li H","initials":"H"},{"last_name":"O'Donnell","full_name":"O'Donnell ME","initials":"ME"}],"title":"Structure of eukaryotic CMG helicase at a replication fork and implications to replisome architecture and origin initiation.","pubmed_id":"28096349","type":"J","associated_entries":"5u8s","doi":"10.1073/pnas.1620500114"}]}
