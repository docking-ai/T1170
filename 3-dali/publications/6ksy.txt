When a high ethanol condition is induced to <i>Zymomonas mobilis</i> ZM4, a representative ethanologenic organism, this bacterium overexpresses several genes to overcome this ethanol stress. Among them, we characterized a gene product annotated as an arginase (zmARG) from <i>Z. mobilis</i> ZM4. Even though all of the arginase-determining sequence motifs are not strictly conserved in zmARG, this enzyme converts L-arginine to urea and L-ornithine in the presence of a divalent manganese ion. The revealed high-resolution crystal structure of zmARG shows that it has a typical globular \u03b1/\u03b2 arginase fold with a protruded C-terminal helix. Two zinc ions reside in the active site, where one metal ion is penta-coordinated and the other has six ligands, discerning this zmARG from the reported arginases with two hexa-liganded metal ions. zmARG forms a dimeric structure in solution as well as in the crystalline state. The dimeric assembly of zmARG is formed mainly by interaction formed between the C-terminal \u03b1-helix of one molecule and the \u03b1/\u03b2 hydrolase fold of another molecule. The presented findings demonstrate the first reported dimeric arginase formed by the C-terminal tail and has two metal ions coordinated by different number of ligands.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Hwangbo","full_name":"Hwangbo SA","initials":"SA"},{"last_name":"Kim","full_name":"Kim JW","initials":"JW"},{"last_name":"Jung","full_name":"Jung SJ","initials":"SJ"},{"last_name":"Jin","full_name":"Jin KS","initials":"KS"},{"last_name":"Lee","full_name":"Lee JO","initials":"JO"},{"last_name":"Kim","full_name":"Kim JS","initials":"JS"},{"last_name":"Park","full_name":"Park SY","initials":"SY"}],"title":"Characterization of a Dimeric Arginase From <i>Zymomonas mobilis</i> ZM4.","pubmed_id":"32038508","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.3389/fmicb.2019.02755"}]}
