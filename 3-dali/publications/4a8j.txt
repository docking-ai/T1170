It has also attracted clinical attention because of its role in certain neurodegenerative diseases. Here we describe the crystal structure of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae subcomplex of Elongator proteins 4, 5 and 6 (Elp456). The subunits each show almost identical RecA folds that form a heterohexameric ring-like structure resembling hexameric RecA-like ATPases. This structural finding is supported by different complementary in vitro and in vivo approaches, including the specific binding of the hexameric Elp456 subcomplex to tRNAs in a manner regulated by ATP. Our results support a role of Elongator in tRNA modification, explain the importance of each of the Elp4, Elp5 and Elp6 subunits for complex integrity and suggest a model for the overall architecture of the holo-Elongator complex.","background":null,"objective":null},"author_list":[{"last_name":"Glatt","full_name":"Glatt S","initials":"S"},{"last_name":"L\u00e9toquart","full_name":"L\u00e9toquart J","initials":"J"},{"last_name":"Faux","full_name":"Faux C","initials":"C"},{"last_name":"Taylor","full_name":"Taylor NM","initials":"NM"},{"last_name":"S\u00e9raphin","full_name":"S\u00e9raphin B","initials":"B"},{"last_name":"M\u00fcller","full_name":"M\u00fcller CW","initials":"CW"}],"title":"The Elongator subcomplex Elp456 is a hexameric RecA-like ATPase.","pubmed_id":"22343726","type":"J","associated_entries":null,"doi":"10.1038/nsmb.2234"}]}
